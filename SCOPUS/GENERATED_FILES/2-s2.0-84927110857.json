There has long been fervent debate about how these events affected dinosaurs. We review a wealth of new data accumulated over the past two decades, provide updated and novel analyses of long-term dinosaur diversity trends during the latest Cretaceous, and discuss an emerging consensus on the extinction's tempo and causes. Little support exists for a global, long-term decline across non-avian dinosaur diversity prior to their extinction at the end of the Cretaceous. However, restructuring of latest Cretaceous dinosaur faunas in North America led to reduced diversity of large-bodied herbivores, perhaps making communities more susceptible to cascading extinctions. The abruptness of the dinosaur extinction suggests a key role for the bolide impact, although the coarseness of the fossil record makes testing the effects of Deccan volcanism difficult.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chicxulub impact", "Cretaceous-Paleogene", "Deccan Traps", "Dinosaurs", "End-Cretaceous", "Extinctions", "Global change", "Macroevolution", "Mass extinction", "Palaeontology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biodiversity", "Dinosaurs", "Extinction, Biological", "Fossils"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927110857", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"18233445200": {"Name": "Brusatte S.", "AuthorID": "18233445200", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of GeoSciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "35236406100": {"Name": "Butler R.", "AuthorID": "35236406100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7202120420": {"Name": "Barrett P.", "AuthorID": "7202120420", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "6701447377": {"Name": "Carrano M.", "AuthorID": "6701447377", "AffiliationID": "60015033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paleobiology, Smithsonian Institution"}, "55302970000": {"Name": "Evans D.", "AuthorID": "55302970000", "AffiliationID": "60004044", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural History, Royal Ontario Museum"}, "36486744600": {"Name": "Lloyd G.", "AuthorID": "36486744600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "25632385300": {"Name": "Mannion P.", "AuthorID": "25632385300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Science and Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7004672166": {"Name": "Norell M.", "AuthorID": "7004672166", "AffiliationID": "60011425", "AffiliationName": "Division of Paleontology, American Museum of Natural History"}, "16314264500": {"Name": "Peppe D.", "AuthorID": "16314264500", "AffiliationID": "60011278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, Baylor University"}, "6701733955": {"Name": "Upchurch P.", "AuthorID": "6701733955", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7102228353": {"Name": "Williamson T.", "AuthorID": "7102228353", "AffiliationID": "60007052", "AffiliationName": "New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science"}}}
