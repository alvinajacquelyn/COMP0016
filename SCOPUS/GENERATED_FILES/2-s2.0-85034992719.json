We utilised the latest socioeconomic datasets to compile China's 2012 multiregional input-output (MRIO) table. Environmentally extended input-output analysis and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) were applied to investigate the driving forces behind changes in CO2 emissions embodied in China's domestic and foreign trade from 2007 to 2012. Here we show that emission flow patterns have changed greatly in both domestic and foreign trade since the financial crisis. Some economically less developed regions, such as Southwest China, have shifted from being a net emission exporter to being a net emission importer. In terms of foreign trade, emissions embodied in China's exports declined from 2007 to 2012 mainly due to changes in production structure and efficiency gains, while developing countries became the major destination of China's export emissions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034992719", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Water Security Research Centre, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "56015318000": {"Name": "Shan Y.", "AuthorID": "56015318000", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Water Security Research Centre, School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "57196426525": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57196426525", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "26422516400": {"Name": "Song M.", "AuthorID": "26422516400", "AffiliationID": "60108842", "AffiliationName": "School of Statistics and Applied Mathematics, Anhui University of Finance and Economics"}, "13005705700": {"Name": "Wei Y.M.", "AuthorID": "13005705700", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "55802235200": {"Name": "Hubacek K.", "AuthorID": "55802235200", "AffiliationID": "60029543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Studies, Masaryk University"}}}
