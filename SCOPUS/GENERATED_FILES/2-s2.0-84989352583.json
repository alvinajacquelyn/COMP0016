We describe a 38 year old male carrying a 100% methylated FM detected with Southern blot (SB), which is consistent with complete silencing of FMR1 and a diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. However, his formal cognitive scores were not at the most severe end of the FXS phenotype and he displayed tremor and ataxic gait. With the association of UFM with FXTAS, we speculated that his ataxia might be related to an undetected proportion of UFM alleles. Such UFM alleles were confirmed by more sensitive PCR based methylation testing showing FM methylation between 60% and 70% in blood, buccal, and saliva samples and real-time PCR analysis showing incomplete silencing of FMR1. While he did not meet diagnostic criteria for FXTAS based on MRI findings, the underlying cause of his ataxia may be related to UFM alleles not detected by SB, and follow-up clinical and molecular assessment are justified if his symptoms worsen.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AmplideX", "Ataxia", "FMR1", "Fragile X syndrome", "FXTAS", "Methylation", "Mosaicism", "RNA toxicity", "Southern blot", "Tremor"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989352583", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57191375627": {"Name": "Hwang Y.T.", "AuthorID": "57191375627", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6701579672": {"Name": "Dudding T.", "AuthorID": "6701579672", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "Grow UpWell Priority Research Centre, University of Newcastle"}, "36060139100": {"Name": "Rogers C.", "AuthorID": "36060139100", "AffiliationID": "102023213", "AffiliationName": "Genetics of Learning Disability Service, Hunger Genetics"}, "55878266800": {"Name": "Aliaga S.M.", "AuthorID": "55878266800", "AffiliationID": "60012464", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cytogenetics Laboratory, INTA University of Chile"}, "56002226300": {"Name": "Arpone M.", "AuthorID": "56002226300", "AffiliationID": "60024749, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "7401512928": {"Name": "Francis D.", "AuthorID": "7401512928", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Cyto-molecular Diagnostic Research Laboratory, Victorian Clinical Genetics Services and Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "56244866400": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "56244866400", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Cyto-molecular Diagnostic Research Laboratory, Victorian Clinical Genetics Services and Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57210774767": {"Name": "Slater H.R.", "AuthorID": "57210774767", "AffiliationID": "60024749, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "8720291200": {"Name": "Godler D.E.", "AuthorID": "8720291200", "AffiliationID": "60012464", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cytogenetics Laboratory, INTA University of Chile"}, "6508189528": {"Name": "Bretherton L.", "AuthorID": "6508189528", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Child Neuropsychology, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57196038628": {"Name": "du Sart D.", "AuthorID": "57196038628", "AffiliationID": "60026489, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Victorian Clinical Genetics Services and Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal children\u2019s Hospital"}, "57214021423": {"Name": "Heard R.", "AuthorID": "57214021423", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60003992", "AffiliationName": "Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney"}}}
