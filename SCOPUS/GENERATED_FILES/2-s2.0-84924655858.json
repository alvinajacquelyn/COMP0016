Decision making is characterized by the parallel engagement of two distinct systems, goal-directed and habitual, thought to arise from two computational learning mechanisms, model-based and model-free. The habitual system is a candidate source of pathological fixedness. Using a decision task that measures the contribution to learning of either mechanism, we show a bias towards model-free (habit) acquisition in disorders involving both natural (binge eating) and artificial (methamphetamine) rewards, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This favoring of model-free learning may underlie the repetitive behaviors that ultimately dominate in these disorders. Further, we show that the habit formation bias is associated with lower gray matter volumes in caudate and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that the dysfunction in a common neurocomputational mechanism may underlie diverse disorders involving compulsion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Bias (Epidemiology)", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Choice Behavior", "Computer Simulation", "Female", "Habits", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Regression Analysis", "Reward", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924655858", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"8449219500": {"Name": "Voon V.", "AuthorID": "8449219500", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55511175000": {"Name": "Irvine M.A.", "AuthorID": "55511175000", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hospital"}, "7007103224": {"Name": "Sahakian B.J.", "AuthorID": "7007103224", "AffiliationID": "60032894, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "35405771500": {"Name": "Bullmore E.T.", "AuthorID": "35405771500", "AffiliationID": "114286992", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre"}, "15123403200": {"Name": "Worbe Y.", "AuthorID": "15123403200", "AffiliationID": "60032894, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "50161540900": {"Name": "Gillan C.", "AuthorID": "50161540900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}, "55854740500": {"Name": "Robbins T.W.", "AuthorID": "55854740500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}, "55763422400": {"Name": "Wood J.", "AuthorID": "55763422400", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55443666800": {"Name": "Derbyshire K.", "AuthorID": "55443666800", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neuroscience, University of Chicago"}, "26668021000": {"Name": "Schreiber L.R.N.", "AuthorID": "26668021000", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota"}, "7403161219": {"Name": "Grant J.E.", "AuthorID": "7403161219", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Neuroscience, University of Chicago"}, "6603630881": {"Name": "R\u00fcck C.", "AuthorID": "6603630881", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Karolinska Institute"}, "55438088200": {"Name": "Enander J.", "AuthorID": "55438088200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Karolinska Institute"}, "35413253200": {"Name": "Fineberg N.A.", "AuthorID": "35413253200", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Hertfordshire"}, "21742835700": {"Name": "Harrison N.A.", "AuthorID": "21742835700", "AffiliationID": "60017317, 60100018", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Imaging Sciences Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex"}, "7005134854": {"Name": "Daw N.D.", "AuthorID": "7005134854", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neural Science, Department of Psychology, New York University"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
