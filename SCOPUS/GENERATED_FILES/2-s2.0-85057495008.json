Genetic Epidemiology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Observational studies find an association between increased body mass index (BMI) and short self-reported sleep duration in adults. However, the underlying biological mechanisms that underpin these associations are unclear. Recent findings from the UK Biobank suggest a weak genetic correlation between BMI and self-reported sleep duration. However, the potential shared genetic aetiology between these traits has not been examined using a comprehensive approach. To investigate this, we created a polygenic risk score (PRS) of BMI and examined its association with self-reported sleep duration in a combination of individual participant data and summary-level data, with a total sample size of 142,209 individuals. Although we observed a nonsignificant genetic correlation between BMI and sleep duration, using LD score regression (r g = \u22120.067 [SE = 0.039], P = 0.092) we found that a PRS of BMI is associated with a decrease in sleep duration (unstandardized coefficient = \u22121.75 min [SE = 0.67], P = 6.13 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ), but explained only 0.02% of the variance in sleep duration. Our findings suggest that BMI and self-reported sleep duration possess a small amount of shared genetic aetiology and other mechanisms must underpin these associations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["body mass index", "genetic correlation", "polygenic risk score", "sleep duration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Body Mass Index", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Obesity", "Phenotype", "Self Report", "Sleep", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057495008", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56414855500": {"Name": "Garfield V.", "AuthorID": "56414855500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Science & Experimental Medicine, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "24471042200": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.H.", "AuthorID": "24471042200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Sciences & Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Sciences & Health, University College London"}, "36484367300": {"Name": "Fatemifar G.", "AuthorID": "36484367300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57193912536": {"Name": "Dale C.", "AuthorID": "57193912536", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "56542902700": {"Name": "Smart M.", "AuthorID": "56542902700", "AffiliationID": "60102147, 60001359", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex"}, "17345334100": {"Name": "Bao Y.", "AuthorID": "17345334100", "AffiliationID": "60102147, 60001359", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex"}, "57189230664": {"Name": "Kumari M.", "AuthorID": "57189230664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London"}, "12768928900": {"Name": "Zabaneh D.", "AuthorID": "12768928900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic & Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
