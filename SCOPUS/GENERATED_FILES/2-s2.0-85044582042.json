Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society.R-matrix calculations combined with the adiabatic-nuclei-rotation and Coulomb-Born approximations are used to compute electron-impact rotational rate coefficients for two open-shell diatomic cations of astrophysical interest: the hydoxyl and sulphanyl ions, OH+ and SH+. Hyperfine resolved rate coefficients are deduced using the infinite-order-sudden approximation. The propensity rule \u0394F = \u0394j = \u0394N=\u00b11 is observed, as is expected for cations with a large dipole moment. A model for OH+ excitation in the Orion Bar photon-dominated region is presented which nicely reproduces Herschel observations for an electron fraction xe = 10-4 and an OH+ column density of 3\u00d71013 cm-2. Electron-impact electronic excitation cross-sections and rate coefficients for the ions are also presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ISM: molecules", "Line: formation", "Molecular data", "Molecular processes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044582042", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57139414500": {"Name": "Hamilton J.R.", "AuthorID": "57139414500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College, London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College, London"}, "7006688769": {"Name": "Faure A.", "AuthorID": "7006688769", "AffiliationID": "60104653, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "University Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, IPAG"}}}
