Within this quantum-classical regime, spatial delocalisations of individual ionisation event sites that are generated outside the target region are calculated, and particular attention is given to the validity of using classical transport methods in simulations of nanodosimetric parameters such as mean cluster size, first and second moments, variance and cumulative frequency of ionisation cluster-size probability distributions. This paper presents the comparison between conventionally calculated nanodosimetric quantities and the ones where interacting particles are treated semi-classically with spatial uncertainties satisfied by HUP. The simulated primary charged particles are electrons of energies between 100 eV and 1 keV in DNA equivalent target aqueous water volumes using GEANT4-DNA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classical transport", "Cluster-size distribution", "Cumulative frequencies", "Heisenberg's uncertainty", "Heisenberg's Uncertainty principle", "Interacting particles", "Low energy electrons", "Spatial uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947208586", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57199787400": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "57199787400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}, "6701569343": {"Name": "Palmans H.", "AuthorID": "6701569343", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "56963374300": {"Name": "Hao L.", "AuthorID": "56963374300", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Royal Surrey County Hospital"}}}
