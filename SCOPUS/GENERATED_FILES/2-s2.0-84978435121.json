In contrast, where alternative modalities of healing are practiced, relationships go beyond a dyadic interaction and include wider social networks. In this article, we propose the existence of a \u2018therapeutic unit\u2019 in Maya healing practices in Guatemala that binds healer, wellness seeker, family, and community members, along with the spiritual and natural realms, into a coherent system requiring all of these elements to achieve success. Drawing on interviews with 67 Maya healers, we describe healers\u2019 understanding of raxnaq\u2019il nuk\u2019aslemal (well-being), and show how these interactions activate wider networks that play crucial roles during treatments. We highlight how holism is expressed in relationships typical of indigenous healing systems, and how an appreciation of this is important for developing culturally appropriate health care provision systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Guatemala", "holism", "indigenous therapy", "Maya medicine", "traditional healing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anthropology, Medical", "Guatemala", "Humans", "Medicine, Traditional", "Professional-Patient Relations", "Spiritual Therapies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978435121", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"57021758000": {"Name": "Berger-Gonz\u00e1lez M.", "AuthorID": "57021758000", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH, Institute for Environmental Decisions"}, "57190215676": {"Name": "Vides-Porras A.", "AuthorID": "57190215676", "AffiliationID": "60008827", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology of the University of Wyoming"}, "57190218669": {"Name": "Strauss S.", "AuthorID": "57190218669", "AffiliationID": "60008827", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology of the University of Wyoming"}, "16156235300": {"Name": "Heinrich M.", "AuthorID": "16156235300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of London"}, "57190217094": {"Name": "Taquir\u00e1 S.", "AuthorID": "57190217094", "AffiliationID": "117014149", "AffiliationName": "Consejo Mayor de Guias Espirituales y Medicos Mayas"}, "6505582510": {"Name": "Kr\u00fctli P.", "AuthorID": "6505582510", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH, Institute for Environmental Decisions"}}}
