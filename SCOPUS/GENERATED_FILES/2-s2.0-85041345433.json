Clusterin, an extracellular chaperone and regulator of cell functions, is reduced in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with pulmonary fibrosis. However, its distribution and role in normal and fibrotic human lung are incompletely characterized. Immunohistochemical localization of clusterin revealed strong staining associated with fibroblasts in control lung and morphologically normal areas of fibrotic lung but weak or undetectable staining in fibrotic regions and particularly fibroblastic foci. Clusterin also co-localized with elastin in vessel walls and additionally with amorphous elastin deposits in fibrotic lung. Analysis of primary lung fibroblast isolates in vitro confirmed the down-regulation of clusterin expression in fibrotic compared with control lung fibroblasts and further demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 is capable of down-regulating fibroblast clusterin expression. shRNA-mediated down-regulation of clusterin did not affect TGF-\u03b21-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation but inhibited fibroblast proliferative responses and sensitized to apoptosis. Down-regulation of clusterin in fibrotic lung fibroblasts at least partly due to increased TGF-\u03b21 may therefore represent an appropriate but insufficient response to limit fibroproliferation. Reduced expression of clusterin in the lung may also limit its extracellular chaperoning activity contributing to dysregulated deposition of extracellular matrix proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Clusterin", "Down-Regulation", "Elastin", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Protective Agents", "Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Signal Transduction", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041345433", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56771402200": {"Name": "Peix L.", "AuthorID": "56771402200", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}, "8848841800": {"Name": "Evans I.", "AuthorID": "8848841800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Woman's Health, University College London"}, "57189630390": {"Name": "Pearce D.", "AuthorID": "57189630390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Building, University College London"}, "7005878656": {"Name": "McAnulty R.", "AuthorID": "7005878656", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Building, University College London"}, "56799189700": {"Name": "Maher T.", "AuthorID": "56799189700", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Fibrosis Research Group, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College"}, "55448740100": {"Name": "Simpson J.", "AuthorID": "55448740100", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline"}}}
