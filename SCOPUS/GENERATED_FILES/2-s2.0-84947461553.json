This model describes the motion of a chemically reacting heat-conducting gaseous mixture. The viscosity coefficients are density-dependent functions vanishing in a vacuum and the internal pressure depends on species concentrations. By several levels of approximation we prove the global-in-time existence of weak solutions on the three-dimensional torus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemically reacting gas", "Compressible Navier'stokes-Fourier system", "Maxwell'stefan equations", "Mixtures", "Weak solutions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Existence of weak solutions", "Fourier", "Multi-component diffusion", "Reacting gas", "Species concentration", "Stefan equation", "Viscosity coefficient", "Weak solution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947461553", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56239308700": {"Name": "Mucha P.", "AuthorID": "56239308700", "AffiliationID": "60110679, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw"}, "36717202900": {"Name": "Zatorska E.", "AuthorID": "36717202900", "AffiliationID": "60105987, 60013425", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Math\u00e9matiques Appliqu\u00e9es, \u00c9cole Polytechnique"}, "7006069560": {"Name": "Pokorn\u00fd M.", "AuthorID": "7006069560", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Mathematical Institute of Charles University"}}}
