Muscle & Nerve published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Introduction: Ambulatory individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) experience muscle weakness, gait impairments, and fatigue that affect their walking ability. Improvements have been observed in motor function in children treated with nusinersen, but its impact on fatigue has not been studied. Methods: Post hoc analyses were used to examine changes in 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance and fatigue in children and adolescents with SMA type II and III who received their first dose of nusinersen in the phase Ib/IIa, open-label CS2 study and were ambulatory during CS2 or the extension study, CS12. Results: Fourteen children performed the 6MWT. Median (25th, 75th percentile) distance walked increased over time by 98.0 (62.0, 135.0) meters at day 1050, whereas median fatigue changed by \u22123.8% (\u221219.7%, 1.4%). Discussion: These results support previous studies demonstrating clinically meaningful effects of nusinersen on motor function in children and adolescents with later-onset SMA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["6-minute walk test", "fatigue", "neuromuscular junction", "nusinersen", "spinal muscular atrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Fatigue", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Muscular Atrophy, Spinal", "Oligonucleotides", "Walk Test"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070304607", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"34571823000": {"Name": "Montes J.", "AuthorID": "34571823000", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "57204270869": {"Name": "De Vivo D.C.", "AuthorID": "57204270869", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department Pediatrics, Columbia University Irving Medical Center"}, "57189461082": {"Name": "Dunaway Young S.", "AuthorID": "57189461082", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "24385616400": {"Name": "Mazzone E.S.", "AuthorID": "24385616400", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Catholic University"}, "57211220608": {"Name": "Mercuri E.", "AuthorID": "57211220608", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Catholic University"}, "40262324600": {"Name": "Pasternak A.", "AuthorID": "40262324600", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "55786064900": {"Name": "Darras B.T.", "AuthorID": "55786064900", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "6506611156": {"Name": "Glanzman A.M.", "AuthorID": "6506611156", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Therapy, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}, "7006041140": {"Name": "Finkel R.S.", "AuthorID": "7006041140", "AffiliationID": "60026523", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Nemours Children's Hospital"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and NIHR Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}, "35278138000": {"Name": "Bishop K.M.", "AuthorID": "35278138000", "AffiliationID": "60000871", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Development and Antisense Research, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc"}, "57192412792": {"Name": "Schneider E.", "AuthorID": "57192412792", "AffiliationID": "60000871", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Development and Antisense Research, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc"}, "55665460000": {"Name": "Bennett C.F.", "AuthorID": "55665460000", "AffiliationID": "60000871", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Development and Antisense Research, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc"}, "57200686700": {"Name": "Foster R.", "AuthorID": "57200686700", "AffiliationID": "60111209", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics, Biogen, Maidenhead"}, "57204522305": {"Name": "Farwell W.", "AuthorID": "57204522305", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Development, Biogen"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
