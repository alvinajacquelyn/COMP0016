All rights reserved.A pure sensory neuronopathy (also referred to as a sensory ganglionopathy) is one of a handful of classical neurological paraneoplastic syndromes. Current guidelines recommend that in cases of sensory neuronopathy, a search for an underlying malignancy be pursued for up to 4 years. We report the case of a 52-year-old woman with a sensory neuronopathy who was eventually diagnosed with a cholangiocarcinoma 6 years after the onset of her disease. A CT fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan performed 18 and 24 months after disease onset failed to identify an underlying neoplasm. Immunomodulatory treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and plasma exchange were ineffective. Investigations for Sjogren's disease were negative. A third FDG-PET performed 6 years after symptom onset identified a cholangiocarcinoma, which was confirmed histologically following open resection. Since the tumour was removed, our patient's condition has not progressed, but there has been no improvement and she remains severely disabled.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hepatic cancer", "neuromuscular disease", "peripheral nerve disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bile Duct Neoplasms", "Cholangiocarcinoma", "Delayed Diagnosis", "Female", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Nervous System Diseases", "Neural Conduction", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Sensation Disorders", "Time Factors", "Wheelchairs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039781140", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57218107544": {"Name": "Rossor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218107544", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7201880572": {"Name": "Blake J.", "AuthorID": "7201880572", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysiology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8272373800": {"Name": "Pissanou T.", "AuthorID": "8272373800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
