Experimental Approach Automated electrophysiology was used to study the pharmacology of AZSMO-23 on wild-type (WT), Y652A, F656T or G628C/S631C hERG, and on other cardiac ion channels. Its mechanism of action was characterized with conventional electrophysiology. Key Results AZSMO-23 activated WT hERG pre-pulse and tail current with EC50 values of 28.6 and 11.2 \u03bcM respectively. At 100 \u03bcM, pre-pulse current at +40 mV was increased by 952 \u00b1 41% and tail current at -30 mV by 238 \u00b1 13% compared with vehicle values. The primary mechanism for this effect was a 74.5 mV depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation, without any shift in the voltage dependence of activation. Structure-activity relationships for this effect were remarkably subtle, with close analogues of AZSMO-23 acting as hERG inhibitors. AZSMO-23 blocked the mutant channel, hERG Y652A, but against another mutant channel, hERG F656T, its activator activity was enhanced. It inhibited activity of the G628C/S631C non-inactivating hERG mutant channel. AZSMO-23 was not hERG selective, as it blocked hKv4.3-hKChIP2.2, hCav3.2 and hKv1.5 and activated hCav1.2/\u03b22/\u03b12\u03b4 channels. Conclusion and Implications The activity of AZSMO-23 and those of its close analogues suggest these compounds may be of value to elucidate the mechanism of type 2 hERG activators to better understand the pharmacology of this area from both a safety perspective and in relation to treatment of congenital long QT syndrome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Benzimidazoles", "Cell Line", "CHO Cells", "Cricetinae", "Cricetulus", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Ether-A-Go-Go Potassium Channels", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Ion Channels", "Niacinamide", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930209295", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"6507769109": {"Name": "Mannikko R.", "AuthorID": "6507769109", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "14324207600": {"Name": "Bridgland-Taylor M.H.", "AuthorID": "14324207600", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Drug Safety and Metabolism, Mereside, AstraZeneca RandD"}, "56592768600": {"Name": "Pye H.", "AuthorID": "56592768600", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Drug Safety and Metabolism, Mereside, AstraZeneca RandD"}, "7004241599": {"Name": "Swallow S.", "AuthorID": "7004241599", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Drug Safety and Metabolism, Mereside, AstraZeneca RandD"}, "6602761220": {"Name": "Abi-Gerges N.", "AuthorID": "6602761220", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Drug Safety and Metabolism, Mereside, AstraZeneca RandD"}, "57215506607": {"Name": "Morton M.J.", "AuthorID": "57215506607", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Drug Safety and Metabolism, Mereside, AstraZeneca RandD"}, "7006671945": {"Name": "Pollard C.E.", "AuthorID": "7006671945", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Drug Safety and Metabolism, Mereside, AstraZeneca RandD"}}}
