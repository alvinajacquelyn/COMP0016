This study set out to investigate its relevance to pupils with social, emotional and behavioural difficulties (SEBD) in the United Kingdom who might meet the criteria for a diagnosis of conduct disorder (CD). Limited prosocial emotions were assessed using a measure of callous-unemotional (CU) interpersonal style, and their relationship with social behaviour, social status and self-concept was investigated among children aged 8\u201311 years with identified SEBD (N = 54) using teacher, peer and self-report measures. Findings demonstrated that higher scores on the specifier were associated with more severe problems in all but one of the domains investigated. Higher CU scores were positively associated with teacher and peer-assessed antisocial behaviour and with social rejection. The association between CU scores and social acceptance by peers was negative. However, associations between CU scores and self-perceptions, including social self-perception, were small and non-significant. Thus, despite being socially rejected and rated more negatively by peers than children with low CU levels, the social self-concept of children with elevated CU levels was not lower. Implications for assessment and the differentiation of interventions are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["callous-unemotional interpersonal style", "emotional and behavioural difficulties", "self-concept", "social", "social status"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945444299", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55555117100": {"Name": "Warren L.", "AuthorID": "55555117100", "AffiliationID": "60111042", "AffiliationName": "Buckinghamshire County Council, Educational Psychology Service"}, "6603587474": {"Name": "Frederickson N.", "AuthorID": "6603587474", "AffiliationID": "60111042", "AffiliationName": "Buckinghamshire County Council, Educational Psychology Service"}, "23018669000": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "23018669000", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths College, University of London"}}}
