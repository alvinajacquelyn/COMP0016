As discussed below, the microporous structure of the materials allows for the adsorption and diffusion of small- to medium-sized molecules into their pores\u2014processes that are of crucial importance for the applications in both separations and catalysis. Studies of molecular diffusion are therefore a core area of zeolite science. As sorption and diffusion studies in zeolites are strongly focussed on hydrogen-containing molecules, neutron-based techniques have proved to be particularly effective in elucidating and quantifying the microscopic processes of molecular diffusion; and the interpretation of the data obtained from these techniques can be significantly enhanced by the concerted use of molecular simulation techniques. This chapter therefore outlines some notable studies using quasielastic neutron scattering probing molecular transport and dynamics in zeolites, which we place into the broader context of the investigation of sorbate behavior in these widely studied materials. Though we have focused on this specific class of materials, we note the applicability of all the following techniques to other classes of porous or framework materials (e.g., metal organic frameworks, carbon nanotubes, clathrates, polymers, and porous carbons).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catalyst", "Diffusion", "EISF", "Faujasite", "Fluid catalytic cracking", "Methanol to hydrocarbons", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Molecular rotation", "Quasielastic neutron scattering", "Zeolite", "ZSM-5"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024848788", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55913822400": {"Name": "O'Malley A.J.", "AuthorID": "55913822400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Department of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
