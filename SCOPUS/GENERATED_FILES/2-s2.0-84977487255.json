Intraluminal bisacodyl is routinely used to trigger high-amplitude propagating contractions (HAPCs), a feature of normal colonic motility. Usually, only a single dose (0.2 mg/kg) is suggested. We retrospectively explored whether the use of an additional higher (0.4 mg/kg) dose of bisacodyl increases the yield of colonic manometry. Methods: In 103 children (median age: 8.8 years, range 3.2\u201315.7 years) with a diagnosis of slow transit constipation, colonic motility was recorded for 1 h before and 1 h after each of two incremental doses of bisacodyl (low, L, dose: 0.2 mg/kg, max 10 mg; high, H, dose: 0.4 mg/kg, max 20 mg) and the characteristics of HAPCs analyzed. Key Results: High-amplitude propagating contractions were seen in 85 children. H dose significantly increased the proportion of patients with fully propagated HAPCs (H dose: 57/103 [55%], L dose: 27/103 [26%], p < 0.001), paralleling the significant decrease in the proportion with partially propagated HAPCs (H dose: 29/103 [28%], L dose: 47/103 [46%], p < 0.01). Mean HAPC number significantly increased throughout the colon at H compared to L dose (7.2 \u00b1 5.05 vs 5.6 \u00b1 5.1, p < 0.05). Finally, the proportion of patients with normal pressure wave morphology of HAPCs significantly increased with higher dose (H dose: 55/85 [65%], L dose: 27/85 [32%], p < 0.001). Conclusions & Interferences: An additional higher dose of bisacodyl during colonic manometry improves colonic neuromuscular function suggesting its use might improve interpretation and decision making in children with slow transit constipation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bisacodyl", "children", "chronic constipation", "colonic manometry", "diagnosis", "motility test", "refractory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Bisacodyl", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Colon", "Constipation", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Motility", "Humans", "Laxatives", "Male", "Manometry", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977487255", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"6602467294": {"Name": "Borrelli O.", "AuthorID": "6602467294", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "39062115700": {"Name": "Pescarin M.", "AuthorID": "39062115700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55774919200": {"Name": "Saliakellis E.", "AuthorID": "55774919200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55587499400": {"Name": "Tambucci R.", "AuthorID": "55587499400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "26642072000": {"Name": "Quitadamo P.", "AuthorID": "26642072000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "36807199700": {"Name": "Valitutti F.", "AuthorID": "36807199700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "8638031200": {"Name": "Rybak A.", "AuthorID": "8638031200", "AffiliationID": "60087496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Nutrition Disorders and Pediatrics, Children's Memorial Health Institute"}, "7003568688": {"Name": "Lindley K.J.", "AuthorID": "7003568688", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurogastroenterology & Motility, Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
