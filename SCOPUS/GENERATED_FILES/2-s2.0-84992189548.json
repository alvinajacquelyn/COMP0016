Based on the time switching (TS) and power splitting (PS) receiver architectures, an adaptive receiving architecture for energy harvesting and information processing is proposed and an adaptive relaying (AR) protocol based on it is developed to enable energy harvesting and information processing at the relay. In light of this, analytical expressions of throughput are derived for both delay-limited transmission and delay-Tolerant transmission modes, when the AR protocol is implemented at the relay. Monte Carlo simulations are provided throughout to validate our analysis and the impact of some important system parameters on the adopted performance metric are investigated. In addition, we compare the system performance in terms of the throughput of AR protocol with PS relaying and TS relaying protocols proposed by Nasir et al. Results show that, the AR protocol has a better system performance around the point in which there is a throughput crossover for both PS relaying and TS relaying protocols.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cooperative Communications", "Energy harvesting", "Relaying Protocol.", "Wireless Power Transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive relaying protocols", "Amplify-and-forward relaying", "Analytical expressions", "Performance metrices", "Radiofrequency signals", "Receiver architecture", "Relaying protocols", "Wireless power transfer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992189548", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57220557013": {"Name": "Tao R.", "AuthorID": "57220557013", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "57044158800": {"Name": "Salem A.", "AuthorID": "57044158800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}, "8914581700": {"Name": "Hamdi K.A.", "AuthorID": "8914581700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}}}
