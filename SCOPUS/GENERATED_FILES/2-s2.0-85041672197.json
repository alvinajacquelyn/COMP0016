Since physical activity is protective against cardiovascular disease and heart failure, we investigated whether higher levels of physical activity, and less sedentary behaviour were associated with lower NT-proBNP and hsTnT. Methods and results Cross sectional study of 1130 men, age 70\u201391 years, from the British Regional Heart Study, measured in 2010\u20132012. Fasting blood samples were analysed for NT-proBNP and hsTnT. Physical activity and sedentary behaviour were measured using ActiGraph GT3X accelerometers. Relationships between activity and NT-proBNP or hsTnT were non-linear; biomarker levels were lower with higher total activity, steps, moderate/vigorous activity and light activity only at low to moderate levels of activity. For example, for each additional 10 min of moderate/vigorous activity, NT-proBNP was lower by 35.7% (95% CI \u2212 47.9, \u2212 23.6) and hsTnT by 8.4% (95% CI -11.1, \u2212 5.6), in men who undertook < 25 or 50 min of moderate/vigorous activity per day respectively. Biomarker levels increased linearly with increasing sedentary behaviour, but not independently of moderate/vigorous activity. Conclusion Associations between biomarkers and moderate/vigorous activity (and between hsTnT and light activity) were independent of sedentary behaviour, suggesting activity is driving the relationships. In these older men with concomitantly low levels of physical activity, activity may be more important in protecting against cardiac health deterioration in less active individuals, although reverse causality might be operating.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Men", "N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide", "Physical activity", "Sedentary behaviour", "Troponin T"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Exercise", "Humans", "Male", "Natriuretic Peptide, Brain", "Peptide Fragments", "Population Surveillance", "Troponin T"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041672197", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57169774400": {"Name": "Parsons T.J.", "AuthorID": "57169774400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health"}, "55811454000": {"Name": "Sartini C.", "AuthorID": "55811454000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health"}, "56124564300": {"Name": "Ash S.", "AuthorID": "56124564300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.T.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health"}, "6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.J.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health"}, "35308260700": {"Name": "Welsh P.", "AuthorID": "35308260700", "AffiliationID": "60032768", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre"}, "7007043802": {"Name": "Sattar N.", "AuthorID": "7007043802", "AffiliationID": "60032768", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, BHF Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre"}, "7404437968": {"Name": "Lee I.M.", "AuthorID": "7404437968", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}}}
