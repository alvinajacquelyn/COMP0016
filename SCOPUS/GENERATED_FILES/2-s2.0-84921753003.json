Aim: To investigate the variation in GP treatment strategies for older patients with subclinical hypothyroidism depending on country and patient characteristics. Design and setting: Case-based survey of GPs in the Netherlands, Germany, England, Ireland, Switzerland, and New Zealand. Method: The treatment strategy of GPs (treatment yes/no, starting-dose thyroxine) was assessed for eight cases presenting a woman with subclinical hypothyroidism. The cases differed in the patient characteristics of age (70 versus 85 years), vitality status (vital versus vulnerable), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration (6 versus 15 mU/L). Results: A total of 526 GPs participated (the Netherlands n = 129, Germany n = 61, England n = 22, Ireland n = 21, Switzerland n = 262, New Zealand n = 31; overall response 19%). Across countries, differences in treatment strategy were observed. GPs from the Netherlands (mean treatment percentage 34%), England (40%), and New Zealand (39%) were less inclined to start treatment than GPs in Germany (73%), Ireland (62%), and Switzerland (52%) (P = 0.05). Overall, GPs were less inclined to start treatment in 85-year-old than in 70-year-old females (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.74 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.63 to 0.87]). Females with a TSH of 15 mU/L were more likely to get treated than those with a TSH of 6 mU/L (pooled OR 9.49 [95% CI = 5.81 to 15.5]). Conclusion: GP treatment strategies of older people with subclinical hypothyroidism vary largely by country and patient characteristics. This variation underlines the need for a new generation of international guidelines based on the outcomes of randomised clinical trials set within primary care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["General practice", "Subclinical hypothyroidism", "Survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Humans", "Hypothyroidism", "Male", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Thyrotropin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921753003", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"13907778000": {"Name": "Den Elzen W.P.J.", "AuthorID": "13907778000", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center, Department of Public Health and Primary Care"}, "56495433900": {"Name": "Lef\u00e8bre-Van De Fliert A.A.", "AuthorID": "56495433900", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center, Department of Public Health and Primary Care"}, "6602800094": {"Name": "De Waal M.W.M.", "AuthorID": "6602800094", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center, Department of Public Health and Primary Care"}, "7004091760": {"Name": "Gussekloo J.", "AuthorID": "7004091760", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden University Medical Center, Department of Public Health and Primary Care"}, "55208186800": {"Name": "Virgini V.", "AuthorID": "55208186800", "AffiliationID": "60020486, 60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Internal Medicine, Inselspital, University of Bern"}, "6506335496": {"Name": "Rodondi N.", "AuthorID": "6506335496", "AffiliationID": "60020486, 60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Internal Medicine, Inselspital, University of Bern"}, "56494302200": {"Name": "Frey P.", "AuthorID": "56494302200", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Bern Institute of General Practice, University of Bern"}, "7801636685": {"Name": "Mooijaart S.P.", "AuthorID": "7801636685", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "57195460711": {"Name": "Westendorp R.G.J.", "AuthorID": "57195460711", "AffiliationID": "107975390", "AffiliationName": "Leyden Academy on Vitality and Ageing"}, "56379730700": {"Name": "Kearney P.M.", "AuthorID": "56379730700", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College Cork"}, "36661055300": {"Name": "McCarthy V.J.C.", "AuthorID": "36661055300", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College Cork"}, "56493907100": {"Name": "Russell A.", "AuthorID": "56493907100", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College Cork"}, "6701834549": {"Name": "Kerse N.", "AuthorID": "6701834549", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Practice and Primary Health Care, University of Auckland"}, "8722893400": {"Name": "Mallen C.D.", "AuthorID": "8722893400", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Keele University"}, "7003389454": {"Name": "Muth C.", "AuthorID": "7003389454", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of General Practice, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University"}, "8309922800": {"Name": "Rosemann T.", "AuthorID": "8309922800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of General Practice and Health Services Research, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "6602189538": {"Name": "Schers H.", "AuthorID": "6602189538", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary and Community Care, Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen"}, "13309434700": {"Name": "Stott D.J.", "AuthorID": "13309434700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57213030915": {"Name": "Warner A.", "AuthorID": "57213030915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
