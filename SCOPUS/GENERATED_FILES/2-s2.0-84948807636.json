It has been linked to especially episodic memory decline and hippocampal atrophy in both healthy and demented elderly populations. In young adults, \u03b54 carriers have shown better performance in episodic memory compared to non-carriers. Spatial memory, however, has not been thoroughly assessed in relation to APOE in spite of its dependence on the hippocampus. In this study, we assessed the effect of APOE genotype on a variety of spatial and episodic memory tasks as well as hippocampal volume assessed through manual tracing in a sample of young adults (N= 123). We also assessed whether potential effects were modulated by sex. The presence of one or more \u03b54 alleles had positive effects on spatial function and memory and object location memory, but no effect on word recognition. Men were superior to women in spatial function and memory but there were no sex differences in the other tasks. In spite of APOE \u03b54 carriers having superior performance in several memory tasks, no difference was found as a function of APOE genotype in hippocampal volume. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that APOE \u03b54 has a positive effect on spatial ability in young adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["APOE \u03b54", "Episodic memory", "Hippocampus", "Manual tracing", "Spatial memory", "Young adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alleles", "Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Episodic", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Organ Size", "Sex Characteristics", "Spatial Memory", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948807636", "SubjectAreas": [["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56239665600": {"Name": "Stening E.", "AuthorID": "56239665600", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Uppsala University"}, "57212749964": {"Name": "Persson J.", "AuthorID": "57212749964", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Uppsala University"}, "56250424900": {"Name": "S\u00f6derlund H.", "AuthorID": "56250424900", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Uppsala University"}, "7203012179": {"Name": "Eriksson E.", "AuthorID": "7203012179", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Physiology and Neuroscience, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7006588606": {"Name": "Wahlund L.", "AuthorID": "7006588606", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Karolinska Institute"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
