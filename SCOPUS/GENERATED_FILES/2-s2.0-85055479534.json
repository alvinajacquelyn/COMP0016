From the initial observations of the illuminance footprint, it is found that the illumination overlap from each of the three colours is difficult to achieve a white light due to the physical layout of the emitting elements. We experimentally demonstrate that WDM is only achievable with a horizontal misalignment of +/-0.5 cm or +/-2 cm of the origin at a transmission span of 10 and 40 cm. Furthermore, with respect to the angular misalignment, WDM is achievable within a cone area of +5\u00b0 of the origin at 10 cm distance and only along the origin at a distance of 40 cm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["RGB LED", "visile light communications", "wavelength division multiplexing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angular misalignment", "Horizontal misalignments", "Physical layout", "RGB LED", "Visible light communications (VLC)", "White light"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055479534", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"35093759400": {"Name": "Burton A.", "AuthorID": "35093759400", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "OCRG, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "OCRG, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "25123131200": {"Name": "Minh H.L.", "AuthorID": "25123131200", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "OCRG, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
