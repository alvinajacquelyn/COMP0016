Human mutations in this pathway have been described in patients with holoprosencephaly (HPE), isolated congenital hypopituitarism (CH) and cranial/midline facial abnormalities. Mutations in Sonic hedgehog (SHH) have been associated with HPE but not CH, despite murine studies indicating involvement in pituitary development. Objectives/Methods We aimed to establish the role of the HH pathway in the aetiology of hypothalamo-pituitary disorders by screening our cohort of patients with midline defects and/or CH for mutations in SHH, GLI2, Shh brain enhancer 2 (SBE2) and growth-arrest specific 1 (GAS1). Results Two variants and a deletion of GLI2 were identified in three patients. A novel variant at a highly conserved residue in the zinc finger DNA-binding domain, c.1552G > A [pE518K], was identified in a patient with growth hormone deficiency and low normal free T4. A nonsynonymous variant, c.2159G > A [p.R720H], was identified in a patient with a short neck, cleft palate and hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. A 26\u00b76 Mb deletion, 2q12\u00b73-q21\u00b73, encompassing GLI2 and 77 other genes, was identified in a patient with short stature and impaired growth. Human embryonic expression studies and molecular characterisation of the GLI2 mutant p.E518K support the potential pathogenicity of GLI2 mutations. No mutations were identified in GAS1 or SBE2. A novel SHH variant, c.1295T>A [p.I432N], was identified in two siblings with variable midline defects but normal pituitary function. Conclusions Our data suggest that mutations in SHH, GAS1 and SBE2 are not associated with hypopituitarism, although GLI2 is an important candidate for CH.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Animals", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Female", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Variation", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Hedgehog Proteins", "Heterozygote", "Holoprosencephaly", "Humans", "Hypopituitarism", "Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors", "Male", "Mice", "Mutation", "NIH 3T3 Cells", "Nuclear Proteins", "Phenotype", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Signal Transduction", "Zinc Fingers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927087291", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"54079490600": {"Name": "Gregory L.C.", "AuthorID": "54079490600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease Section, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "34769323600": {"Name": "Webb E.A.", "AuthorID": "34769323600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease Section, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "37017580200": {"Name": "McCabe M.J.", "AuthorID": "37017580200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease Section, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57064396700": {"Name": "Panagiotakopoulos L.", "AuthorID": "57064396700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease Section, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease Section, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "8578913500": {"Name": "Gaston-Massuet C.", "AuthorID": "8578913500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "16308975600": {"Name": "Andoniadou C.L.", "AuthorID": "16308975600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Development and Stem Cell Biology Division, King College London"}, "55787719000": {"Name": "Carreno G.", "AuthorID": "55787719000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neural Developmental Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "6603565499": {"Name": "Martinez-Barbera J.P.", "AuthorID": "6603565499", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neural Developmental Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "15845870700": {"Name": "Kelberman D.", "AuthorID": "15845870700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Birth Defects Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7007078986": {"Name": "Saldanha J.W.", "AuthorID": "7007078986", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Division of Mathematical Biology, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "6603200582": {"Name": "Spoudeas H.A.", "AuthorID": "6603200582", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "8532227100": {"Name": "Torpiano J.", "AuthorID": "8532227100", "AffiliationID": "60121834", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Mater Dei Hospital"}, "55461391100": {"Name": "Rossi M.", "AuthorID": "55461391100", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Whittington Hospital"}, "7006281875": {"Name": "Raine J.", "AuthorID": "7006281875", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Whittington Hospital"}, "18933939100": {"Name": "Canham N.", "AuthorID": "18933939100", "AffiliationID": "60031535", "AffiliationName": "North West Thames Regional Genetics Service, Northwick Park Hospital"}}}
