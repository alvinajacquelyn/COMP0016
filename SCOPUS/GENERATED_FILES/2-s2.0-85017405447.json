Examination of the resulting patinas with colorimetry, SEM\u2013EDS, TEM, Raman spectroscopy and XRD revealed no systematic differences according to the fabrication method, whereas patina homogeneity and colour in those alloys that did not contain precious metal were affected by superficial work. Patina microstructure determines adherence and coverage, and depends upon the solution used irrespective of the alloy composition, but the colour of the patina is mainly related to the alloy composition. Gold promotes the development of cuprite, slowing the oxidation to tenorite in the corrosion process. Gold additions produce a more uniform patina as well as a desirable blue\u2013black tone, which is likely to have been a factor in alloy selection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["artificial patination", "black bronze alloys", "colour", "experimental replication", "gold"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017405447", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57193891190": {"Name": "Benzonelli A.", "AuthorID": "57193891190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "6603120018": {"Name": "Freestone I.C.", "AuthorID": "6603120018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "15026923300": {"Name": "Martin\u00f3n-Torres M.", "AuthorID": "15026923300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
