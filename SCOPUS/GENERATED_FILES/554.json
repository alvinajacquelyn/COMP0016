Here we demonstrate that the AlkL protein from Pseudomonas putida GPo1 is an alkane import protein capable of industrially relevant rates of uptake of C 7 -C 16 n-alkanes. Without alkL expression, native E.coli n-alkane uptake was the rate-limiting step in both the whole-cell bioconversion of C 7 -C 16 n-alkanes and in the activation of a whole-cell alkane biosensor by C 10 and C 11 alkanes. By coexpression of alkL as a transporter plug-in, specific yields improved by up to 100-fold for bioxidation of >C 12 alkanes to fatty alcohols and acids. The alkL protein was shown to be toxic to the host when overexpressed but when expressed from a vector capable of controlled induction, yields of alkane oxidation were improved a further 10-fold (8\u00e2 \u20ac...g/L and 1.7\u00e2 \u20ac...g/g of total oxidized products). Further testing of activity on n-octane with the controlled expression vector revealed the highest reported rates of 120\u00e2 \u20ac...1/4mol/min/g and 1\u00e2 \u20ac...g/L/h total oxidized products. This is the first time AlkL has been shown to directly facilitate enhanced uptake of C 10 -C 16 alkanes and represents the highest reported gain in product yields resulting from its use.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkanes", "Bacterial Proteins", "Biocatalysis", "Biological Transport", "Biosensing Techniques", "Carrier Proteins", "Escherichia coli", "Fatty Acids", "Fatty Alcohols", "Gene Expression", "Genetic Vectors", "Metabolic Engineering", "Models, Molecular", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Pseudomonas putida", "Transgenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84905234266", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57006101600": {"Name": "Grant C.", "AuthorID": "57006101600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56303131500": {"Name": "Deszcz D.", "AuthorID": "56303131500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56303371600": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "56303371600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56303240400": {"Name": "Folliard T.", "AuthorID": "56303240400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56303799600": {"Name": "Sreenivasan R.", "AuthorID": "56303799600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Structural and Molecular Biology, ISMB, University College London"}, "6701589883": {"Name": "Dalby P.", "AuthorID": "6701589883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603502108": {"Name": "Baganz F.", "AuthorID": "6603502108", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "23111047200": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Torres R.", "AuthorID": "23111047200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Structural and Molecular Biology, ISMB, University College London"}, "36605035900": {"Name": "Morris P.", "AuthorID": "36605035900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Structural and Molecular Biology, ISMB, University College London"}, "7006424399": {"Name": "Woodley J.", "AuthorID": "7006424399", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Technical University of Denmark"}}}
