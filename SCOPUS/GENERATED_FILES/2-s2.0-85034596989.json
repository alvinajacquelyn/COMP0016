Participants were given 12 virtual shares of financial assets and asked to use price graphs and news items to maximize their returns by buying, selling, or holding each one. In making their decisions, they were influenced by properties of both news items and price series but they relied more on the former. Western participants had lower trading latencies and lower return dispersions than Eastern participants. Those with greater openness to experience had lower trading latencies. Participants bought more shares when they forecast that prices would rise but failed to sell more when they forecast that they would fall. These findings are all consistent with the view that people trading assets try to make sense of information by incorporating it within a coherent narrative.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Culture", "Forecasts", "Personality", "Price trends", "Trading"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034596989", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57164620300": {"Name": "Sobolev D.", "AuthorID": "57164620300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}, "57197760514": {"Name": "Chan B.", "AuthorID": "57197760514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57206194829": {"Name": "Harvey N.", "AuthorID": "57206194829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
