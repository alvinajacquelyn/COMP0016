Care and outcomes are improving through organisational initiatives and updated clinical practice guidelines based on clinical research mainly carried out by large collaborative networks. This progress is likely to continue through the collaborative work of the established and merging trials groups in many parts of the world and through refined trial methodology and translational work. In this review, international experts summarize the current position of clinical research in septic shock and propose a research agenda to advance this field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical research", "Critical care", "ICU", "Intensive care", "Randomized trials", "Sepsis", "Septic shock"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Infective Agents", "Biomedical Research", "Critical Care", "Fluid Therapy", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Quality of Life", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Shock, Septic", "Standard of Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019236222", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"6701591799": {"Name": "Perner A.", "AuthorID": "6701591799", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "57206874913": {"Name": "Gordon A.C.", "AuthorID": "57206874913", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section of Anaesthetics, Pain Medicine and Intensive Care, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7102124583": {"Name": "Angus D.C.", "AuthorID": "7102124583", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "15829826700": {"Name": "Lamontagne F.", "AuthorID": "15829826700", "AffiliationID": "60004772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine et des sciences de la sant\u00e9, Centre de recherche du CHU de Sherbrooke, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}, "35557329300": {"Name": "Machado F.", "AuthorID": "35557329300", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "7404208893": {"Name": "Russell J.A.", "AuthorID": "7404208893", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60085845, 60015670", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Heart Lung Innovation, St. Paul\u2019s Hospital, University of British Columbia"}, "36741548300": {"Name": "Timsit J.F.", "AuthorID": "36741548300", "AffiliationID": "60022785, 60123796, 60123665, 60000905, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "APHP Medical and Infectious Diseases ICU Bichat University Hospital, UMR 1137 IAME, Inserm/University Paris-Diderot"}, "18536499900": {"Name": "Marshall J.C.", "AuthorID": "18536499900", "AffiliationID": "60085802, 60016849, 60017018", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Surgery and Critical Care Medicine, The Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science, St. Michael\u2019s Hospital, University of Toronto"}, "7005265296": {"Name": "Myburgh J.", "AuthorID": "7005265296", "AffiliationID": "60011463, 60028333, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "The George Institute for Global Health, Sydney, St George Clinical School, University of New South Wales"}, "35365083600": {"Name": "Shankar-Hari M.", "AuthorID": "35365083600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guys and St Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, Department of Immunobiology, Kings College London"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London"}}}
