These rivers\u2019 existence is a challenge to models of planetary climate evolution. We report results indicating that, for a given catchment area, rivers on Mars were wider than rivers on Earth today. We use the scale (width and wavelength) of Mars paleo-rivers as a proxy for past runoff production. Using multiple methods, we infer that intense runoff production of >(3\u201320) kg/m 2 per day persisted until <3 billion years (Ga) ago and probably <1 Ga ago, and was globally distributed. Therefore, the intense runoff production inferred from the results of the Mars Science Laboratory rover was not a short-lived or local anomaly. Rather, precipitation-fed runoff production was globally distributed, was intense, and persisted intermittently over >1 Ga. Our improved history of Mars\u2019 river runoff places new constraints on the unknown mechanism that caused wet climates on Mars.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catchment area", "Mars science laboratory", "Multiple methods", "Planetary climate", "River runoffs", "Runoff production"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061188064", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"23090619000": {"Name": "Kite E.S.", "AuthorID": "23090619000", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "University of Chicago"}, "57192307639": {"Name": "Mayer D.P.", "AuthorID": "57192307639", "AffiliationID": "60011347", "AffiliationName": "United States Geologic Survey, Astrogeology Science Center"}, "57208176588": {"Name": "de Quay G.S.", "AuthorID": "57208176588", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences, University of Texas at Austin"}, "35235702700": {"Name": "Wilson S.A.", "AuthorID": "35235702700", "AffiliationID": "60007670, 60015033", "AffiliationName": "Center for Earth and Planetary Studies, Smithsonian Institution"}, "57207171088": {"Name": "Davis J.M.", "AuthorID": "57207171088", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Natural History Museum"}, "17135301400": {"Name": "Lucas A.S.", "AuthorID": "17135301400", "AffiliationID": "60001970", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Centre National de la Recherche Scien-tifique"}}}
