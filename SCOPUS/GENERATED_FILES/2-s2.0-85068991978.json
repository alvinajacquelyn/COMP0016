Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether scar heterogeneity, quantified by mean entropy, predicts appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy. We hypothesized that higher mean entropy calculated from cardiac magnetic resonance texture analysis (CMR-TA) will predict appropriate ICD therapy. Methods: Consecutive patients underwent CMR imaging before ICD implantation. Short-axis left ventricular scar was manually segmented. CMR-TA was performed using a Laplacian filter to extract and augment image features to create a scar texture from which histogram analysis of pixel intensity was used to calculate mean entropy. The primary end point was appropriate ICD therapy. Results: A total of 114 patients underwent CMR-TA (ischemic cardiomyopathy [ICM]: n = 70; nonischemic cardiomyopathy [NICM]: n = 44) with a median follow-up of 955 days (interquartile range 691\u20131185 days). Mean entropy was significantly higher in the ICM group (5.7 \u00b1 0.7 vs 5.5 \u00b1 0.7; P=.045). Overall, 33 patients received appropriate ICD therapy. Using optimized cutoff values from receiver operating characteristic curves, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated time until first appropriate therapy was significantly shorter in the high mean entropy group (P =.003). Multivariable analysis showed that mean entropy was the sole predictor of appropriate ICD therapy (hazard ratio 1.882; 95% confidence interval 1.083\u20133.271; P =.025). In the ICM group, mean entropy remained an independent predictor of appropriate ICD therapy, whereas in the NICM group, precontrast T1 values were the sole predictor. Conclusion: Scar heterogeneity, quantified by mean entropy using CMR-TA, was an independent predictor of appropriate ICD therapy in the mixed cardiomyopathy cohort and ICM-only group, suggesting a potential role for CMR-TA in predicting ventricular arrhythmia and risk-stratifying patients for ICD implantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Entropy", "Late gadolinium enhancement", "Risk stratification of ventricular arrhythmia", "Scar heterogeneity", "Ventricular arrhythmia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiomyopathies", "Cicatrix", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Entropy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Tachycardia, Ventricular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068991978", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57194686865": {"Name": "Gould J.", "AuthorID": "57194686865", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57192436471": {"Name": "Porter B.", "AuthorID": "57192436471", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "37107296200": {"Name": "Claridge S.", "AuthorID": "37107296200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "55626526700": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "55626526700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57193110465": {"Name": "Sieniewicz B.J.", "AuthorID": "57193110465", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57200621668": {"Name": "Sidhu B.S.", "AuthorID": "57200621668", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "6603307945": {"Name": "Carr-White G.", "AuthorID": "6603307945", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57197702550": {"Name": "Razavi R.", "AuthorID": "57197702550", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "22984044200": {"Name": "Chiribiri A.", "AuthorID": "22984044200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57217533072": {"Name": "Rinaldi C.A.", "AuthorID": "57217533072", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "6507804465": {"Name": "Niederer S.", "AuthorID": "6507804465", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "26664065700": {"Name": "Bishop M.J.", "AuthorID": "26664065700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "7003946169": {"Name": "Murgatroyd F.", "AuthorID": "7003946169", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8556612100": {"Name": "Ganeshan B.", "AuthorID": "8556612100", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}}}
