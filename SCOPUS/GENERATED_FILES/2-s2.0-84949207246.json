This leads to a possible new, low energy pathway for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate and syngas at low overpotentials, utilizing this reactive ionic liquid media. Herein, an electrochemical investigation of water and carbon dioxide addition to the [P66614][124Triz] on gold and platinum working electrodes is reported. Electrolysis measurements have been performed using CO2 saturated [P66614][124Triz] based solutions at -0.9 V and -1.9 V on gold and platinum electrodes. The effects of the electrode material on the formation of formate and syngas using these solutions are presented and discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949207246", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"14829077900": {"Name": "Hollingsworth N.", "AuthorID": "14829077900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005668268": {"Name": "Holt K.", "AuthorID": "7005668268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "De Leeuw N.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "55462787600": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "55462787600", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University Belfast"}, "8434058100": {"Name": "Jacquemin J.", "AuthorID": "8434058100", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University Belfast"}, "56243169300": {"Name": "Hardacre C.", "AuthorID": "56243169300", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Queen's University Belfast"}, "56992748100": {"Name": "Galante M.", "AuthorID": "56992748100", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas-UNICAMP"}, "7006536875": {"Name": "Longo C.", "AuthorID": "7006536875", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Campinas-UNICAMP"}}}
