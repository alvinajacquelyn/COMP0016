The anode material has a partially graphitic structure and nanotube morphology, which ensure stable cycling, Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99% as well as remarkable rate-capability in lithium half-cell, and suggest the compatibility for full-cell application. The performance of each lithium-ion array appears strongly related to the different structural, morphological and electrochemical features of the positive electrodes. The study in full-cell of the MWCNTs anode, to date mostly investigated in lithium half-cell, is therefore performed under various conditions. The MWCNTs/Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O2 combination reveals promising behavior in terms of cycling stability, reversible capacity and Coulombic efficiency, which well demonstrates the potential suitability of MWCNTs as anodes in lithium-ion cell.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Li-ion battery", "LiCoO2", "LiFe1/4Mn1/2Co1/4PO4", "Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O2", "Multiwalled carbon nanotubes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coulombic efficiency", "Electrochemical features", "Graphitic structures", "LiCoO2", "LiFe1/4Mn1/2Co1/4PO4", "Multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs)", "Nanotube morphology", "Positive electrodes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043268006", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"56416532600": {"Name": "Di Lecce D.", "AuthorID": "56416532600", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "57201059720": {"Name": "Andreotti P.", "AuthorID": "57201059720", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "57218331983": {"Name": "Boni M.", "AuthorID": "57218331983", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "57201058615": {"Name": "Gasparro G.", "AuthorID": "57201058615", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "57201059149": {"Name": "Rizzati G.", "AuthorID": "57201059149", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "7102421480": {"Name": "Hassoun J.", "AuthorID": "7102421480", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "56297975400": {"Name": "Hwang J.Y.", "AuthorID": "56297975400", "AffiliationID": "60024872", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy Engineering, Hanyang University"}, "55551960800": {"Name": "Sun Y.K.", "AuthorID": "55551960800", "AffiliationID": "60024872", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy Engineering, Hanyang University"}}}
