Our approach takes advantage of the unique self-assembling properties of polyamidoamine dendrimers with gold nanoparticles in aqueous media to create one-dimensional nanochains, with a distinct red to blue colour change, attributable to a longitudinal plasmon resonance, which can be readily detected by eye and a digital camera. We optimise and characterise nanochain formation and stability using UV-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. As a proof-of-principle we focus on the application of nanochains for point-of-care diagnostics for p24, an important biomarker of early HIV infections and successfully detect p24 with a limit of detection of 5 ng ml-1 in pseudo-serum, 4 fold more sensitive than comparable studies with gold nanoparticles. These findings and underlying concepts highlight the potential of advanced functional organic-inorganic composite nanomaterials to diagnose infections, with broad applicability to non-communicable diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029520048", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"35975400700": {"Name": "Ruiz-Sanchez A.J.", "AuthorID": "35975400700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "36444108100": {"Name": "Parolo C.", "AuthorID": "36444108100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "57195275473": {"Name": "Miller B.S.", "AuthorID": "57195275473", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "36730986800": {"Name": "Gray E.R.", "AuthorID": "36730986800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "57195679278": {"Name": "Schlegel K.", "AuthorID": "57195679278", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006090296": {"Name": "McKendry R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006090296", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine, University College London (UCL)"}}}
