Low background, ground-based cryogenic facilities are required for the cryogenic testing of materials, components and subsystems. The University of Lethbridge Test Facility Cryostat (TFC) is a large volume, closed cycle, 4 K cryogenic facility, developed for this purpose. This paper discusses the design and performance of the facility and associated metrology instrumentation, both internal and external to the TFC. Additionally, an apparatus for measuring the thermal and mechanical properties of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer", "Cryogenics", "Cryostat design", "Far infrared astronomy", "Material characterization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Astronomical spectroscopy", "Carbon fiber reinforced polymer", "Cryogenic facilities", "Cryogenic test facility", "Far-infrared astronomies", "Material characterizations", "Space-borne instruments", "Thermal and mechanical properties"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991296011", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56548978500": {"Name": "Veenendaal I.", "AuthorID": "56548978500", "AffiliationID": "60024776", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Instrumentation Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Lethbridge"}, "7101662378": {"Name": "Naylor D.", "AuthorID": "7101662378", "AffiliationID": "60024776", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Instrumentation Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Lethbridge"}, "6603276352": {"Name": "Gom B.", "AuthorID": "6603276352", "AffiliationID": "60024776", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Instrumentation Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Lethbridge"}, "57191530890": {"Name": "Gunuganti S.", "AuthorID": "57191530890", "AffiliationID": "60111980", "AffiliationName": "Blue Sky Spectroscopy"}, "7202992877": {"Name": "Winter C.", "AuthorID": "7202992877", "AffiliationID": "60090244", "AffiliationName": "Quantum Technology Corp - Canada"}, "56677095800": {"Name": "Jones M.", "AuthorID": "56677095800", "AffiliationID": "60104726", "AffiliationName": "Glyndwr University"}, "7404441122": {"Name": "Walker D.", "AuthorID": "7404441122", "AffiliationID": "60104726", "AffiliationName": "Glyndwr University"}}}
