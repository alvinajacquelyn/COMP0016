Blood contacting surfaces maintain their patency through physico-chemical properties of a functional endothelium. A poly(carbonate-urea) urethane (PCU) is used as a base material to examine the feasibility of L-Arginine methyl ester (L-AME) functionalized material for use in implants and coatings. The study hypothesizes that L-AME, incorporated into PCU, functions as a bioactive porogen, releasing upon contact with blood to interact with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) present in blood. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) were successfully cultured on L-AME functionalized material, indicating that L-AME-increases cell viability. L-AME functionalized material potentially has broad applications in blood-contacting medical devices, as well as various other applications requiring endogenous up-regulation of nitric oxide, such as wound healing. This study presents an in-vitro investigation to demonstrate the novel anti-thrombogenic properties of L-AME, when in solution and when present within a polyurethane-based polymer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974625128", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56439167900": {"Name": "Everett W.", "AuthorID": "56439167900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "57189687345": {"Name": "Rammou A.", "AuthorID": "57189687345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "35733502300": {"Name": "Darbyshire A.", "AuthorID": "35733502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "25635358300": {"Name": "De Mel A.", "AuthorID": "25635358300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, University College London"}, "8426889000": {"Name": "Scurr D.J.", "AuthorID": "8426889000", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Interface and Surface Analysis Centre, University of Nottingham"}, "57203105158": {"Name": "Hamilton G.", "AuthorID": "57203105158", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hampstead, NHS Trust Hospital"}}}
