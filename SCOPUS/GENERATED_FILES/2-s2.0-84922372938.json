Using a combination of analytical and numerical results, we suggest that different types of theory should be detectable using the predicted anomalous tidal stresses effects around the saddle points of the Newtonian gravitational field. The saddle point bubbles' expected extent of \u223c400 km are to be contrasted with potential miss parameters of \u226410 km, making such a test in easy reach of LPF. We also consider routes to constraining our theories from data, based on scenarios of both null and positive results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Gravitational fields", "Gravity theory", "LISA Pathfinder", "Newtonian dynamics", "Numerical results", "Saddle point", "Scale theory", "Tidal stress"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922372938", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55540076200": {"Name": "Mozaffari A.", "AuthorID": "55540076200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College"}}}
