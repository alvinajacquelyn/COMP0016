Patients and Methods A linkage study between the National Joint Registry, Hospital Episodes Statistics and records of the Office for National Statistics on deaths was undertaken. Patients who underwent elective total hip arthroplasty between January 2003 and December 2014 with no past history of cardiac failure were included and stratified as having either a MoM (n = 53 529) or a non- MoM (n = 482 247) arthroplasty. The primary outcome measure was the time to an admission to hospital for cardiac failure or death. Analysis was carried out using data from all patients and from those matched by propensity score. Results The risk of cardiac failure was lower in the MoM cohort compared with the non-MoM cohort (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.901; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.853 to 0.953). The risk of cardiac failure was similar following matching (aHR 0.909; 95% CI 0.838 to 0.987) and the findings were consistent in subgroup analysis. Conclusion The risk of cardiac failure following total hip arthroplasty was not increased in those in whom MoM implants were used, compared with those in whom other types of prostheses were used, in the first seven years after surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Hip Prosthesis", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Male", "Medical Record Linkage", "Metal-on-Metal Joint Prostheses", "Middle Aged", "Prosthesis Design", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040347121", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"26640768800": {"Name": "Sabah S.A.", "AuthorID": "26640768800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore, Middlesex, University College London"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London, Barts Heart Centre"}, "37017095000": {"Name": "Jenkins-Jones S.", "AuthorID": "37017095000", "AffiliationID": "118586492", "AffiliationName": "Global Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Pharmatelligence"}, "57217476126": {"Name": "Morgan C.L.", "AuthorID": "57217476126", "AffiliationID": "118586492", "AffiliationName": "Global Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Pharmatelligence"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "35236774800": {"Name": "Currie C.J.", "AuthorID": "35236774800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Medicine, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "35585820200": {"Name": "Wilkinson J.M.", "AuthorID": "35585820200", "AffiliationID": "120065631", "AffiliationName": "National Joint Registry for England"}, "7201468246": {"Name": "Porter M.", "AuthorID": "7201468246", "AffiliationID": "60032340", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Hip Surgery, Wrightington Hospital"}, "6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Lifelong Health and Ageing Unit, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "24445178000": {"Name": "Kay P.", "AuthorID": "24445178000", "AffiliationID": "60032340", "AffiliationName": "Wrightington Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57217429150": {"Name": "Hart A.H.", "AuthorID": "57217429150", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
