Debates concerned with the public understanding of science and the \u2018science wars\u2019, both of which relied to some extent on the dividing of society into \u2018two cultures\u2019, are contextualised within longer efforts by scientists to popularise definitions of science and society and their relationship with other epistemic communities. This paper argues that we should think about all these episodes as part of ongoing rhetorical boundary work, reflective of strains and stressors on science as an institution. The two cultures debate has provided one powerful rhetorical device, amongst many, for ongoing boundary work to establish or question science as the dominant form of knowledge in society and delineate who is allowed to speak for it, and wield its power.", "AuthorKeywords": ["boundary work", "popular science", "popularisation", "public understanding of science", "science communication", "science wars"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary works", "popular science", "popularisation", "Public understanding of science", "Science communications", "science wars"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002398026", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57201294621": {"Name": "Lock S.J.", "AuthorID": "57201294621", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, UCL"}}}
