Methods: The participants were divided into two groups of 35 patients each. There were 28 men and seven women with a mean age of 46 years in the control group and 26 men and nine women with a mean age of 47 years in the rupture group. The lateral knee radiograph of each patient was evaluated for Insall-Salvati ratio for patella alta, increased density of the infrapatellar fat pad, appearance of the soft tissue margin of the patellar tendon and bony avulsions. Results: In the rupture group there were three consistent soft tissue radiographic features in addition to patellar alta. These were increased density of infrapatellar fat pad; loss of sharp, well-defined linear margins of the patellar tendon and angulated wavy margin of the patellar tendon while in the control group these features were not observed. Conclusions: The soft tissue radiographic features described in the rupture group are consistent and reliable. When coupled with careful clinical assessment, these will aid in early diagnosis and further imaging will be seldom required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis", "Infrapatellar fat pad", "Patellar tendon rupture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adipose Tissue", "Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Knee Injuries", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patella", "Radiography", "Retrospective Studies", "Rupture", "Tendon Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949202913", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"15049356800": {"Name": "Fazal M.A.", "AuthorID": "15049356800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "8952207100": {"Name": "Moonot P.", "AuthorID": "8952207100", "AffiliationID": "100804695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Apollo Hospital"}}}
