We examined whether childhood experiences of poor-quality parenting are associated with an increased risk of cancer at older ages. Methods: We used a sample of 4471 community dwellers aged \u2265 55 years in 2007. Poor-quality parenting was defined as low levels of parental care and high levels of parental overprotection. Results: Overall poorer experiences of parenting, decreasing parental care and increasing parental overprotection were associated with increased risk of incident all-site and skin cancer in men, but not in women. Increasing paternal overprotection was also associated with increased risk of incident colorectal cancer in men. Overall poorer experiences of parenting and increasing paternal overprotection were associated with increased risk of prevalent all-site and colorectal cancer in women. Adjustment for covariates explained a small part of these associations. Conclusions: Older adults who reported childhood experiences of poorer quality parenting appear to have an increased risk of cancer. These findings improve our understanding of the role of psychosocial factors in cancer over the life course.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Cancer", "Childhood", "Cohort", "Life course", "Parenting", "Stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["England", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Incidence", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Parenting", "Prevalence", "Risk", "Sex Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048514591", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6505997583": {"Name": "Demakakos P.", "AuthorID": "6505997583", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003487025": {"Name": "Biddulph J.", "AuthorID": "7003487025", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "36051235900": {"Name": "Chrousos G.", "AuthorID": "36051235900", "AffiliationID": "60028900, 60021061", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens Medical School, Aghia Sophia Children\u2019s Hospital"}}}
