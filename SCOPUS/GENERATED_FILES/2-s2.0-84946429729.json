We initially investigated the close interplay between Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and the F-actin network. We show that, during the early stage of cell adhesion, PIP2 forms domains within the filopodia membrane. We studied these domains alongside cell spreading and observed that these very closely follow the actin tread-milling. We show that this mechanism is associated with an active transport of PIP2 rich organelles from the cell perinuclear area to the edge, along actin fibers. Finally, mapping other phospholipids and membrane components we observed that the PIP2 domains formation is correlated with sphingosine and cholesterol rafts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3T3 Cells", "Actin Cytoskeleton", "Actin-Related Protein 2-3 Complex", "Actins", "Animals", "Biological Transport, Active", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Line", "Cell Membrane", "Cell Movement", "Cholesterol", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Mice", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Protein Transport", "Sphingosine", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946429729", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55427992100": {"Name": "Chierico L.", "AuthorID": "55427992100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UCL Centre for Molecular and Medical Virology, University College London"}, "56580541700": {"Name": "Joseph A.", "AuthorID": "56580541700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UCL Centre for Molecular and Medical Virology, University College London"}, "57204254218": {"Name": "Battaglia G.", "AuthorID": "57204254218", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UCL Centre for Molecular and Medical Virology, University College London"}, "35305215700": {"Name": "Lewis A.", "AuthorID": "35305215700", "AffiliationID": "60099536", "AffiliationName": "Biocompatibles UK Ltd., Farnham Business Park"}}}
