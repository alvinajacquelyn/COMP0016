The field has received a powerful boost with the development of the technique into super-resolution imaging methods, ca. 10 years ago, which overcome the limitations imposed by optical diffraction. Today, single molecule super-resolution imaging is routinely used in the study of macromolecular function and structure in the cell. Concomitantly, computational methods have been developed that provide information on numbers and positions of molecules at the nanometer-scale. In this overview, we outline the technical developments that have led to the emergence of localization microscopy techniques from single-molecule spectroscopy. We then provide a comprehensive review on the application of the technique in the field of neuroscience research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioimaging", "Neurodegeneration", "Neuroscience", "Protein misfolding and aggregation", "Single-molecule localization microscopy", "Super-resolution microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fluorescent Dyes", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Macromolecular Substances", "Microscopy", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Molecular Imaging", "Nanotechnology", "Neurons", "Optical Imaging", "Spectrum Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010325996", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"56545241500": {"Name": "Laine R.", "AuthorID": "56545241500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Laser Analytics Group, Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Cambridge University"}, "6603449657": {"Name": "Schierle G.", "AuthorID": "6603449657", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Laser Analytics Group, Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Cambridge University"}, "7003673210": {"Name": "Kaminski C.", "AuthorID": "7003673210", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Laser Analytics Group, Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Cambridge University"}, "23006738100": {"Name": "Van De Linde S.", "AuthorID": "23006738100", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biophysics, Julius-Maximilians-University"}}}
