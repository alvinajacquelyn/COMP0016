We probed them for a liver-resident subset, distinct from conventional bone-marrow-derived NK. CXCR6+ NK were strikingly enriched in healthy and diseased liver compared to blood (p < 0.0001). Human hepatic CXCR6+ NK had an immature phenotype (predominantly CD56 bright CD16CD57), and expressed the tissue-residency marker CD69. CXCR6+ NK produced fewer cytotoxic mediators and pro-inflammatory cytokines than the non-liver-specific CXCR6 fraction. Instead CXCR6+ NK could upregulate TRAIL, a key death ligand in hepatitis pathogenesis. CXCR6 demarcated liver NK into two transcriptionally distinct populations: T-bet hi Eomes lo (CXCR6) and T-bet lo Eomes hi (CXCR6+); the latter was virtually absent in the periphery. The small circulating CXCR6+ subset was predominantly T-bet hi Eomes lo, suggesting its lineage was closer to CXCR6 peripheral than CXCR6+ liver NK. These data reveal a large subset of human liver-resident T-bet lo Eomes hi NK, distinguished by their surface expression of CXCR6, adapted for hepatic tolerance and inducible anti-viral immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Cytokines", "Female", "Humans", "Immunophenotyping", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Liver", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Receptors, CXCR6", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971215861", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"25959301500": {"Name": "Stegmann K.A.", "AuthorID": "25959301500", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "37097765300": {"Name": "Pallant C.", "AuthorID": "37097765300", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "57219796274": {"Name": "Christophides T.", "AuthorID": "57219796274", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "55613142700": {"Name": "Pallett L.J.", "AuthorID": "55613142700", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "24171517900": {"Name": "Peppa D.", "AuthorID": "24171517900", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "7201438281": {"Name": "Dunn C.", "AuthorID": "7201438281", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "24405746300": {"Name": "Male V.", "AuthorID": "24405746300", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "7003333032": {"Name": "Maini M.K.", "AuthorID": "7003333032", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "56730197200": {"Name": "Robertson F.", "AuthorID": "56730197200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL, Royal Free Hospital London"}, "25629557900": {"Name": "Fusai G.", "AuthorID": "25629557900", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL, Royal Free Hospital London"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL, Royal Free Hospital London"}, "13906759700": {"Name": "Hansi N.", "AuthorID": "13906759700", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Bart's and London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "55934460700": {"Name": "Gill U.", "AuthorID": "55934460700", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Bart's and London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57196075608": {"Name": "Kennedy P.", "AuthorID": "57196075608", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digestive Diseases, Blizard Institute, Bart's and London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}}}
