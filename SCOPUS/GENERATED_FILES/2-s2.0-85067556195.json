We make assumptions on the equation of state and the initial data that are relativistic analogs of the well-known physical vacuum boundary condition, which has played an important role in prior work on the non-relativistic compressible Euler equations. Our main result is the derivation, relative to Lagrangian (also known as co-moving) coordinates, of local-in-time a priori estimates for the solution. The solution features a fluid-vacuum boundary, transported by the fluid four-velocity, along which the hyperbolicity of the equations degenerates. In this context, the relativistic Euler equations are equivalent to a degenerate quasilinear hyperbolic wave-map-like system that cannot be treated using standard energy methods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067556195", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"23491961000": {"Name": "Had\u017ei\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "23491961000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, King\u2019s College London"}, "7003600063": {"Name": "Shkoller S.", "AuthorID": "7003600063", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of California at Davis"}, "32667968900": {"Name": "Speck J.", "AuthorID": "32667968900", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
