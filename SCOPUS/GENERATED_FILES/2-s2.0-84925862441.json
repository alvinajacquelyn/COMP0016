It is primarily a disease of the desmosome, with mutations in desmosomal protein genes identified in approximately 50% of affected individuals. Mutations result in fibrofatty replacement of cardiomyocytes, aneurysm formation and dilatation of the right and often the left ventricle. The clinical diagnosis of ARVC is based upon complex criteria that consider pathology, genetics and clinical presentation. This review describes the application of the revised criteria for ARVC in everyday practice and illustrates the requirement for continued modification to improve their sensitivity and specificity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arrhythmias", "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia", "Diagnosis", "Echocardiography", "Electrocardiography", "Genetics", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Sudden cardiac death"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925862441", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"26428573900": {"Name": "Wicks E.C.", "AuthorID": "26428573900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7202244843": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "7202244843", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
