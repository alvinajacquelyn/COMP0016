All rights reserved.Parkinson's disease (PD) involves motor symptoms reflecting the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, diagnosis is only enabled late in the disease, limiting treatment to palliative assistance. Here, we review recently generated transcriptional profiling datasets from blood and brain RNA of human PD cohorts and animal models that may offer unprecedented progress in PD research. Specifically, advanced analysis techniques demonstrated functionally inter-related underlying impairments of RNA metabolism and neuroimmune signalling processes. Identifying novel biomarkers in serum and nucleated blood cells, including protein networks and non-coding RNAs can drive discovery of the molecular mechanisms involved and reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention, posing a dual diagnosis/treatment opportunity for limiting the exacerbation of neuroinflammatory events in PD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Leukocytes", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Parkinson Disease", "Sequence Analysis, RNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947556247", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"56088505200": {"Name": "Simchovitz A.", "AuthorID": "56088505200", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Chemistry, Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "35464534500": {"Name": "Soreq H.", "AuthorID": "35464534500", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Chemistry, Edmond and Lily Safra Center for Brain Sciences, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "13612054300": {"Name": "Soreq L.", "AuthorID": "13612054300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology (ION)"}}}
