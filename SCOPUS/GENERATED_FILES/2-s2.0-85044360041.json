While domesticated animals can play central roles in major spill-over events of zoonotic bat-borne viruses, for example during the pig-amplified Malaysian Nipah virus outbreak of 1998-1999, the extent of their potential to act as bridging or amplifying species for these viruses has not been characterised systematically. This review aims to compile current knowledge on the role of domesticated animals as hosts of two types of bat-borne viruses, henipaviruses and filoviruses. A systematic literature search of these virus-host interactions in domesticated animals identified 72 relevant studies, which were categorised by year, location, design and type of evidence generated. The review then focusses on Africa as a case study, comparing research efforts in domesticated animals and bats with the distributions of documented human cases. Major gaps remain in our knowledge of the potential ability of domesticated animals to contract or spread these zoonoses. Closing these gaps will be necessary to fully evaluate and mitigate spill-over risks of these viruses, especially with global agricultural intensification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bat-borne viruses", "Domesticated animals", "Emerging zoonotic viruses", "Filoviruses", "Henipaviruses"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa", "Animals", "Animals, Domestic", "Chiroptera", "Disease Reservoirs", "Filoviridae", "Filoviridae Infections", "Henipavirus", "Henipavirus Infections", "Humans", "Zoonoses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044360041", "SubjectAreas": [["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"57195933315": {"Name": "Glennon E.", "AuthorID": "57195933315", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "13606349100": {"Name": "Restif O.", "AuthorID": "13606349100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57201449074": {"Name": "Sbarbaro S.", "AuthorID": "57201449074", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "55175098600": {"Name": "Garnier R.", "AuthorID": "55175098600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "7404353992": {"Name": "Wood J.", "AuthorID": "7404353992", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "24377187500": {"Name": "Suu-Ire R.", "AuthorID": "24377187500", "AffiliationID": "120485771", "AffiliationName": "Accra National Zoo"}, "8721186900": {"Name": "Osei-Amponsah R.", "AuthorID": "8721186900", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Science, University of Ghana"}, "35559421700": {"Name": "Peel A.", "AuthorID": "35559421700", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Futures Research Institute, Griffith University"}}}
