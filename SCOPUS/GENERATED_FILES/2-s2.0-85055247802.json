P. fulva was isolated from blood of a 45 years male admitted in surgical ICU. Isolate was identified by the MALDI-TOF-MS and was extensively drug resistant (XDR) strain. Isolate was found negative for metallo \u03b2 lactamase (MBL) and extended spectrum \u03b2 lactamase (ESBL) types by phenotypic and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. It was concluded that P. fulva is an emerging opportunistic pathogen.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacteremia", "Pseudomonas fulva", "XDR"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055247802", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57204353473": {"Name": "Uddin F.", "AuthorID": "57204353473", "AffiliationID": "60061893", "AffiliationName": "University of Karachi"}, "56385041500": {"Name": "Khan T.A.", "AuthorID": "56385041500", "AffiliationID": "60061893", "AffiliationName": "University of Karachi"}, "35345624800": {"Name": "Sohail M.", "AuthorID": "35345624800", "AffiliationID": "60061893", "AffiliationName": "University of Karachi"}, "57200589473": {"Name": "Roulston K.", "AuthorID": "57200589473", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "McHugh T.D.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}}}
