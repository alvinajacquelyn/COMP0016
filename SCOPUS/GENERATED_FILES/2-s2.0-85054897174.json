Females of the social wasp Polistes dominula produce substrate-borne vibrations on the combs by performing a conspicuous abdominal oscillatory behavior, known as abdominal wagging. Several studies have reported correlative evidence in support of its signaling role, but direct evidence is still lacking. Because abdominal wagging is strictly associated with the presence of larvae in the nest and with cell inspection, it has been suggested that it could be involved in adult- larvae communication. According to this hypothesis, abdominal wagging vibrations would have short-term effects related to food and trophallactic exchanges between adults and larvae by modulating salivary secretion (decreasing its amount, to prepare larvae to receive food, or stimulating the release of larval saliva to adults). Here, by using an electro-magnetic shaker, we assessed, for the first time, the short-term effects of abdominal wagging on larval behavior by recording larval responses and by measuring the amount of saliva released immediately after abdominal wagging playback. Our results show that larvae are able to perceive the substrate-borne vibrations produced by abdominal wagging and react by increasing the movement of their body, possibly in order to attract the attention of adult females during feeding nest inspection. Yet, we found that vibrations neither increase nor decrease the release of larval saliva. Our results support the hypothesis of the alleged role of vibrations in adult-larvae communications; however, they do not support the longlasting hypothesis of salivary release modulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult-brood communication", "Biotremology", "Larval behavior", "Larval saliva", "Playback experiment", "Substrate-borne vibrations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Communication", "Animals", "Female", "Larva", "Vibration", "Wasps"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054897174", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"57200581687": {"Name": "Pepiciello I.", "AuthorID": "57200581687", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Biologia, Universita di Firenze"}, "22133717200": {"Name": "Cini A.", "AuthorID": "22133717200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, University College London"}, "55951458900": {"Name": "Nieri R.", "AuthorID": "55951458900", "AffiliationID": "60073834", "AffiliationName": "Research and Innovation Centre, Department of Sustainable Ecosystems and Bioresources, Fondazione Edmund Mach"}, "6603953920": {"Name": "Cervo R.", "AuthorID": "6603953920", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Biologia, Universita di Firenze"}, "25722251000": {"Name": "Mazzoni V.", "AuthorID": "25722251000", "AffiliationID": "60091778, 60013402", "AffiliationName": "North Willamette Research and Extension Center, Oregon State University"}}}
