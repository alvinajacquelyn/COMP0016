Current management is inadequate, with high recurrence rates. Our objective was to review the literature regarding the role of HPV vaccine in secondary prevention and treatment of VIN/VaIN. Methods: Database searches included Ovid Medline, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and Clinicaltrials.gov. Search terms included HPV vaccine AND therapeutic vaccine\u2217AND VIN OR VAIN, published in English with no defined date limit. Searches were carried out with a UCL librarian in March 2018. We included any type of study design using any form of HPV vaccine in the treatment of women with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of VIN/VaIN. We excluded studies of other lower genital tract disease, vulval/vaginal carcinoma and prophylactic use of vaccines. The outcome measures were lesion response to vaccination, symptom improvement, immune response and HPV clearance. Results: We identified 93 articles, 7 studies met our inclusion criteria; these were uncontrolled case series. There were no RCTs or systematic reviews identified. Reduction in lesion size was reported by all 7 studies, symptom relief by 5, HPV clearance by 6, histological regression by 5, and immune response by 6. Conclusions: This review finds the evidence relating to the use of HPV vaccine in the treatment of women with VIN/VaIN is of very low quality and insufficient to guide practice. Further longitudinal studies are needed to assess its use in prevention of progression to cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HPV vaccine", "Therapeutic vaccine", "VAIN", "VIN", "Vulval disorders", "Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Carcinoma in Situ", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Papillomavirus Vaccines", "Treatment Outcome", "Vaginal Neoplasms", "Vulvar Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059746305", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57205367007": {"Name": "Bryan S.", "AuthorID": "57205367007", "AffiliationID": "121941269", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Gynaecology Cancer Research Centre, Maple House"}, "57205358826": {"Name": "Barbara C.", "AuthorID": "57205358826", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}, "57213372124": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "57213372124", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}, "35596293800": {"Name": "Olaitan A.", "AuthorID": "35596293800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals"}}}
