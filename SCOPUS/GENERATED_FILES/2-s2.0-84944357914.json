We set out to evaluate the use of this system by blind subjects to achieve object localisation and prehension in 3-dimensional space. Methods: This is a single-centre, prospective, internally-controlled case series involving 5 blind RP subjects who received the Argus\u00ae II implant. The subjects were instructed to visually locate, reach and grasp (i.e. prehension) a small white cuboid object placed at random locations on a black worktop. A flashing LED beacon was attached to the reaching index finger (as a finger marker) to assess the effect of enhanced finger visualisation on performance. Tasks were performed with the prosthesis switched \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d and with the finger marker switched \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d. Forty-eight trials were performed per subject. Trajectory of each subject\u2019s hand movement during the task was recorded by a 3D motion-capture unit (Qualysis\u00ae, see supplementary video) and analysed using a MATLAB script. Result: Percentage of successful prehension\u00b1standard deviation was: 71.3 \u00b1 27.1 % with prosthesis on and finger marker on; 77.5 \u00b1 24.5 % with prosthesis on and finger marker off; 0.0 \u00b1 0.0 % with prosthesis off and finger marker on, and 0.00 \u00b1 0.00 % with prosthesis off and finger marker off. The finger marker did not have a significant effect on performance (P = 0.546 and 1, Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, with prosthesis on and off respectively). With prosthesis off, none of the subjects were able to visually locate the target object and no initiation of prehension was attempted. With prosthesis on, prehension was initiated on 82.5 % (range 59\u2013100 %) of the trials with 89.0 % (range 66.7\u2013100 %) achieving successful prehension. Conclusion: Argus\u00ae II subjects were able to achieve object localisation and prehension better with their prosthesis switched on than off.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial retina", "Outer retinal degeneration", "Psychophysical testing", "Retinal prosthesis", "Retinitis pigmentosa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blindness", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Proprioception", "Prospective Studies", "Prosthesis Implantation", "Psychomotor Performance", "Psychophysiology", "Retina", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Visual Prosthesis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944357914", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55934362700": {"Name": "Luo Y.H.L.", "AuthorID": "55934362700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreoretinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55930528600": {"Name": "Zhong J.J.", "AuthorID": "55930528600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, National Institute of Health Research, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701376895": {"Name": "da Cruz L.", "AuthorID": "6701376895", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
