Ex vivo modification of T cells is currently limited to a small number of centers with the required infrastructure and expertise. The process requires isolation, activation, transduction, expansion and cryopreservation steps. To simplify procedures and widen applicability for clinical therapies, automation of these procedures is being developed. The CliniMACS Prodigy (Miltenyi Biotec) has recently been adapted for lentiviral transduction of T cells and here we analyse the feasibility of a clinically compliant T-cell engineering process for the manufacture of T cells encoding chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) for CD19 (CAR19), a widely targeted antigen in B-cell malignancies. Using a closed, single-use tubing set we processed mononuclear cells from fresh or frozen leukapheresis harvests collected from healthy volunteer donors. Cells were phenotyped and subjected to automated processing and activation using TransAct, a polymeric nanomatrix activation reagent incorporating CD3/CD28-specific antibodies. Cells were then transduced and expanded in the CentriCult-Unit of the tubing set, under stabilized culture conditions with automated feeding and media exchange. The process was continuously monitored to determine kinetics of expansion, transduction efficiency and phenotype of the engineered cells in comparison with small-scale transductions run in parallel. We found that transduction efficiencies, phenotype and function of CAR19 T cells were comparable with existing procedures and overall T-cell yields sufficient for anticipated therapeutic dosing. The automation of closed-system T-cell engineering should improve dissemination of emerging immunotherapies and greatly widen applicability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["automation", "CAR19", "chimeric antigen receptors", "CliniMACS prodigy", "GMP", "immunotherapy", "T cells", "T-cell transduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, CD19", "Automation, Laboratory", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Engineering", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Separation", "Cells, Cultured", "Computer-Aided Design", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transduction, Genetic", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991821264", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"57147817100": {"Name": "Mock U.", "AuthorID": "57147817100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London"}, "57191594063": {"Name": "Nickolay L.", "AuthorID": "57191594063", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London"}, "35912174200": {"Name": "Zhan H.", "AuthorID": "35912174200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London"}, "11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London"}, "55759124700": {"Name": "Philip B.", "AuthorID": "55759124700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "56884070200": {"Name": "Cheung G.W.K.", "AuthorID": "56884070200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "57211009223": {"Name": "Pule M.", "AuthorID": "57211009223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "7203073213": {"Name": "Johnston I.C.D.", "AuthorID": "7203073213", "AffiliationID": "60074947", "AffiliationName": "Research & Development, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"}, "13006002400": {"Name": "Kaiser A.D.", "AuthorID": "13006002400", "AffiliationID": "60074947", "AffiliationName": "Research & Development, Miltenyi Biotec GmbH"}}}
