Microglia are essential mediators of neuroinflammation and can regulate a broad spectrum of cellular responses by releasing reactive oxygen intermediates, nitric oxide, proteases, excitatory amino acids, and cytokines. We have recently shown that also in ex-vivo cortical networks of neurons, astrocytes and microglia, an increased level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) was detected a few hours after exposure to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Simultaneously, an atypical \"seizure-like\" neuronal network activity was recorded by multi-electrode array (MEA) electrophysiology. These effects were prevented by minocycline, an established anti-inflammatory antibiotic. We show here that the same inhibitory effect against LPS-induced neuroinflammation is exerted also by natural plant compounds, polyphenols, such as curcumin (CU, curcuma longa), crocin (CR, saffron), and resveratrol (RE, grape), as well as by the glucagon like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist exendin-4 (EX-4). The drugs tested also caused per-se early transient (variable) changes of network activity. Since it has been reported that LPS-induced neuroinflammation causes rearrangements of glutamate transporters in astrocytes and microglia, we suggest that neural activity could be putatively increased by an imbalance of glial glutamate transporter activity, leading to prolonged synaptic glutamatergic dysregulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Exendin-4 (EX-4)", "GLP-1", "LPS", "Multi-electrode array (MEA)", "Neocortical cultures", "Plant polyphenols", "Sterile inflammation", "TNF-\u03b1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028915787", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"23389125300": {"Name": "Gullo F.", "AuthorID": "23389125300", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences and Milan Center for Neuroscience, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "6603395572": {"Name": "Ceriani M.", "AuthorID": "6603395572", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences and Milan Center for Neuroscience, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "35552555300": {"Name": "Costa B.", "AuthorID": "35552555300", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences and Milan Center for Neuroscience, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "57207548430": {"Name": "Lecchi M.", "AuthorID": "57207548430", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences and Milan Center for Neuroscience, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "56545339500": {"Name": "D'Aloia A.", "AuthorID": "56545339500", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "7005961547": {"Name": "Wanke E.", "AuthorID": "7005961547", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology and Biosciences, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "7006013892": {"Name": "Constanti A.", "AuthorID": "7006013892", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
