Low-rank representation (LRR) has proved its effectiveness in the denoising of HSIs. However, it just employs local information for denoising, which results in ineffectiveness when local noise is heavy. In this paper, we propose an approach of group low-rank representation (GLRR) for the HSI denoising. In our GLRR, a corrupted HSI is divided into overlapping patches, the similar patches are combined into a group, and the group is reconstructed as a whole using LRR. The proposed method enables the exploitation of both the local similarity within a patch and the nonlocal similarity across the patches in a group simultaneously. The additional nonlocally similar patches can bring in extra structural information to the corrupted patches, facilitating the detection of noise as outliers. LRR is applied to the group of patches, as the uncorrupted patches enjoy intrinsic low-rank structure. The effectiveness of the proposed GLRR method is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively by using both simulated and real-world data in experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Denoising", "hyperspectral image (HSI)", "low-rank representation (LRR)", "nonlocal similarity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environment monitoring", "Hyperspectral images", "Local information", "Local similarity", "Low-rank representations", "Non-local similarities", "Rank structure", "Structural information"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959920726", "SubjectAreas": [["Computers in Earth Sciences", "EART", "1903"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"57155380500": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "57155380500", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60104026", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "55726588900": {"Name": "Sun W.", "AuthorID": "55726588900", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60104026", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "56156076900": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "56156076900", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "College of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing University of Technology"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
