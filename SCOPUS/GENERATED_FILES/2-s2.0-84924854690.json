However, variations in the optical path length during the finite measurement time severely limit the applicability of the method in real-world environments. By the use of a second swept source measurements become immune to these variations. The use of a second source implies a great increase in costs and complexity. In this letter, we explore the possibility of using four wave mixing for the generation of the secondary swept frequency source. This greatly reduces the increase in costs and solves the synchronization issues often encountered by dual laser systems. A prototype has been built and tested against induced variations in the optical path length, proving the ability of the technique to improve distance measurements in industrial environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distance Measurements", "Four Wave Mixing", "FSL", "Sweep Laser Applications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Frequency scanning interferometry", "FSL", "Industrial environments", "Measurement time", "Optical path lengths", "Real world environments", "Reflecting targets", "Sweep frequencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924854690", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57214262153": {"Name": "Martinez J.", "AuthorID": "57214262153", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computing Engineering and Science, University of South Wales"}, "6506154994": {"Name": "Copner N.", "AuthorID": "6506154994", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computing Engineering and Science, University of South Wales"}, "56553589500": {"Name": "Campbell M.", "AuthorID": "56553589500", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "36103699200": {"Name": "Warden M.", "AuthorID": "36103699200", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "8591127400": {"Name": "Hughes E.", "AuthorID": "8591127400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "27168132300": {"Name": "Lewis A.", "AuthorID": "27168132300", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}}}
