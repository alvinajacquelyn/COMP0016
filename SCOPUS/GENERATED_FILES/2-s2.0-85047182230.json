Here, the lung is modeled as a two-phase composite material where the alveolar air-filling corresponds to the inclusion phase. The theory predicts a linear relationship between the real and the imaginary parts of the change in the complex valued conductivity of a lung during tidal breathing, and where the loss cotangent of the change is approximately the same as of the effective background conductivity and hence easy to estimate. The theory is illustrated with numerical examples based on realistic parameter values and frequency ranges used with electrical impedance tomography (EIT). The theory may be potentially useful for imaging and clinical evaluations in connection with lung EIT for respiratory management and control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dielectric properties of biological tissue", "dielectric properties of lung tissue", "electrical impedance tomography", "homogenization theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dielectric properties of biological tissue", "Electrical impe dance tomography (EIT)", "Electrical impedance tomography", "Homogenization theory", "Linear relationships", "Lung tissue", "Management and controls", "Two phase composites"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047182230", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"6701710645": {"Name": "Nordebo S.", "AuthorID": "6701710645", "AffiliationID": "60108011", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering, Linn\u00e6 Us University"}, "26530591000": {"Name": "Dalarsson M.", "AuthorID": "26530591000", "AffiliationID": "60108011", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering, Linn\u00e6 Us University"}, "53663591300": {"Name": "Khodadad D.", "AuthorID": "53663591300", "AffiliationID": "60108011", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering, Linn\u00e6 Us University"}, "57189592708": {"Name": "M\u00fcller B.", "AuthorID": "57189592708", "AffiliationID": "60111525", "AffiliationName": "Swisstom AG"}, "57202108570": {"Name": "Waldman A.D.", "AuthorID": "57202108570", "AffiliationID": "60111525", "AffiliationName": "Swisstom AG"}, "55892711000": {"Name": "Becher T.", "AuthorID": "55892711000", "AffiliationID": "60005542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Centre Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel"}, "55091385100": {"Name": "Frerichs I.", "AuthorID": "55091385100", "AffiliationID": "60005542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Medical Centre Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel"}, "57202119196": {"Name": "Sophocleous L.", "AuthorID": "57202119196", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "KIOS Research Center, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "6603778677": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6berg D.", "AuthorID": "6603778677", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Information Technology, Lund University"}, "35103442400": {"Name": "Seifnaraghi N.", "AuthorID": "35103442400", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Sciences, Middlesex University, Hendon Campus"}, "6603764288": {"Name": "Bayford R.", "AuthorID": "6603764288", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Sciences, Middlesex University, Hendon Campus"}}}
