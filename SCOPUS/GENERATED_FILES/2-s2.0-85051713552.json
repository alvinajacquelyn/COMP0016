However, as applications and research on it are limited, there is still little evidence on what this new phenomenon could bring to the transport sector. This paper aims to provide initial insights into whether MaaS product bundles (monthly subscription plans) can be used as a mobility management tool to promote shared modes. Data from an original survey, specifically designed to study MaaS plans, was used with Greater London as the case study area. The results show, that even though respondents do not prefer shared modes in their MaaS plans, a significant number of them are willing to subscribe to plans that include these modes. Once they have subscribed, over 60% of them indicated that they would be willing to try transportation modes that they previously did not use if their MaaS plans included them. These initial results show evidence that MaaS bundles can indeed be used as a mobility management tool to introduce more travelers to shared modes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bundling", "Choice modelling", "Demand management", "MaaS subscription plans", "Mobility as a service", "Mobility management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bundling", "Choice modelling", "MaaS subscription plans", "Mobility management", "Service bundles", "Transport industry", "Transport sectors", "Transportation mode"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051713552", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"57191516867": {"Name": "Matyas M.", "AuthorID": "57191516867", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, MaaSLab, University College London"}, "49861504700": {"Name": "Kamargianni M.", "AuthorID": "49861504700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, MaaSLab, University College London"}}}
