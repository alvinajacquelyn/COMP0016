Shah, A. Bennett and E. Southgate Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.Higher education in Brazil has expanded rapidly over the last 20 years, reaching a total of over 7 million students and over 2000 institutions. However, the net enrollment ratio is still low at only 15%, and students are drawn mainly from the upper socio-economic groups, with particularly low participation of African Brazilian and indigenous communities. Issues around access to higher education have gained political prominence in recent years, leading to a heated national debate and a range of policy initiatives, driven primarily by the strength of social movements, particularly the Black Movement. In order to expand access in the private sector, the Prouni initiative has opened free-of-charge places for lower-income students in private institutions in exchange for tax breaks. This initiative has been highly successful in numerical terms, with over 1 million students benefiting from the program, though it has given rise to a range of critiques, in terms of the quality of institutions in question, and transfer of public funds to profit-making corporations. Another prominent policy development has been the introduction of quotas. Following a range of mobilizations and affirmative action policies in individual universities, the government has now passed a law guaranteeing places in federal universities for students of African Brazilian and indigenous origin from public schools. While these policies have had significant impact, the country is still far from fully addressing the challenge of widening participation. This chapter assesses the merits of existing initiatives, and draws out implications for institutional and governmental policy for the coming years, assessing the significance of the Brazilian experience for other contexts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Access to higher education", "Affirmative action", "Brazil", "Higher education policy", "Social movements", "Widening participation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980417092", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"57190496805": {"Name": "Nor\u00f5es K.", "AuthorID": "57190496805", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "University of Campinas"}, "8424780600": {"Name": "McCowan T.", "AuthorID": "8424780600", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
