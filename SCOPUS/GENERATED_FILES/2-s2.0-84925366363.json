The role of hypoxia in epidermal differentiation and skin barrier function is incompletely understood. In this issue, Wong et al. show that hypoxia-inducible factors are central to the processes of epidermal differentiation and barrier formation, in particular by promoting the expression of the key skin barrier protein filaggrin.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Epidermis", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Intermediate Filament Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925366363", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7004306801": {"Name": "O'Shaughnessy R.F.L.", "AuthorID": "7004306801", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Livingstone Skin Research Centre, Dermatology and Immunobiology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55865568474": {"Name": "Brown S.J.", "AuthorID": "55865568474", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Institute, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee"}}}
