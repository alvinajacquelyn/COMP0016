In this study, we used novel inorganic microfibres guided by phosphate glass (PG). PG fibres (PGfs) were aligned on compressed collagen that was rolled into a nerve conduit. In vitro tests confirmed that adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons showed active neurite outgrowth along the fibres, with a maximum number and length of neurites being significantly higher than those cultured on tissue culture plastic. In vivo experiments with nerve conduits that either contained PGfs (PGf/Col) or lacked them (Col) were conducted on transected sciatic nerves of rats for up to 12weeks. One week after implantation, the PGf/Col group showed many axons extending along the scaffold, whereas the Col group showed none. Eight weeks after implantation, the PGf/Col group exhibited greater recovery of plantar muscle atrophy than the Col group. Electrophysiological studies revealed that some animals in the PGf/Col group at 6 and 7weeks post-implantation (5.3% and 15.8%, respectively) showed compound muscle action potential. The Col group over the same period showed no response. Motor function also showed faster recovery in the PGf/Col group compared to the Col group up to 7weeks. However, there was no significant difference in the number of axons, muscle atrophy or motor and sensory functions between the two groups at 12weeks post-implantation. In summary, phosphate glass fibres can promote directional growth of axons in cases of peripheral nerve injury by acting as physical guides.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axonal outgrowth", "Electrophysiology", "Muscle denervation", "Peripheral nerve injury", "Phosphate glass fibre", "Sciatic functional index", "Sciatic nerve", "Von Frey hair test"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Glass", "Neurites", "Peripheral Nerve Injuries", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Recovery of Function", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925674775", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55372689700": {"Name": "Kim Y.P.", "AuthorID": "55372689700", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "35315874200": {"Name": "Lee G.S.", "AuthorID": "35315874200", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "14019927600": {"Name": "Kim J.W.", "AuthorID": "14019927600", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "57212315836": {"Name": "Kim M.S.", "AuthorID": "57212315836", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "55372605600": {"Name": "Ahn H.S.", "AuthorID": "55372605600", "AffiliationID": "60170569, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tissue Regeneration Engineering, Dankook University"}, "56591525500": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "56591525500", "AffiliationID": "60170568, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials Science, School of Dentistry, Dankook University"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7202748992": {"Name": "Hyun J.K.", "AuthorID": "7202748992", "AffiliationID": "60000304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Dankook University College of Medicine"}, "56493292800": {"Name": "Lim J.Y.", "AuthorID": "56493292800", "AffiliationID": "60000656", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine"}, "35180285100": {"Name": "Son Y.J.", "AuthorID": "35180285100", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60018188", "AffiliationName": "Shriners Hospital's Pediatric Research Center, Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Temple University School of Medicine"}}}
