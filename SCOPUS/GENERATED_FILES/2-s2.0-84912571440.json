To estimate the model-intrinsic elasticities, we explore the use of dynamic linear panel data models. On the basis of 26 scenarios (panels) between 2010 and 2050, our analysis suggests that nearly all model-intrinsic elasticities with respect to final energy use are roughly comparable to each other, to those observed historically, and to those from other studies. The key difference is these models\u2019 comparatively low intrinsic income elasticity of final energy use. This and other minor differences are interpreted through key assumptions underlying both energy-economy-models.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic linear", "Final energy", "Historical trends", "Income elasticities", "Panel data models", "Transportation sector"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912571440", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"57209993091": {"Name": "Sch\u00e4fer A.", "AuthorID": "57209993091", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Precourt Energy Efficiency Center, Stanford University"}, "35221968600": {"Name": "Kyle P.", "AuthorID": "35221968600", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Pacific Northwest Laboratory, Joint Global Change Research Institute"}, "55056564200": {"Name": "Pietzcker R.", "AuthorID": "55056564200", "AffiliationID": "60025182", "AffiliationName": "Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"}}}
