Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy.Objectives: To describe trends in prevalence, susceptibility profile and risk factors for MDR Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MDR-NG) in England and Wales. Methods: Isolates from16 242 gonorrhoea episodes at sexual health clinics within the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP) underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing. MDR-NG was defined as resistance to ceftriaxone, cefixime or azithromycin, plus at least two of penicillin, ciprofloxacin and spectinomycin. Trends in resistance are presented for 2004-15; prevalence and logistic regression analyses for MDR-NG cover the period of the most recent treatment guideline (ceftriaxone plus azithromycin), 2011-15. Results: Between 2004 and 2015, the proportion of N. gonorrhoeae isolates fully susceptible to all antimicrobial classes fell from 80% to 46%, with the proportion resistant to multiple (two or more) classes increasing from 7.3% to 17.5%. In 2011-15, 3.5% of isolates were MDR-NG, most of which were resistant to cefixime (100% in 2011, decreasing to 36.9% in 2015) and/or azithromycin (4.2% in 2011, increasing to 84.3% in 2015). After excluding azithromycin-resistant isolates, modal azithromycin MICs were higher in MDR versus non-MDR isolates (0.5 versus 0.125 mg/L), with similar results for ceftriaxone (modal MICs 0.03 versus \u22640.002 mg/L). After adjustment for confounders, MDR-NG was more common among isolates from heterosexual men, although absolute differences in prevalence were small [4.6%versus 3.3% (MSM) and 2.5% (women)]. Conclusions: N. gonorrhoeae is becoming less susceptible to available antimicrobials. Since 2011, a minority of isolates were MDR-NG; however, MICs of azithromycin or ceftriaxone (first-line therapies) for many of these were elevated. These findings highlight the importance of continued antimicrobial stewardship for gonorrhoea.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "England", "Epidemiological Monitoring", "Female", "Gonorrhea", "Humans", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Middle Aged", "Neisseria gonorrhoeae", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Wales", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044850544", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55245779400": {"Name": "Clifton S.", "AuthorID": "55245779400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57201446935": {"Name": "Bolt H.", "AuthorID": "57201446935", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "57197789900": {"Name": "Mohammed H.", "AuthorID": "57197789900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "55758083900": {"Name": "Town K.", "AuthorID": "55758083900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "36027423400": {"Name": "Furegato M.", "AuthorID": "36027423400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "7401806224": {"Name": "Cole M.", "AuthorID": "7401806224", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "35110460800": {"Name": "Fifer H.", "AuthorID": "35110460800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "7005827782": {"Name": "Campbell O.", "AuthorID": "7005827782", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
