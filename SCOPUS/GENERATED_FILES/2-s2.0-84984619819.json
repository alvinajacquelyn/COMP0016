We highlight technical, social and professional role continuities and changes, shaped by the institutionalisation of survey researchers, the professionalization of the field interviewer, and economisation. While there are similarities between the surveys in that field interviewers were and are at the bottom of the research hierarchy, we demonstrate an increasing segregation between the core research team and field interviewers. In PinUK the field interviewers are visible in the paper survey booklets; through their handwritten notes on codes and in written marginalia they can \u2018talk\u2019 to the central research team. In PSE they are absent from the computer mediated data, and from communication with the central team. We argue that, while there have been other benefits to field interviewers, their relational labour has become less visible in a shift from the exercise of observational judgement to an emphasis on standardisation. Yet, analyses of what field interviewers actually do show that they still need to deploy the same interpersonal skills and resourcefulness to secure and maintain interviews as they did 45 years previously.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Field interviewers", "History of social surveys", "Micro paradata", "Peter Townsend", "Poverty research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984619819", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55242502800": {"Name": "Edwards R.", "AuthorID": "55242502800", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60176935", "AffiliationName": "ESRC National Centre for Research Methods, University of Southampton"}, "7004228641": {"Name": "Phoenix A.", "AuthorID": "7004228641", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57114421100": {"Name": "Elliott H.", "AuthorID": "57114421100", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57193754019": {"Name": "Gordon D.", "AuthorID": "57193754019", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "The Townsend Centre for International Poverty Research, University of Bristol"}, "7401917238": {"Name": "Bell K.", "AuthorID": "7401917238", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "The Townsend Centre for International Poverty Research, University of Bristol"}, "16636026300": {"Name": "Fahmy E.", "AuthorID": "16636026300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "The Townsend Centre for International Poverty Research, University of Bristol"}}}
