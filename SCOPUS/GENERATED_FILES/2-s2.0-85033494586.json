Optical components, such as mirrors and lenses, are now being fabricated via additive manufacturing, where the printed substrate is polished in a post-processing step. One application of additively manufactured optics could be within the astronomical X-ray community, where there is a growing need to demonstrate thin, lightweight, high precision optics for a beyond Chandra style mission. This paper will follow a proof-of-concept investigation, sponsored by the UK Space Agency's National Space Technology Programme, into the feasibility of applying additive manufacturing in the production of thin, lightweight, precision X-ray optics for astronomy. One of the benefits of additive manufacturing is the ability to construct intricate lightweighting, which can be optimised to minimise weight while ensuring rigidity. This concept of optimised lightweighting will be applied to a series of polished additively manufactured test samples and experimental data from these samples, including an assessment of the optical quality and the magnitude of any print-through, will be presented. In addition, the finite element analysis optimisations of the lightweighting development will be discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Additive manufacturing", "lightweighting", "nite element analysis", "topol-ogy optimisation", "X-ray optics", "X-ray telescope"], "IndexKeywords": ["Element analysis", "High-precision optics", "Lightweighting", "Optical components", "Optical qualities", "Optimisations", "Space technologies", "X ray telescope"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033494586", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"24069736100": {"Name": "Atkins C.", "AuthorID": "24069736100", "AffiliationID": "60006858", "AffiliationName": "UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Royal Observatory"}, "56968574700": {"Name": "Watson S.", "AuthorID": "56968574700", "AffiliationID": "60006858", "AffiliationName": "UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Royal Observatory"}, "36522537700": {"Name": "Cochrane W.", "AuthorID": "36522537700", "AffiliationID": "60006858", "AffiliationName": "UK Astronomy Technology Centre, Royal Observatory"}, "57196465566": {"Name": "Roulet M.", "AuthorID": "57196465566", "AffiliationID": "60007671, 60008134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille"}, "24070521000": {"Name": "Feldman C.", "AuthorID": "24070521000", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "56259878200": {"Name": "Willingale R.", "AuthorID": "56259878200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "7403482947": {"Name": "Brooks D.", "AuthorID": "7403482947", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "6506833394": {"Name": "Doel P.", "AuthorID": "6506833394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "14824850700": {"Name": "Hugot E.", "AuthorID": "14824850700", "AffiliationID": "60007671, 60008134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille"}}}
