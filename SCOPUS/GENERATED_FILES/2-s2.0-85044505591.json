Design: Participants assigned International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale scores to 16 clinical cases. Consensual validity was measured against reference scores determined by an author reference panel. Interrater reliability was measured overall and across quartile subsets of the dataset. Criterion validity was evaluated versus Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores assigned by survey respondents to the same case scenarios. Feedback was requested regarding ease and likelihood of use. Setting: Web-based survey. Participants: Respondents (N=170) from 29 countries. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Consensual validity (percent agreement and Kendall \u03c4), criterion validity (Spearman rank correlation), and interrater reliability (Kendall concordance and intraclass coefficients). Results: The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale showed strong consensual validity, criterion validity, and interrater reliability. Scenarios involving liquid-only diets, transition from nonoral feeding, or trial diet advances in therapy showed the poorest consensus, indicating a need for clear instructions on how to score these situations. The International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale showed greater sensitivity than the FOIS to specific changes in diet. Most (>70%) respondents indicated enthusiasm for implementing the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale. Conclusions: This initial validation study suggests that the International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Functional Diet Scale has strong consensual and criterion validity and can be used reliably by clinicians to capture diet texture restriction and progression in people with dysphagia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deglutition", "Deglutition disorders", "Rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Deglutition Disorders", "Diet", "Diet Surveys", "Humans", "Observer Variation", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044505591", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"7101798810": {"Name": "Steele C.M.", "AuthorID": "7101798810", "AffiliationID": "102066764", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Adelphi University"}, "57195107548": {"Name": "Namasivayam-MacDonald A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195107548", "AffiliationID": "102066764", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders, Adelphi University"}, "57201378475": {"Name": "Guida B.T.", "AuthorID": "57201378475", "AffiliationID": "60030951, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Rehabilitation Institute \u2013 University Health Network"}, "6603017513": {"Name": "Cichero J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603017513", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology"}, "55256140200": {"Name": "Duivestein J.", "AuthorID": "55256140200", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "University of British Columbia"}, "7102037062": {"Name": "Hanson B.", "AuthorID": "7102037062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56402559100": {"Name": "Lam P.", "AuthorID": "56402559100", "AffiliationID": "114726452", "AffiliationName": "Peter Lam Consulting"}, "15823208700": {"Name": "Riquelme L.F.", "AuthorID": "15823208700", "AffiliationID": "60029961", "AffiliationName": "New York Medical College"}}}
