The planning problem is explored in a rolling horizon fashion coupled with demand forecasts. Proactive and reactive approaches are employed to handle the effect of stochastic variations. Depending on the nature of the uncertain parameters robust optimisation and chance constrained programming are employed. For the closed-loop implementation of the control, novel multi-parametric controllers are designed. The proposed framework is tested on the iPSC of a polymerisation process. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to highlight the benefits of the \u201cuncertainty-aware\u201d solutions when compared to the deterministic ones.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chance constrained programming", "enterprise wide optimisation", "multi-parametric programming", "robust optimisation", "uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050610651", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57189662256": {"Name": "Charitopoulos V.M.", "AuthorID": "57189662256", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Process Systems Engineering, University College London"}, "36663489200": {"Name": "Aguirre A.M.", "AuthorID": "36663489200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Process Systems Engineering, University College London"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Process Systems Engineering, University College London"}, "7005602392": {"Name": "Dua V.", "AuthorID": "7005602392", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Process Systems Engineering, University College London"}}}
