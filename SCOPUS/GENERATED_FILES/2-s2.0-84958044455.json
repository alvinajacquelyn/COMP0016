The complex, energetic/electrical networks established not only by digital communication technologies but also between Ma\u00afori people and their taonga (treasured possessions) expand the understanding of both photographic indexicality and Runias definition of presence. The wairua, or spiritual energies, channelled in Ma\u00afori relationships as they are transmitted through important cultural treasures creates a profound experience of co-presence in which objects are understood as simultaneous links to the past, present and future. The article argues that the experience of co-presence in both Ma\u00afori engagements with important museum objects and the experience of networked digital communications technologies (including digital photographs) allows us to develop an expanded understanding of provenance, or where objects come from (and who they belong to) in museums.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958044455", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"6603438933": {"Name": "Geismar H.", "AuthorID": "6603438933", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}}}
