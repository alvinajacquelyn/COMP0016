How do I diagnose this? Where do I look for solutions to this problem? We build bridges between regression models and qualitative comparative analysis by comparing diagnostics and solutions to the problem of omitted variables and conditions. We then discuss various approaches and tackle the theoretical issues around causality which must be addressed before attending to technical fixes. In the conclusions, we reflect on the bridges built between the two traditions and draw more general lessons about the logic of social science research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Causality", "Econometrics", "Qualitative comparative analysis", "Regression analysis", "Research design"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040662155", "SubjectAreas": [["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"6701387604": {"Name": "Radaelli C.", "AuthorID": "6701387604", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, Centre for European Governance, University of Exeter"}, "14069392700": {"Name": "Wagemann C.", "AuthorID": "14069392700", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, Faculty of Social Sciences, Goethe University"}}}
