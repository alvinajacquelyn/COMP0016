Methods A cohort of genotypically confirmed choroideremia cases who underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging was studied. Using HEYEX review software, the foveal centre was marked on FAF images under guidance of corresponding OCT images, followed by application of an ETDRS grid. The boundaries of preserved autofluorescence (AF) were manually segmented in each individual ETDRS subfield. The regional distribution of preserved AF was assessed by comparing its area among the various subfields. Results A total of 168 eyes from 84 choroideremia cases were enrolled. There was a statistically significant difference in the amount of preserved AF area between inner subfields as determined by one-way analysis of variance (F (3,668)=9.997, p<0.001) and also between outer subfields (F (3,668)=8.348, p<0.001). A Tukey posthoc test revealed that the preserved AF area in the nasal subfields in both the inner and outer subfields was significantly smaller compared with analogue subfields. Conclusion The asymmetric spatial distribution of preserved AF in choroideremia (corresponding to the stellate shaped nature of these regions) suggests that the progression of degeneration has directional preference.", "AuthorKeywords": ["choroideremia", "ellipsoid zone", "fundus autofluorescence", "optical coherence tomography", "preserved autofluorescence", "retinal pigment epithelium"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054796026", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56970880600": {"Name": "Hariri A.H.", "AuthorID": "56970880600", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California-Los Angeles"}, "7102423269": {"Name": "Ip M.S.", "AuthorID": "7102423269", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California-Los Angeles"}, "6701477860": {"Name": "Sadda S.", "AuthorID": "6701477860", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California-Los Angeles"}, "7005875007": {"Name": "Gorin M.B.", "AuthorID": "7005875007", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California-Los Angeles"}, "14024366100": {"Name": "Girach A.", "AuthorID": "14024366100", "AffiliationID": "60112711", "AffiliationName": "Nightstar Therapeutics"}, "7102023617": {"Name": "Lam B.L.", "AuthorID": "7102023617", "AffiliationID": "60016686, 60029251", "AffiliationName": "Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami Miller, School of Medicine"}, "7402921574": {"Name": "Fischer M.D.", "AuthorID": "7402921574", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ophthalmology, University of Tubingen"}, "7003405932": {"Name": "Sankila E.M.", "AuthorID": "7003405932", "AffiliationID": "60016987", "AffiliationName": "Helsinki University Eye Hospital"}, "7003510165": {"Name": "Pennesi M.E.", "AuthorID": "7003510165", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "57201820304": {"Name": "Holz F.G.", "AuthorID": "57201820304", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "35248422600": {"Name": "Maclaren R.E.", "AuthorID": "35248422600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "56852126400": {"Name": "Birch D.G.", "AuthorID": "56852126400", "AffiliationID": "60006874", "AffiliationName": "Retina Foundation of the Southwest"}, "57210606602": {"Name": "Hoyng C.B.", "AuthorID": "57210606602", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "35477245200": {"Name": "Macdonald I.M.", "AuthorID": "35477245200", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Alberta"}, "7102294178": {"Name": "Black G.C.", "AuthorID": "7102294178", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60022871, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, St Mary's Hospital"}, "34870998900": {"Name": "Tsang S.H.", "AuthorID": "34870998900", "AffiliationID": "60030162, 60002388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University"}, "7005055349": {"Name": "Bressler N.M.", "AuthorID": "7005055349", "AffiliationID": "60015891, 60001117", "AffiliationName": "Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "35590748400": {"Name": "Stepien K.E.", "AuthorID": "35590748400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences"}, "7201731368": {"Name": "Larsen M.", "AuthorID": "7201731368", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Rigshospitalet and University of Copenhagen"}, "6603782611": {"Name": "Meunier I.", "AuthorID": "6603782611", "AffiliationID": "60020938, 60020540", "AffiliationName": "Eye Clinic H\u00f4pital Robert Debr\u00e9, CHRU de Reims"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
