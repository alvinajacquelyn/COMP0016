Past changes in temperature, rainfall, ice cover, sea-level and physical erosion are thought to affect weathering but the relative impact of these controls through time remains poorly constrained. This problem could be addressed if the nature of past weathering could be constrained at individual sites. In this study, we investigate the use of speleothems as local recorders of the silicate weathering proxy, Li isotopes. We analysed \u03b47Li and [Li] in speleothems that formed during the past 200 ka in two well-studied Israeli caves (Soreq and Tzavoa), as well as in the overlying soils and rocks. Leaching and mass balance of these soils and rocks show that Li is dominantly sourced from weathering of the overlying aeolian silicate soils. Speleothem \u03b47Li values are ubiquitously higher during glacials (\u223c23\u2030) than during interglacials (\u223c10\u2030), implying more congruent silicate weathering during interglacials (where \u201ccongruent\u201d means a high ratio of primary mineral dissolution to secondary mineral formation). These records provide information on the processes controlling weathering in Israel. Consideration of possible processes causing this change of weathering congruency indicates a primary role for temperature, with higher temperatures causing more congruent weathering (lower \u03b47Lispeleo). The strong relationship observed between speleothem \u03b47Li and climate at these locations suggests that Li isotopes may be a powerful tool with which to understand the local controls on weathering at other sites, and could be used to assess the distribution of weathering changes accompanying climate change, such as that of Pleistocene glacial cycles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["climate", "glaciation", "lithium isotopes", "temperature", "weathering"], "IndexKeywords": ["climate", "Fundamental component", "glaciation", "Lithium isotopes", "Mineral dissolution", "Pleistocene glacial", "Secondary mineral formation", "Silicate weathering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018301317", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57204707349": {"Name": "Pogge von Strandmann P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204707349", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "21744136400": {"Name": "Vaks A.", "AuthorID": "21744136400", "AffiliationID": "60010931", "AffiliationName": "Geological Survey of Israel"}, "57194015718": {"Name": "Jacob E.", "AuthorID": "57194015718", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7201388662": {"Name": "Henderson G.M.", "AuthorID": "7201388662", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "6701440969": {"Name": "Bar-Matthews M.", "AuthorID": "6701440969", "AffiliationID": "60010931", "AffiliationName": "Geological Survey of Israel"}, "56233184100": {"Name": "Ayalon A.", "AuthorID": "56233184100", "AffiliationID": "60010931", "AffiliationName": "Geological Survey of Israel"}}}
