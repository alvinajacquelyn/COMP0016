Accordingly, there is considerable interest in SDF-1\u03b1 as a potential biomarker of such conditions. However, SDF-1\u03b1 is rapidly degraded and inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase4 and other peptidases, and the kinetics of intact SDF-1\u03b1 remain unknown. Methods & results To facilitate investigation of full-length SDF-1\u03b1 we established an ELISA using a novel recombinant human antibody we developed called HCI.SDF1. HCI.SDF1 is specific to the N-terminal sequence of all isoforms of SDF-1 and has a comparable KD to commercially available antibodies. Together with a detection antibody specific to the \u03b1-isoform, HCI.SDF1 was used to specifically quantify full-length SDF-1\u03b1 in blood for the first time. Using RIC applied to the hind limb of Sprague-Dawley rats or the arms of healthy human volunteers, we demonstrate an increase in SDF-1\u03b1 using a commercially available antibody, as previously reported, but an unexpected decrease in full-length SDF-1\u03b1 after RIC in both species. Conclusions We report for the first time the development of a novel recombinant antibody specific to fulllength SDF-1. Applied to RIC, we demonstrate a significant decrease in SDF-1\u03b1 that is at odds with the literature and suggests a need to investigate the kinetics of full-length SDF-1\u03b1 in conditions characterised by tissue hypoxia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies", "Biomarkers", "Blotting, Western", "Chemokine CXCL12", "Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Hypoxia", "Ischemia", "Male", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Recombinant Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016944098", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26641821000": {"Name": "Bromage D.I.", "AuthorID": "26641821000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute"}, "57191581333": {"Name": "Taferner S.", "AuthorID": "57191581333", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute"}, "57193837760": {"Name": "Pillai M.", "AuthorID": "57193837760", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute"}, "10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.M.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute"}}}
