Motion tracking, which has previously been validated across an entire cataract procedure, can be a useful adjunct. We aimed to measure quantitative differences between junior and senior surgeons\u2019 performance in three distinct segments. We further explored whether automated analysis of trainee surgical videos through PhacoTracking could be aligned with metrics from the EyeSi virtual reality simulator, allowing focused improvement of these areas in a controlled environment. Methods: Prospective cohort analysis, comparing junior vs. senior surgeons\u2019 real-life performance in distinct segments of cataract surgery: continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC), phacoemulsification, and irrigation and aspiration (I&A). EyeSi metrics that could be aligned with motion tracking parameters were identified. Motion tracking parameters (instrument path length, number of movements and total time) were measured. t-test used between the two cohorts for each component to check for any significance (p < 0.05). Results: A total of 120 segments from videos of 20 junior and 20 senior surgeons were analysed. Significant differences between junior and senior surgeons were found during CCC (path length p = 0.0004; number of movements p < 0.0001; time taken p < 0.0001), phacoemulsification (path length p < 0.0001; number of movements p < 0.0001; time taken p < 0.0001), and irrigation and aspiration (path length p = 0.006; number of movements p = 0.013; time taken p = 0.036). Conclusion: Individual segments of cataract surgery analysed using motion tracking appear to discriminate between junior and senior surgeons. Alignment of motion tracking and EyeSi parameters could enable independent, task specific, objective and quantitative feedback for each segment of surgery thus mirroring the widely utilised modular training.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Capsulorhexis", "Clinical Competence", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "Educational Measurement", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Internship and Residency", "Medical Staff, Hospital", "Operating Rooms", "Ophthalmology", "Phacoemulsification", "Prospective Studies", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053512179", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57190887617": {"Name": "Balal S.", "AuthorID": "57190887617", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57203911460": {"Name": "Bader T.", "AuthorID": "57203911460", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7402033170": {"Name": "Sullivan P.", "AuthorID": "7402033170", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7406998143": {"Name": "Smith P.", "AuthorID": "7406998143", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, University of Surrey"}, "7402080966": {"Name": "Tang H.L.", "AuthorID": "7402080966", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, University of Surrey"}, "12779593000": {"Name": "Saleh G.M.", "AuthorID": "12779593000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital, The Department of Education, The UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56530286900": {"Name": "Thomsen A.S.S.", "AuthorID": "56530286900", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Academy for Medical Education and Simulation, Rigshospitalet"}, "56295883500": {"Name": "Carlson T.", "AuthorID": "56295883500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60099424", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Centre for Rehabilitation Eng. & Assistive Technology, University College London"}}}
