To-date, manual grading has been the sole reliable source of AOSLO quantification, as no automatic method has been reliably utilized for cone detection in real-world low-quality images of diseased retina. We present a novel deep learning based approach that combines information from both the confocal and non-confocal split detector AOSLO modalities to detect cones in subjects with achromatopsia. Our dual-mode deep learning based approach outperforms the state-of-the-art automated techniques and is on a par with human grading.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Automated techniques", "Automatic method", "Cone photoreceptors", "Learning-based approach", "Low qualities", "Multi-modal", "Retinal disease", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051282266", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56768202400": {"Name": "Cunefare D.", "AuthorID": "56768202400", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University"}, "57203331403": {"Name": "Blau S.", "AuthorID": "57203331403", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University"}, "6603132896": {"Name": "Farsiu S.", "AuthorID": "6603132896", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University Medical Center"}, "55179422700": {"Name": "Langlo C.", "AuthorID": "55179422700", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology, and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "7402034918": {"Name": "Carroll J.", "AuthorID": "7402034918", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "57190489812": {"Name": "Patterson E.", "AuthorID": "57190489812", "AffiliationID": "60012553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Medical College of Wisconsin"}, "35605657700": {"Name": "Dubra A.", "AuthorID": "35605657700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University"}}}
