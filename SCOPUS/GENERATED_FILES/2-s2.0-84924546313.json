However, with the newly developed coding theorem method the complexity of strings of length 2-11 can now be numerically estimated. We present the theoretical basis of algorithmic complexity for short strings (ACSS) and describe an R-package providing functions based on ACSS that will cover psychologists\u2019 needs and improve upon previous methods in three ways: (1) ACSS is now available not only for binary strings, but for strings based on up to 9 different symbols, (2) ACSS no longer requires time-consuming computing, and (3) a new approach based on ACSS gives access to an estimation of the complexity of strings of any length. Finally, three illustrative examples show how these tools can be applied to psychology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Algorithmic complexity", "Coding theorem method", "Randomness", "Subjective probability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Humans", "Psychology", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924546313", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"56181233500": {"Name": "Gauvrit N.", "AuthorID": "56181233500", "AffiliationID": "60027946", "AffiliationName": "CHArt (PARIS-reasoning), Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes"}, "46161708800": {"Name": "Singmann H.", "AuthorID": "46161708800", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "15021346100": {"Name": "Soler-Toscano F.", "AuthorID": "15021346100", "AffiliationID": "60033284", "AffiliationName": "Grupo de L\u00f3gica, Lenguaje e Informaci\u00f3n, Universidad de Sevilla"}, "38863598800": {"Name": "Zenil H.", "AuthorID": "38863598800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Computational Medicine, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institute"}}}
