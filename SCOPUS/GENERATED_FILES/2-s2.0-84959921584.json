We show that reachability in timed automata with three or more clocks is logarithmic-space inter-reducible with reachability in space-bounded counter automata with two counters. We moreover show the logarithmic-space equivalence of reachability in two-clock timed automata and space-bounded one-counter automata. This last reduction has recently been employed by Fearnley and Jurdziski to settle the computational complexity of reachability in two-clock timed automata.", "AuthorKeywords": ["counter automata", "infinite-state systems", "reachability", "timed automata"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bounded counter", "Counter automata", "Infinite state systems", "Reachability", "Reachability problem", "Timed Automata"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959921584", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"35090201500": {"Name": "Haase C.", "AuthorID": "35090201500", "AffiliationID": "60105997, 60008134, 60004981", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Sp\u00e9cification et V\u00e9rification (LSV), CNRS, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure (ENS) de Cachan"}, "55916575900": {"Name": "Ouaknine J.", "AuthorID": "55916575900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"}, "7006255182": {"Name": "Worrell J.", "AuthorID": "7006255182", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"}}}
