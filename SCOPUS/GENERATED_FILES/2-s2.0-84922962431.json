The response of these structures when subjected to cyclic loads, such as that induced by earthquakes, is strongly influenced by the bond properties between the reinforcing bars and the surrounding concrete. This paper describes the results of a testing campaign composed of seven unidirectional cyclic tests and one monotonic test performed on full-scale columns built with plain bars, without adequate reinforcement detailing for seismic demands. An additional unidirectional cyclic test was carried out on a specimen with deformed bars for reference. The influence of bond properties, a cold joint at the base, lapping of longitudinal reinforcing bars, amount of reinforcing steel, cross-section dimensions and imposed loading history (monotonic or cyclic) is discussed. Finally, a correction coefficient to the expressions of EC8-3 for the calculation of ultimate rotation capacity of columns with plain reinforcing bars is proposed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyclic behaviour of columns", "Full-scale columns tests", "Old RC structures", "Plain reinforcing bars"], "IndexKeywords": ["Correction coefficients", "Cyclic behaviour", "Existing reinforced concrete", "Full-scale columns", "RC structure", "Reinforcing bar", "Reinforcing steels", "Seismic design code"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922962431", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"12039997100": {"Name": "Melo J.", "AuthorID": "12039997100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "23135674700": {"Name": "Varum H.", "AuthorID": "23135674700", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Civil Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto"}, "7801656850": {"Name": "Rossetto T.", "AuthorID": "7801656850", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
