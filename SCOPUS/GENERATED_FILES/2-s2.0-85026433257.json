Consequently, even improvements in short-term durability may have a potential impact on cardiac cell grafting. We have developed a multimodal hydrogel-based platform comprised of a poly(ethylene glycol) network cross-linked with bioactive peptides functionalized with Gd(III) in order to monitor the localization and retention of the hydrogel in vivo by magnetic resonance imaging. In this study, we have tailored the material for cardiac applications through the inclusion of a heparin-binding peptide (HBP) sequence in the cross-linker design and formulated the gel to display mechanical properties resembling those of cardiac tissue. Luciferase-expressing cardiac stem cells (CSC-Luc2) encapsulated within these gels maintained their metabolic activity for up to 14 days in vitro. Encapsulation in the HBP hydrogels improved CSC-Luc2 retention in the mouse myocardium and hind limbs at 3 days by 6.5- and 12- fold, respectively. Thus, this novel heparin-binding based, Gd(III)-tagged hydrogel and CSC-Luc2 platform system demonstrates a tailored, in vivo detectable theranostic cell delivery system that can be implemented to monitor and assess the transplanted material and cell retention.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bioactive peptides", "Cardiac applications", "Cardiac progenitors", "Cardiac stem cells", "Cell delivery systems", "Heparin binding peptides", "Short-term durabilities", "Transplanted cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026433257", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57190893015": {"Name": "Speidel A.T.", "AuthorID": "57190893015", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "14820025000": {"Name": "Stuckey D.J.", "AuthorID": "14820025000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), University College London"}, "6701426579": {"Name": "Noseda M.", "AuthorID": "6701426579", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "23035976900": {"Name": "Abreu Paiva M.", "AuthorID": "23035976900", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7404064103": {"Name": "Schneider M.D.", "AuthorID": "7404064103", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London"}, "7402243195": {"Name": "Stevens M.M.", "AuthorID": "7402243195", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "23099047000": {"Name": "Chow L.W.", "AuthorID": "23099047000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56609734100": {"Name": "Jackson L.H.", "AuthorID": "56609734100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), University College London"}}}
