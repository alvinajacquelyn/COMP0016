Objectives: The purpose of this study was to examine the joint and stratified associations of sitting and MVPA with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, and to estimate the theoretical effect of replacing sitting time with physical activity, standing, and sleep. Methods: A longitudinal analysis of the 45 and Up Study calculated the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of sitting for each sitting-MVPA combination group and within MVPA strata. Isotemporal substitution modeling estimated the per-hour HR effects of replacing sitting. Results: A total of 8,689 deaths (1,644 due to CVD) occurred among 149,077 participants over an 8.9-year (median) follow-up. There was a statistically significant interaction between sitting and MVPA only for all-cause mortality. Sitting time was associated with both mortality outcomes in a nearly dose-response manner in the least active groups reporting <150 MVPA min/week. For example, among those reporting no MVPA, the all-cause mortality HR comparing the most sedentary (>8 h/day) to the least sedentary (<4 h/day) groups was 1.52 (95% confidence interval: 1.13 to 2.03). There was inconsistent and weak evidence for elevated CVD and all-cause mortality risks with more sitting among those meeting the lower (150 to 299 MVPA min/week) or upper (\u2265300 MVPA min/week) limits of the MVPA recommendation. Replacing sitting with walking and MVPA showed stronger associations among high sitters (>6 sitting h/day) where, for example, the per-hour CVD mortality HR for sitting replaced with vigorous activity was 0.36 (95% confidence interval: 0.17 to 0.74). Conclusions: Sitting is associated with all-cause and CVD mortality risk among the least physically active adults; moderate-to-vigorous physical activity doses equivalent to meeting the current recommendations attenuate or effectively eliminate such associations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiovascular disease", "epidemiology", "exercise", "mortality", "physical activity", "sedentary behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "New South Wales", "Physical Fitness", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Sedentary Behavior", "Sex Factors", "Sitting Position", "Survival Analysis", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064075131", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre and Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney"}, "56462191800": {"Name": "Gale J.", "AuthorID": "56462191800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre and Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney"}, "25421265100": {"Name": "Bauman A.", "AuthorID": "25421265100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre and Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney"}, "57213161043": {"Name": "Ding D.", "AuthorID": "57213161043", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre and Prevention Research Collaboration, Sydney School of Public Health, The University of Sydney"}, "57203258140": {"Name": "Ekelund U.", "AuthorID": "57203258140", "AffiliationID": "60011916, 60004030", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport Medicine, Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, and Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Sport & Exercise Medicine\u2013East Midlands, Loughborough University"}}}
