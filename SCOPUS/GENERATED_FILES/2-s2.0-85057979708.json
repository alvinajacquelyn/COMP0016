Emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) are linked to increases in premature mortality, and the simultaneous control of both pollutants through modified combustion strategies presents a significant challenge. In this work, the effects of displacing diesel fuel with hydrogen on exhaust emissions were investigated in both a single cylinder research engine and in a demonstration vehicle. In the initial stage, tests were undertaken on a supercharged, direct injection, single cylinder diesel research engine at different engine loads, intake air pressures and EGR levels. Hydrogen was aspirated with the intake air, and EGR was simulated by supplying the intake pipe with compressed nitrogen gas. The results showed a reduction in CO2 and particulate emissions with increasing H2 addition, and an increase in NOx emissions at H2 levels greater than 10% of the total input energy to the engine. The next stage involved tests on a chassis dynamometer with a small van equipped with the multi-cylinder version of the single cylinder research engine. The van was fitted with a programmable H2 augmentation system, with H2 addition levels specified by accelerator pedal position. During full drive cycle tests conducted with and without H2 augmentation up to 10%, an average rate of 1 kW of H2 was supplied to the engine. With H2 augmentation, over the total drive-cycle, reductions in CO, NOx and particle number were observed, but a higher total PM mass was recorded.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chassis dynamometer", "Combustion", "EGR", "Emissions", "Hydrogen", "Particulates"], "IndexKeywords": ["Augmentation systems", "Chassis dynamometers", "Comparative analysis", "Emissions legislation", "Particulates", "Simultaneous control", "Single cylinder engine", "Single-cylinder research engines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057979708", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55745306300": {"Name": "Talibi M.", "AuthorID": "55745306300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55174359600": {"Name": "Hellier P.", "AuthorID": "55174359600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003607190": {"Name": "Ladommatos N.", "AuthorID": "7003607190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "26654514500": {"Name": "Watkinson M.", "AuthorID": "26654514500", "AffiliationID": "60111831", "AffiliationName": "HORIBA MIRA Ltd."}}}
