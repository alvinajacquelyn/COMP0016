Methods: A sample of 80 (8\u201316 years) children due to have dental treatments under IS were randomly allocated to either the modelling video or the control video (oral hygiene instruction). The level of anxiety was recorded before and after watching the video on the Abeer Children Dental Anxiety Scale and each child\u2019s ability to cope with the subsequent procedure was assessed on the visual analogue scale. A two-group Chi-square test was used as the basis for the sample size calculation; a significance level of 0.025 was chosen rather than the conventional 0.05 to avoid spurious results arising from multiple testing. Results: Children in the test group had significantly less anxiety after watching the video than those in the control group throughout the subsequent dental procedure; particullary, at the time of the nasal mask administration (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Video modelling appeared to be effective at reducing dental anxiety and has a significant impact on the acceptance of the nasal mask administration for Inhalation Sedation in children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Children", "Modelling", "Nasal mask", "Sedation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Anesthesia, Dental", "Anesthesia, Inhalation", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Conscious Sedation", "Cooperative Behavior", "Dental Anxiety", "Female", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Male", "Masks", "Video Recording", "Visual Analog Scale"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921922490", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Dentistry (miscellaneous)", "DENT", "3501"]], "AuthorData": {"40261008800": {"Name": "Al-Namankany A.", "AuthorID": "40261008800", "AffiliationID": "60008920", "AffiliationName": "College of Dentistry, Taibah University"}, "35974110300": {"Name": "Petrie A.", "AuthorID": "35974110300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "University College London-Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7006826945": {"Name": "Ashley P.", "AuthorID": "7006826945", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "University College London-Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
