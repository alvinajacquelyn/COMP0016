Specific mutp53 proteins gain oncogenic functions (GOFs) distinct from the tumor suppressor activity of the wild-type protein. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a hallmark of solid tumors, are typically correlated with poor prognosis. Here, we report a non-cell-autonomous mechanism, whereby human mutp53 cancer cells reprogram macrophages to a tumor supportive and anti-inflammatory state. The colon cancer cells harboring GOF mutp53 selectively shed miR-1246-enriched exosomes. Uptake of these exosomes by neighboring macrophages triggers their miR-1246-dependent reprogramming into a cancer-promoting state. Mutp53-reprogammed TAMs favor anti-inflammatory immunosuppression with increased activity of TGF-\u03b2. These findings, associated with poor survival in colon cancer patients, strongly support a microenvironmental GOF role for mutp53 in actively engaging the immune system to promote cancer progression and metastasis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Colonic Neoplasms", "Exosomes", "Humans", "Macrophages", "Mice", "MicroRNAs", "Mutant Proteins", "Mutation", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042540617", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"23570791200": {"Name": "Cooks T.", "AuthorID": "23570791200", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, NCI-CCR, National Institutes of Health"}, "7006643503": {"Name": "Robles A.I.", "AuthorID": "7006643503", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, NCI-CCR, National Institutes of Health"}, "56395935900": {"Name": "Harris C.C.", "AuthorID": "56395935900", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis, NCI-CCR, National Institutes of Health"}, "14060835000": {"Name": "Pateras I.S.", "AuthorID": "14060835000", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Carcinogenesis Group, Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Medicine, National Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "35458982600": {"Name": "Gorgoulis V.G.", "AuthorID": "35458982600", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health and Science Centre"}, "26660148200": {"Name": "Jenkins L.M.", "AuthorID": "26660148200", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "57201604009": {"Name": "Appella E.", "AuthorID": "57201604009", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "56581061100": {"Name": "Patel K.M.", "AuthorID": "56581061100", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "57188975808": {"Name": "Morris J.", "AuthorID": "57188975808", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, Cambridge Research Institute"}, "6506634124": {"Name": "Forshew T.", "AuthorID": "6506634124", "AffiliationID": "120280584", "AffiliationName": "CL Cancer Institute"}}}
