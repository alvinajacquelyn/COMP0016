As it transpired, Captain P. R. S. Mani worked as an enlisted public relations officer of the British-led Indian Army but also sustained his commitment as a patriotic Indian nationalist, who gathered intelligence on the Indian diaspora in Southeast Asia and on the impact of Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army. Relatively little scholarship has focused on Asian war journalism. Mani's tension-ridden role as a self-styled 'Indian Army observer' provides an illuminating insight into the way in which Britain's lines of communication were appropriated and subverted during wartime and beyond, and into the way his own nationalism was reshaped by his unofficial transnational activities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040906455", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"8348407900": {"Name": "Goodall H.", "AuthorID": "8348407900", "AffiliationID": "60023932", "AffiliationName": "University of Technology"}, "35887072000": {"Name": "Frost M.R.", "AuthorID": "35887072000", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex"}}}
