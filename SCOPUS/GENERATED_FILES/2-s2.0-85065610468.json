Methods: Patients were assessed before and after their usual morning L-dopa dose, using the MDS Unified PD Rating Scale Part 3 (MDS UPDRS 3), and rated as definite responders (\u226524.5% improvement) or limited responders (<24.5%). Results: 1007 cases, mean age 66.1 years (SD 9.1) at diagnosis, were assessed 3.4 (SD 0.9) years after diagnosis. The L-dopa response was definite in 614 cases (61.0%), median reduction in MDS UPDRS 3 scores was 42.0%, (IQR 33.3, 53.1), and was limited in 393 cases (39.0%), median reduction in MDS UPDRS 3 scores 11.5% (IQR 4.3, 18.2). Definite responders were younger (66.3 years at study entry, SD 9.3) than limited responders (69.2 years, SD 8.4, p < 0.001). The MDS UPDRS 3 score at study entry in definite responders (21.0, SD 10.5) was significantly lower than in limited responders (24.7, SD 13.4, p < 0.001). The MDS UPDRS 3 increase over 18 months was less in definite responders at 3.0 (SD 10.4), compared to limited responders (6.4, SD 11.0, p < 0.001). The levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) was not significantly different at study entry (definite responders 317 mg, SD 199, vs limited responders 305 mg, SD 191, p = 0.53). However, LEDD was significantly higher at the time of the L-dopa challenge test in definite responders (541 mg, SD 293) compared to limited responders (485 mg, SD 215, p = 0.01). Responsiveness to L-dopa was unaffected by the challenge test dose (p = 0.54). Conclusions: The main determinants of variation in the L-dopa response in early PD are age and motor severity. A limited L-dopa response is associated with faster motor progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["L-dopa", "Parkinson's disease", "Therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Antiparkinson Agents", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Levodopa", "Male", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065610468", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36727900800": {"Name": "Malek N.", "AuthorID": "36727900800", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57208723461": {"Name": "Kanavou S.", "AuthorID": "57208723461", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "55599815100": {"Name": "Lawton M.A.", "AuthorID": "55599815100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "57218682628": {"Name": "Ben-Shlomo Y.", "AuthorID": "57218682628", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "57208719701": {"Name": "Pitz V.", "AuthorID": "57208719701", "AffiliationID": "60117212", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "6506382805": {"Name": "Grosset K.A.", "AuthorID": "6506382805", "AffiliationID": "60117212", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "7005989891": {"Name": "Grosset D.G.", "AuthorID": "7005989891", "AffiliationID": "60117212", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "6603851732": {"Name": "Bajaj N.", "AuthorID": "6603851732", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Nottingham"}, "57198363260": {"Name": "Barker R.A.", "AuthorID": "57198363260", "AffiliationID": "60120904", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair"}, "26034521700": {"Name": "Burn D.J.", "AuthorID": "26034521700", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Newcastle"}, "57215196433": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "57215196433", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57207702422": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "57207702422", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Laboratories, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7402772034": {"Name": "Williams N.M.", "AuthorID": "7402772034", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Cardiff University"}, "7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
