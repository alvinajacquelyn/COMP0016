Here, we propose to use levitated particles above these displays to enrich the presented information. By means of acoustic or magnetic levitation we show that it is possible to move a particle in mid-air in the space above these displays. We present different configurations that are feasible with current technology, as well as use cases. In this demo, the visitors will be able to explore and interact with various levitators integrated with traditional displays.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic Levitation", "Magnetic Levitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["A-particles", "Acoustic levitation", "Current technology", "Daily lives"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034760836", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"37006934700": {"Name": "Marzo A.", "AuthorID": "37006934700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, Bristol University"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University of Sussex"}, "7006891244": {"Name": "Drinkwater B.", "AuthorID": "7006891244", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, Bristol University"}}}
