Here, we report a robust strategy based on density functional theory for studying these interactions, which has been applied to the highly charged lacunary [PW11O39]7- (PW11) adsorbed on gold and silver surfaces. In this context, we find that, unlike the modeling of polyoxoanions in solution, the incorporation of counterions in the computational models is crucial for accurately reproducing the properties of the system, even if an implicit solvent is used. Most interestingly, we find that the PW11 cluster does not preferentially adsorb to the gold surface via its more nucleophilic monodefect face but, rather, through less negatively charged terminal oxygen ligands, with an orientation similar to that found for the nondefective Keggin anion [SiW12O40]4-, induced by the strong anion-cation interactions from the same and neighboring units. This counterintuitive result is important for ongoing efforts to understand and utilize the properties of polyoxometalate monolayers on gold and other reactive metal surfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017016624", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"55227246600": {"Name": "Lang Z.", "AuthorID": "55227246600", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica i Inorg\u00e0nica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili"}, "7003529284": {"Name": "Clotet A.", "AuthorID": "7003529284", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica i Inorg\u00e0nica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili"}, "7006700175": {"Name": "Poblet J.", "AuthorID": "7006700175", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica i Inorg\u00e0nica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili"}, "57193753001": {"Name": "Aparicio-Angl\u00e8s X.", "AuthorID": "57193753001", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003892343": {"Name": "Weinstock I.", "AuthorID": "7003892343", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}}}
