Our neutron diffraction study confirms long-range magnetic order of Pr below TN = 4.5 K in this compound. Subsequent magnetic structure estimation reveals a magnetic propagation vector K = (1/2 0 1/2) with a magnetic moment value of 2.5\u03bcB/Pr along the orthorhombic c-axis and evidence the lack of ordering in the Fe sublattice. The inelastic neutron scattering study reveals one crystalline electric field excitation near 19 meV at 5 K in PrFe2Al8. The energy-integrated intensity of the 19 meV excitation as a function |Q|(\u00c5-1)of follows the square of the magnetic form factor of Pr3+ thereby confirming that the inelastic excitation belongs to the Pr sublattice. The second sum rule applied to the dynamic structure factor indicates only 1.6(2)\u03bcB evolving at the 19 meV peak compared to the 3.58 \u03bcB for free Pr3+, indicating that the crystal field ground state is magnetic and the missing moment is associated with the resolution limited quasi-elastic line. The magnetic order occurring in Pr in PrFe2Al8 is counter-intuitive to the symmetry-allowed crystal field level scheme, hence, is suggestive of exchange-mediated mechanisms of ordering stemming from the magnetic ground state of the crystal field levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiferromagnetic ordering", "crystal field effect", "inelastic neutron scattering", "Pr", "quasi skutterudite", "singlet"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiferromagnetic orderings", "Crystal field effects", "Crystalline electric fields", "Long range magnetic order", "Neutron diffraction studies", "quasi skutterudite", "singlet", "Three dimensional network structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027342279", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"54412814700": {"Name": "Nair H.S.", "AuthorID": "54412814700", "AffiliationID": "60009226", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Colorado State University"}, "57195346186": {"Name": "Ogunbunmi M.O.", "AuthorID": "57195346186", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Highly Correlated Matter Research Group, Physics Department, University of Johannesburg"}, "7005471548": {"Name": "Adroja D.T.", "AuthorID": "7005471548", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7005613787": {"Name": "Strydom A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005613787", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Highly Correlated Matter Research Group, Physics Department, University of Johannesburg"}, "26221230400": {"Name": "Kumar C.M.N.", "AuthorID": "26221230400", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60024614", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire National des Champs Magn\u00e9tiques Intenses, CNRS-INSA-UJF-UPS"}, "56224800100": {"Name": "Manuel P.", "AuthorID": "56224800100", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7004475745": {"Name": "Fortes D.", "AuthorID": "7004475745", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "55487791800": {"Name": "Taylor J.", "AuthorID": "55487791800", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
