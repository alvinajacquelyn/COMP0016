Ca2+ signaling acquired more extensive and varied functions when life evolved into multicellular eukaryotes with intracellular organelles. Animals, fungi and plants display differences in the mechanisms that control cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations. The aim of this review is to examine recent findings from comparative genomics of Ca2+ signaling molecules in close unicellular relatives of animals and in common unicellular ancestors of animals and fungi. Also discussed are the evolution and origins of the sperm-specific CatSper channel complex, cation/Ca2+ exchangers and four-domain voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Newly identified evolutionary evidence suggests that the distinct Ca2+ signaling machineries in animals, plants and fungi likely originated from an ancient Ca2+ signaling machinery prior to early eukaryotic radiation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium channels", "Calcium signaling", "Choanoflagellates", "Evolution", "Genomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Calcium Signaling", "Eukaryota", "Fungi", "Phylogeny", "Plants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924080589", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7401848244": {"Name": "Cai X.", "AuthorID": "7401848244", "AffiliationID": "60028970", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School"}, "37666291600": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "37666291600", "AffiliationID": "60028970", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nutrition, Department of Medicine, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School"}, "7403902620": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403902620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "35448344600": {"Name": "Clapham D.", "AuthorID": "35448344600", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School"}}}
