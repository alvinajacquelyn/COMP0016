Methods: A two-arm cluster randomized controlled feasibility trial was conducted. Twelve dental practices were recruited and randomized to intervention and control arms. Participants attending for a dental check were recruited into the study and were eligible if they consumed alcohol above recommended levels assessed by the AUDIT-C screening tool. All eligible participants were asked to complete a baseline socio-demographic questionnaire. Six months after the completion of baseline measures, participants were contacted via telephone by a researcher masked to their allocation status. The full AUDIT tool was then administered. Alcohol consumption in the last 90 days was also assessed using the Form 90. A process evaluation assessed the acceptability of the intervention. Results: Over a 7-month period, 229 participants were recruited (95.4% recruitment rate) and at the 6 months follow-up, 176 participants were assessed (76.9% retention rate). At the follow-up, participants in the intervention arm were significantly more likely to report a longer abstinence period (3.2 vs. 2.3 weeks respectively, P = 0.04) and non-significant differences in AUDIT (44.9% vs. 59.8% AUDIT positive respectively, P = 0.053) and AUDIT C difference between baseline and follow-up (-0.67 units vs. -0.29 units respectively, P = 0.058). Results from the process evaluation indicated that the intervention and study procedures were acceptable to dentists and patients. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of dentists screening for alcohol misuse and providing brief advice.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholism", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Counseling", "Dentistry", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066163751", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55796159900": {"Name": "Ntouva A.", "AuthorID": "55796159900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "7403426801": {"Name": "Porter J.", "AuthorID": "7403426801", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "20133865900": {"Name": "Britton A.", "AuthorID": "20133865900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "57220315698": {"Name": "Gratus C.", "AuthorID": "57220315698", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "56179387000": {"Name": "Heilmann A.", "AuthorID": "56179387000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}, "57203219698": {"Name": "Crawford M.J.", "AuthorID": "57203219698", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "35606052400": {"Name": "Newton T.", "AuthorID": "35606052400", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London Dental Institute, Kings College London"}}}
