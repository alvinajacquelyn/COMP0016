Rodent-based studies show that activity-dependent transcriptional programs mediate myriad functions in neuronal development, but the extent of their conservation in human neurons is unknown. We compared activity-dependent transcriptional responses in developing human stem cell-derived cortical neurons with those induced in developing primary- or stem cell-derived mouse cortical neurons. While activity-dependent gene-responsiveness showed little dependence on developmental stage or origin (primary tissue vs. stem cell), notable species-dependent differences were observed. Moreover, differential species-specific gene ortholog regulation was recapitulated in aneuploid mouse neurons carrying human chromosome-21, implicating promoter/enhancer sequence divergence as a factor, including human-specific activity-responsive AP-1 sites. These findings support the use of human neuronal systems for probing transcriptional responses to physiological stimuli or indeed pharmaceutical agents.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Cells, Cultured", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Mice", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurons", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994592368", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55780283400": {"Name": "Qiu J.", "AuthorID": "55780283400", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "54581325100": {"Name": "McQueen J.", "AuthorID": "54581325100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56385990600": {"Name": "Dando O.", "AuthorID": "56385990600", "AffiliationID": "60005502", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain Development and Repair, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, National Centre for Biological Sciences"}, "17343900700": {"Name": "Livesey M.", "AuthorID": "17343900700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "55627930300": {"Name": "Haghi G.", "AuthorID": "55627930300", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "56385148100": {"Name": "Rajan R.", "AuthorID": "56385148100", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "7101743296": {"Name": "Kind P.C.", "AuthorID": "7101743296", "AffiliationID": "60005502", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain Development and Repair, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, National Centre for Biological Sciences"}, "7004236430": {"Name": "Wyllie D.J.A.", "AuthorID": "7004236430", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "6603009103": {"Name": "Hardingham G.E.", "AuthorID": "6603009103", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "6505867146": {"Name": "Bilican B.", "AuthorID": "6505867146", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "36632773900": {"Name": "Magnani D.", "AuthorID": "36632773900", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "57140854400": {"Name": "Punovuori K.", "AuthorID": "57140854400", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "55484411800": {"Name": "Selvaraj B.T.", "AuthorID": "55484411800", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "7003865887": {"Name": "Burr K.", "AuthorID": "7003865887", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "16302224400": {"Name": "Patani R.", "AuthorID": "16302224400", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "57203632312": {"Name": "Lowell S.", "AuthorID": "57203632312", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "7004332041": {"Name": "Chandran S.", "AuthorID": "7004332041", "AffiliationID": "60005502", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain Development and Repair, Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, National Centre for Biological Sciences"}, "57130355100": {"Name": "Heron S.", "AuthorID": "57130355100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh"}, "7202539138": {"Name": "Simpson T.I.", "AuthorID": "7202539138", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh"}, "16417851300": {"Name": "Sheppard O.", "AuthorID": "16417851300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203069236": {"Name": "Fisher E.M.C.", "AuthorID": "57203069236", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003735726": {"Name": "Tybulewicz V.L.J.", "AuthorID": "7003735726", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College"}}}
