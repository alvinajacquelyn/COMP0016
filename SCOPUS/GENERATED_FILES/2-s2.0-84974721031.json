We aimed to undertake a systematic review and meta-Analysis of the randomised controlled trial (RCT) data behind such guidelines to identify the most efficacious treatment regimens. Ovid MEDLINE, the Web of Science and EMBASE were mined using search terms for TB, drug therapy and RCTs. Despite 12 604 records being retrieved, only three studies reported treatment outcomes by regimen for patients with non-MDR RMP-R disease, preventing meta-Analysis. Our systematic review highlights a substantial gap in the literature regarding evidence-based treatment regimens for RMP-R TB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Monoresistance", "Randomized controlled trials", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibiotics, Antitubercular", "Biomedical Research", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Professional Practice Gaps", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Rifampin", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974721031", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55201612700": {"Name": "Stagg H.R.", "AuthorID": "55201612700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}, "57189702305": {"Name": "Hatherell H.A.", "AuthorID": "57189702305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) CoMPLEX, Faculty of Mathematics and Physical Sciences"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.C.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "15073716700": {"Name": "Harris R.J.", "AuthorID": "15073716700", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Modelling and Economics Department, Public Health England"}}}
