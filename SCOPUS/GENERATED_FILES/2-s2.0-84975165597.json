The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.In an effort to measure the masses of planets discovered by the NASA K2 mission, we have conducted precise Doppler observations of five stars with transiting planets. We present the results of a joint analysis of these new data and previously published Doppler data. The first star, an M dwarf known as K2-3 or EPIC 201367065, has three transiting planets (\"b,\" with radius \"c,\" and \"d,\" ). Our analysis leads to the mass constraints: And M c < 4.2 M \u2295 (95% confidence). The mass of planet d is poorly constrained because its orbital period is close to the stellar rotation period, making it difficult to disentangle the planetary signal from spurious Doppler shifts due to stellar activity. The second star, a G dwarf known as K2-19 or EPIC 201505350, has two planets (\"b,\" 7.7 R \u2295; and \"c,\" 4.9 R \u2295) in a 3:2 mean-motion resonance, as well as a shorter-period planet (\"d,\" 1.1 R \u2295). We find M b = , M c = and M d < 14.0 M \u2295 (95% conf.). The third star, a G dwarf known as K2-24 or EPIC 203771098, hosts two transiting planets (\"b,\" 5.7 R \u2295; and \"c,\" 7.8 R \u2295) with orbital periods in a nearly 2:1 ratio. We find M b = and M c = . The fourth star, a G dwarf known as EPIC 204129699, hosts a hot Jupiter for which we measured the mass to be . The fifth star, a G dwarf known as EPIC 205071984, contains three transiting planets (\"b,\" 5.4 R \u2295; \"c,\" 3.5 R \u2295; and \"d,\" 3.8 R \u2295), the outer two of which have a nearly 2:1 period ratio. We find M b = , M c < (95% conf.) and M d < 35 M \u2295 (95% conf.).", "AuthorKeywords": ["planetary systems", "planets and satellites: composition", "techniques: radial velocities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975165597", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56939943400": {"Name": "Dai F.", "AuthorID": "56939943400", "AffiliationID": "60103460, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "35514528300": {"Name": "Winn J.", "AuthorID": "35514528300", "AffiliationID": "60103460, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "55535021700": {"Name": "Van Eylen V.", "AuthorID": "55535021700", "AffiliationID": "60024613", "AffiliationName": "Carnegie Institution of Washington, Department of Terrestrial Magnetism"}, "56939492800": {"Name": "Yu L.", "AuthorID": "56939492800", "AffiliationID": "60103460, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "15126741200": {"Name": "Albrecht S.", "AuthorID": "15126741200", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Stellar Astrophysics Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}, "57213470828": {"Name": "Kiilerich A.", "AuthorID": "57213470828", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Stellar Astrophysics Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}, "23391800200": {"Name": "Arriagada P.", "AuthorID": "23391800200", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics"}, "36010534500": {"Name": "Bieryla A.", "AuthorID": "36010534500", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics"}, "35316867300": {"Name": "Butler R.", "AuthorID": "35316867300", "AffiliationID": "60024613", "AffiliationName": "Carnegie Institution of Washington, Department of Terrestrial Magnetism"}, "35474248300": {"Name": "Johnson J.", "AuthorID": "35474248300", "AffiliationID": "60024613", "AffiliationName": "Carnegie Institution of Washington, Department of Terrestrial Magnetism"}, "7005728210": {"Name": "Latham D.", "AuthorID": "7005728210", "AffiliationID": "60024613", "AffiliationName": "Carnegie Institution of Washington, Department of Terrestrial Magnetism"}, "36634855200": {"Name": "Teske J.", "AuthorID": "36634855200", "AffiliationID": "60002312", "AffiliationName": "Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington"}, "7202061515": {"Name": "Crane J.", "AuthorID": "7202061515", "AffiliationID": "60002312", "AffiliationName": "Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington"}, "6701721082": {"Name": "Shectman S.", "AuthorID": "6701721082", "AffiliationID": "60002312", "AffiliationName": "Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington"}, "57203053536": {"Name": "Thompson I.", "AuthorID": "57203053536", "AffiliationID": "60002312", "AffiliationName": "Observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington"}, "55456655900": {"Name": "Hirano T.", "AuthorID": "55456655900", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "8872076300": {"Name": "Narita N.", "AuthorID": "8872076300", "AffiliationID": "60021523", "AffiliationName": "SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies)"}, "36938030400": {"Name": "Nowak G.", "AuthorID": "36938030400", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de la Laguna (ULL)"}, "57188660772": {"Name": "Palle E.", "AuthorID": "57188660772", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de la Laguna (ULL)"}, "7003372967": {"Name": "Ribas I.", "AuthorID": "7003372967", "AffiliationID": "60103733, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Ci\u00e8ncies de l'Espai (CSIC-IEEC), Carrer de Can Magrans, Campus UAB"}, "43361838900": {"Name": "Rogers L.", "AuthorID": "43361838900", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Science, University of California"}, "36864449700": {"Name": "Sanchis-Ojeda R.", "AuthorID": "36864449700", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of California"}, "35303900100": {"Name": "Wittenmyer R.", "AuthorID": "35303900100", "AffiliationID": "60020321", "AffiliationName": "Computational Engineering and Science Research Centre, University of Southern Queensland"}}}
