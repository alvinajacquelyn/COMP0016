Policy-making focuses on such interventions, mainly from medical-pharmacological and hi-tech perspectives, such as advancements in pharmaceuticals, wearable technologies and e-health applications or robotics. Aspects of the built envir-onment\u2014that is, human-made surroundings\u2014are rarely considered worth exploring. Yet, the fact that we have created buildings, as opposed to many advanced technologies that we are yet to invent, does not necessarily make them fit for purpose for the needs of an ageing population. This is the case in all forms and scales of the built environment, from houses to transportation networks. This article argues that policies and interventions for active and healthy ageing could benefit from a broader integration framework that would allow our built surroundings, of all scales and complexities, to become part of the solution. This could be achieved through new architectural and design paradigms that, contrary to prevailing architectural education and practice, operate in harmony with human perceptions and physiology, especially for vulnerable and older adults. By better understanding the consequences of the built environment on the well-being of the older population and acting on this we could, first, prevent the environment being disabling for vulnerable people and, second, hopefully enable increased autonomy through interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064955721", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"57202862542": {"Name": "Chrysikou E.", "AuthorID": "57202862542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Real Estate Institute UCL"}}}
