Prenatal Diagnosis Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: To establish maternal complication rates for fetoscopic or open fetal surgery. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review for studies of fetoscopic or open fetal surgery performed since 1990, recording maternal complications during fetal surgery, the remainder of pregnancy, delivery, and after the index pregnancy. Results: One hundred sixty-six studies were included, reporting outcomes for open fetal (n = 1193 patients) and fetoscopic surgery (n = 9403 patients). No maternal deaths were reported. The risk of any maternal complication in the index pregnancy was 20.9% (95%CI, 15.22-27.13) for open fetal and 6.2% (95%CI, 4.93-7.49) for fetoscopic surgery. For severe maternal complications (grades III to V Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications), the risk was 4.5% (95% CI 3.24-5.98) for open fetal and 1.7% (95% CI, 1.19-2.20) for fetoscopic surgery. In subsequent pregnancies, open fetal surgery increased the risk of preterm birth but not uterine dehiscence or rupture. Nearly one quarter of reviewed studies (n = 175, 23.3%) was excluded for failing to report the presence or absence of maternal complications. Conclusions: Maternal complications occur in 6.2% fetoscopic and 20.9% open fetal surgeries, with serious maternal complications in 1.7% fetoscopic and 4.5% open procedures. Reporting of maternal complications is variable. To properly quantify maternal risks, outcomes should be reported consistently across all fetal surgery studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Fetoscopy", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Mothers", "Open Abdomen Techniques", "Postoperative Complications", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062323283", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57204107671": {"Name": "Sacco A.", "AuthorID": "57204107671", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57207252949": {"Name": "Bagshaw E.", "AuthorID": "57207252949", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57207250770": {"Name": "Ferguson C.", "AuthorID": "57207250770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "55981137300": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "55981137300", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Department Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "57197818957": {"Name": "Van der Veeken L.", "AuthorID": "57197818957", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Development and Regeneration, Cluster Woman and Child, Biomedical Sciences, KU Leuven"}, "14029514100": {"Name": "Van Mieghem T.", "AuthorID": "14029514100", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60006894", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Mount Sinai Hospital and University of Toronto"}}}
