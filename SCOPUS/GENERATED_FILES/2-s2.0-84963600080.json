For one year the information provided in 94 referrals was assessed. Using a predetermined checklist of essential information the referral letters were compared to these set criteria.Results The service received 7,001 referrals and, on average, general dental practitioners (GDPs) referred 303 more patients per year than general medical practitioners (GMPs). Seventy-one percent of all referrals were from primary care practitioners, the rest were from specialists. Over 70% of GMP and 52% of GDP letters included a past medical history, with GMPs more likely to suggest a possible diagnosis and include previous secondary care referrals. The mean score for GMP referrals compared to the standard proforma (maximum of 12) was 5.6 and for GDP referrals 5.0. A relevant drug history was included by 75.6% GMP compared to 38.7% of GDPs. GMPs were more likely to include any relevant mental health history.Conclusions The overall quality of referral letters is low which makes it difficult for the specialists to provide robust treatment plans.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dentists", "Facial Pain", "Humans", "Pain Clinics", "Physicians", "Referral and Consultation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963600080", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57188804129": {"Name": "Lang M.", "AuthorID": "57188804129", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Medical School"}, "57188815130": {"Name": "Selvadurai T.", "AuthorID": "57188815130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Medical School"}, "56810833400": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "56810833400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diagnostic, Surgical and Medical Sciences, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London"}}}
