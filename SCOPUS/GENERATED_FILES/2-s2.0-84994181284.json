Compliance with recognised reporting guidelines for systematic review evidence has not been assessed. Objective To assess the compliance of systematic reviews published in craniofacial journals with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting criteria. Data sources, search terms and study selection Thomson Reuters impact factor was used to identify three top craniofacial journals. A search for all systematic review articles published in these journals from 1st May 2010 to 30th April 2015 was conducted using MEDLINE PubMed. Data extraction Two independent researchers assessed each study for inclusion and performed the data extraction. Data included the article reference information; the pathology and interventions examined and compliance of each review article with the PRISMA checklist. Data synthesis and results 97 studies were returned by the search. 62 studies proceeded to data extraction. The mean percentage of applicable PRISMA items that were met across all studies was 72.5% (range 28.6\u201396.2%). The area of poorest compliance was with the declaration of a study protocol (19.4% of studies). Only 37.1% of studies declared their source of funding. Conclusions Compliance of systematic review articles within craniofacial surgery with areas of the PRISMA checklist could be improved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Craniofacial surgery", "PRISMA", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Guideline Adherence", "Humans", "Orthognathic Surgery", "Periodicals as Topic", "Review Literature as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994181284", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"56258758400": {"Name": "Pidgeon T.E.", "AuthorID": "56258758400", "AffiliationID": "60004202", "AffiliationName": "St. Andrew's Centre for Plastic Surgery and Burns, Broomfield Hospital"}, "56682096700": {"Name": "Wellstead G.", "AuthorID": "56682096700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, QMUL"}, "56384434300": {"Name": "Sagoo H.", "AuthorID": "56384434300", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Guy's King's and St. Thomas' School of Medical Education, King's College London"}, "57105508100": {"Name": "Jafree D.J.", "AuthorID": "57105508100", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "55580179300": {"Name": "Fowler A.J.", "AuthorID": "55580179300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "14625854500": {"Name": "Agha R.A.", "AuthorID": "14625854500", "AffiliationID": "60006892, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Balliol College, University of Oxford"}}}
