Methods: We conducted an online search for guidelines on FNAB of thyroid nodules published between 2013 and October 2018. They were evaluated by four independent reviewers previously trained to apply the AGREE II instrument, which is organized into items and domains. A fifth independent reviewer calculated scores for each domain and guideline as well as inter-appraiser agreement. Results: Six sets of guidelines were included, respectively, provided by the American Thyroid Association (ATA), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology/Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AACE/ACE/AME), the Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology (KSThR), the European Thyroid Association (ETA), the American College of Radiology (ACR) and the Korean Society of Radiology and National Evidence-Based Healthcare Collaborating Agency (KSR/NECA). Five out of the six guidelines (ATA, AACE/ACE/AME, ETA, ACR and KSR/NECA) reached a high level of overall quality, having at least five domain scores >60%. An average level of overall quality was achieved in one case (KSThR recommendations). Inter-appraiser agreement ranged from moderate to excellent. Conclusions: Overall, the quality of guidelines on FNAB of thyroid nodules is satisfactory when evaluated using the AGREE II instrument.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AGREE", "Evidence-based medicine", "Fine needle aspiration", "Guideline", "Thyroid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biopsy, Fine-Needle", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Quality Assurance, Health Care", "Thyroid Nodule"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069688591", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57188980176": {"Name": "Gitto S.", "AuthorID": "57188980176", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduation School in Radiodiagnostics, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "57201441370": {"Name": "Emili I.", "AuthorID": "57201441370", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduation School in Radiodiagnostics, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "57198512669": {"Name": "Nicosia L.", "AuthorID": "57198512669", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduation School in Radiodiagnostics, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "36570712200": {"Name": "Pescatori L.C.", "AuthorID": "36570712200", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduation School in Radiodiagnostics, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}, "7202401507": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "7202401507", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "6701750965": {"Name": "Lingam R.K.", "AuthorID": "6701750965", "AffiliationID": "60189083, 60105470", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Northwick Park & Central Middlesex Hospitals, London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7006400410": {"Name": "Sardanelli F.", "AuthorID": "7006400410", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche per la Salute, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "24448438200": {"Name": "Sconfienza L.M.", "AuthorID": "24448438200", "AffiliationID": "60084910", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Galeazzi"}, "36197107500": {"Name": "Mauri G.", "AuthorID": "36197107500", "AffiliationID": "60030442", "AffiliationName": "Divisione di Radiologia Interventistica, IRCCS Istituto Europeo di Oncologia"}}}
