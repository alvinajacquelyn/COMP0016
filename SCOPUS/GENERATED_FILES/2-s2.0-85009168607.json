The samples were processed using the standard acetic acid method, which extracts foraminifera from lithified carbonate rocks without destroying the fossil content. The foraminiferal assemblages from the Dam Formation are dominated by calcareous porcelaneous Miliolina (Quinqueloculina, Peneroplis, Triloculina, Cornuspira, Sigmoilinita, Coscinospira, Spirolina, Pyrgo, Borelis), followed by hyaline genera (Elphidium sp., Ammonia, Cibicides, Discorbinella) and a minor percentage of agglutinated forms, e.g., Textularina. The high percentage of calcareous porcelaneous taxa and the absence of planktonic foraminifera indicate that the Dam Formation was deposited in a restricted carbonate platform environment, very shallow hypersaline shallow marine, gently sloping ramp (inner ramp to mid ramp) which ranges from supratidal to subtidal with local reef patches towards the basin. The formation was deposited in an arid subtropical climatic environment with water temperatures ranging from 20 to 35 \u00b0C. Based on the observed assemblage composition, the present day Arabian Gulf can be considered as a modern analogue for the Dam Formation during Miocene times.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benthic foraminifera", "Dam Formation", "Eastern Saudi Arabia", "Morphogroups", "Shallow marine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009168607", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57085629800": {"Name": "Chan S.A.", "AuthorID": "57085629800", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Geosciences Department, Research Group on Reservoir Characterization, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}, "7202547764": {"Name": "Kaminski M.A.", "AuthorID": "7202547764", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Geosciences Department, Research Group on Reservoir Characterization, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}, "57204422977": {"Name": "Al-Ramadan K.", "AuthorID": "57204422977", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Geosciences Department, Research Group on Reservoir Characterization, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}, "7801510731": {"Name": "Babalola L.O.", "AuthorID": "7801510731", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Center of Integrative Petroleum Research, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}}}
