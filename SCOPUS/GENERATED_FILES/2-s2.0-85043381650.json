Structured interviews were conducted on 2,980 participants. Data were then linked with information drawn from Danish registries. Multinomial logistic regression analyses indicated out-of-home-care was a shared risk for all forms of maltreatment relative to nonmaltreated controls. Sexual and co-occurring abuse groups had strong associations with psychiatric outcomes at age 21. Findings emphasize how a child\u2019s early environment can impact health, highlighting the need for targeted interventions encompassing a range of risk factors at an early age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child maltreatment", "data linkage", "latent class analysis", "validation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043381650", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57210504546": {"Name": "Murphy S.", "AuthorID": "57210504546", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Psychotraumatology, Institute of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense"}, "6701419964": {"Name": "Elklit A.", "AuthorID": "6701419964", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "National Centre of Psychotraumatology, Institute of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense"}, "7004128606": {"Name": "Shevlin M.", "AuthorID": "7004128606", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Psychology Research Institute, Ulster University, Derry"}, "7404113856": {"Name": "Murphy J.", "AuthorID": "7404113856", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Psychology Research Institute, Ulster University, Derry"}, "56079814100": {"Name": "McElroy E.", "AuthorID": "56079814100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Liverpool"}, "55113504900": {"Name": "Hyland P.", "AuthorID": "55113504900", "AffiliationID": "60104048", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, National College of Ireland"}, "7003400084": {"Name": "Christoffersen M.", "AuthorID": "7003400084", "AffiliationID": "60070866", "AffiliationName": "Danish Centre for Social Research"}}}
