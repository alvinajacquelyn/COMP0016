The advantages of using this sensing principle are the low manufacturing costs, the simple fabrication, and the immunity to electrical noise. The force/torque sensor makes use of six optical sensors: each sensor measures the displacement of a reflective surface that moves integrally with a simply-supported beam. The proposed mechanical structure allows for a variety of shapes on the mechanical structure to be easily adaptable to many robot applications. In this paper, we present a five-axis force/torque sensor based on this optoelectronic principle. To measure force/torque components, two identical three-DoF force/torque sensor structures (comprised of three beams) are mounted on top of each other. Photo sensors and mirrors are fixed inside the structure to measure the six beam deflections. In this paper, we describe the sensor structure, design, fabrication, calibration, and verify our sensor development methodology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Force/torque sensor", "Manufacturing cost", "Mechanical structures", "Multi-axis force/torque sensors", "Optoelectronic technology", "Reflective surfaces", "Sensor development", "Simply supported beams"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006351783", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56637802700": {"Name": "Noh Y.", "AuthorID": "56637802700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55512143700": {"Name": "Bimbo J.", "AuthorID": "55512143700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "56423623500": {"Name": "Stilli A.", "AuthorID": "56423623500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "55719408400": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "55719408400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "6701489118": {"Name": "Althoefer K.", "AuthorID": "6701489118", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, King's College London"}, "35119695800": {"Name": "Wurdemann H.", "AuthorID": "35119695800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "15042114800": {"Name": "Housden J.", "AuthorID": "15042114800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "9245867600": {"Name": "Rhode K.", "AuthorID": "9245867600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}}}
