The focus is on a possibility of transient amplification of perturbations. It is shown that, depending on the coefficients in the governing equations, transient growth may appear in both asymptotically stable and unstable situations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Linear instability", "Schnakenberg model", "Transient growth"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920855839", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56479289800": {"Name": "Al-Zarka A.", "AuthorID": "56479289800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Nonlinear Analysis and Applied Mathematics Research Group (NAAM), Department of Mathematics, King Abdulaziz University"}, "55998353800": {"Name": "Alagha A.", "AuthorID": "55998353800", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Nonlinear Analysis and Applied Mathematics Research Group (NAAM), Department of Mathematics, King Abdulaziz University"}, "7006275421": {"Name": "Timoshin S.", "AuthorID": "7006275421", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, UCL"}}}
