We report the outcomes of 295 patients with systemic AL amyloidosis \u226575 years seen at the UK National Amyloidosis Centre from 2005-2012. The median age was 78.5 years. The median overall survival was 20 months. Two hundred and thirty-eight patients received chemotherapy and 57 elected for supportive care only (overall survival \u2013 24 and 8.4 months, respectively). On intention-totreat analysis, 44% achieved a hematologic response including a very good partial response or better in 23%. The median overall survival was 6.2 years in patients achieving very good partial response or better at the 6-month landmark analysis and 1.5 years in non-responders. Factors independently indicating a poor prognosis were: cardiac involvement, performance status \u22652; systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg and, on landmark analysis, achieving less than a very good partial response. Treatment of systemic AL amyloidosis in the elderly is challenging. Deep clonal responses are associated with excellent survival and organ responses. Achieving a response to the first-line regimen appears particularly important as outcomes of non-responders are similar to those of untreated patients. Prospective trials with lower toxicity, outpatient treatment regimens are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloidosis", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946204512", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"55621355900": {"Name": "Sachchithanantham S.", "AuthorID": "55621355900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "50361564300": {"Name": "Mahmood S.A.", "AuthorID": "50361564300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "55215439900": {"Name": "Foard D.", "AuthorID": "55215439900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "55214965100": {"Name": "Rannigan L.", "AuthorID": "55214965100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "41861760800": {"Name": "Lane T.", "AuthorID": "41861760800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.D.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, University College London"}, "12042427900": {"Name": "Offer M.", "AuthorID": "12042427900", "AffiliationID": "60176242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55215063800": {"Name": "Venner C.", "AuthorID": "55215063800", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60020048", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta, Cross Cancer Institute"}}}
