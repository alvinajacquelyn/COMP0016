Thin layers of paint originating from multiple restoration processes often applied over many centuries have been analysed non-destructively using micro-SORS to depths inaccessible to, or unresolvable into separate layers, by conventional confocal Raman microscopy. The concept has been demonstrated on several artistic artefacts of historical significance originating from Italy and dating from the medieval to the 18th century. The technique extends the depth applicability of Raman spectroscopy and with its inherently high chemical specificity that expands the portfolio of existing non-destructive analytical tools in Cultural Heritage permitting to avoid cross-sectional analysis often necessitated with this type of samples with conventional Raman microscopy. Currently, the method is non-invasive only for artworks that can be placed under Raman microscope although there is a prospect for its use in a mobile system with largely removed restrictions on sample dimensions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["non-destructive", "plasters", "sculptures", "spatially offset Raman spectroscopy", "subsurface"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027922261", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"35395864300": {"Name": "Conti C.", "AuthorID": "35395864300", "AffiliationID": "60023223, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Istituto per la Conservazione e la Valorizzazione Dei Beni Culturali (ICVBC)"}, "56979460300": {"Name": "Colombo C.", "AuthorID": "56979460300", "AffiliationID": "60023223, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Istituto per la Conservazione e la Valorizzazione Dei Beni Culturali (ICVBC)"}, "6602126191": {"Name": "Realini M.", "AuthorID": "6602126191", "AffiliationID": "60023223, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche, Istituto per la Conservazione e la Valorizzazione Dei Beni Culturali (ICVBC)"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
