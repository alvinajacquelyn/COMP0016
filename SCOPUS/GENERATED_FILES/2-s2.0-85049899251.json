Neuronal excitotoxicity which is induced by exposure to excessive extracellular glutamate is shown to be involved in neuronal cell death in acute brain injury and a number of neurological diseases. High concentration of glutamate induces calcium deregulation which results in mitochondrial calcium overload and mitochondrial depolarization that triggers the mechanism of cell death. Inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uptake could be potentially neuroprotective but complete inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uniporter could result in the loss of some physiological processes linked to Ca 2+ in mitochondria. Here, we found that a novel compound, TG-2112x, can inhibit only the lower concentrations mitochondrial calcium uptake (induced by 100 nM-5 \u03bcM) but not the uptake induced by higher concentrations of calcium (10 \u03bcM and higher). This effect was not associated with changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular respiration. However, a pre-treatment of neurons with TG-2112x protected the neurons against calcium overload upon application of toxic concentrations of glutamate. Thus, sequestration of mitochondrial calcium uptake protected the neurons against glutamate-induced mitochondrial depolarization and cell death. In our hands, TG-2112x was also protective against ionomycin-induced cell death. Hence, low rate mitochondrial calcium uptake plays an underestimated role in mitochondrial function, and its inhibition could protect neurons against calcium overload and cell death in glutamate excitotoxicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium", "Excitotoxicity", "Glutamate", "Glutamate", "Mitochondria", "Neuron"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels", "Glutamic Acid", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Mitochondria", "Neurons", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Rats, Wistar"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049899251", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56081167500": {"Name": "Angelova P.", "AuthorID": "56081167500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55991594700": {"Name": "Vinogradova D.", "AuthorID": "55991594700", "AffiliationID": "60109762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "49864350200": {"Name": "Neganova M.", "AuthorID": "49864350200", "AffiliationID": "60109762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "6603076070": {"Name": "Serkova T.", "AuthorID": "6603076070", "AffiliationID": "60109762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "55587792500": {"Name": "Sokolov V.", "AuthorID": "55587792500", "AffiliationID": "60109762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7007087179": {"Name": "Bachurin S.", "AuthorID": "7007087179", "AffiliationID": "60109762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "6603104862": {"Name": "Shevtsova E.", "AuthorID": "6603104862", "AffiliationID": "60109762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiologically Active Compounds Russian Academy of Sciences"}}}
