We describe unusually severe adverse reactions to pneumococcal vaccination in each of 7 consecutive patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Methods Seven consecutive patients with CAPS were vaccinated with pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines. Clinical information was collected retrospectively. Results Within a few hours after the vaccination, all 7 patients developed severe local reactions at the injection site. Two patients had to be hospitalized for systemic reactions including fever. All symptoms resolved in a period of 3-17 days. Conclusion Our findings indicate that pneumococcal vaccines can trigger a severe local and systemic inflammatory reaction in patients with CAPS and possibly patients with other autoinflammatory diseases. Careful consideration is warranted when implementing current European League Against Rheumatism immunization guidelines in this patient population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes", "Female", "Fever", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Inflammation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Pneumococcal Vaccines", "Retrospective Studies", "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956767664", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7003907112": {"Name": "Walker U.", "AuthorID": "7003907112", "AffiliationID": "115805731", "AffiliationName": "Unispital Basel, Department of Rheumatology"}, "7201677513": {"Name": "Hoffman H.", "AuthorID": "7201677513", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "University of California at San Diego"}, "57069286700": {"Name": "Williams R.", "AuthorID": "57069286700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7801480375": {"Name": "Kuemmerle-Deschner J.", "AuthorID": "7801480375", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital T\u00fcbingen"}}}
