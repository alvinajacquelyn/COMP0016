All rights reserved.Establishing the phase diagram of hydrogen is a major challenge for experimental and theoretical physics. Experiment alone cannot establish the atomic structure of solid hydrogen at high pressure, because hydrogen scatters X-rays only weakly. Instead, our understanding of the atomic structure is largely based on density functional theory (DFT). By comparing Raman spectra for low-energy structures found in DFT searches with experimental spectra, candidate atomic structures have been identified for each experimentally observed phase. Unfortunately, DFT predicts a metallic structure to be energetically favoured at a broad range of pressures up to 400 GPa, where it is known experimentally that hydrogen is non-metallic. Here we show that more advanced theoretical methods (diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations) find the metallic structure to be uncompetitive, and predict a phase diagram in reasonable agreement with experiment. This greatly strengthens the claim that the candidate atomic structures accurately model the experimentally observed phases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938099027", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8241383700": {"Name": "Drummond N.", "AuthorID": "8241383700", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "36656197000": {"Name": "Monserrat B.", "AuthorID": "36656197000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Theory of Condensed Matter Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55199568900": {"Name": "Lloyd-Williams J.", "AuthorID": "55199568900", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Theory of Condensed Matter Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "14016120800": {"Name": "R\u00edos P.", "AuthorID": "14016120800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Theory of Condensed Matter Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7003406428": {"Name": "Needs R.", "AuthorID": "7003406428", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Theory of Condensed Matter Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7006725779": {"Name": "Pickard C.", "AuthorID": "7006725779", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
