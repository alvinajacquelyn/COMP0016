Thus far, these techniques have been applied mainly to 2D or 2.5D data, but their application to 3D 360\u00b0 data is promising and still underdeveloped. Here, we apply new 3D techniques to calculate morphometric variables and to analyse surficial features and changes in pounding stone tools used for baobab processing among Hadza foragers of Tanzania. Baobab pounding stones were collected after use by Hadza foragers for processing the plant food and then 3D point clouds were acquired from laser scanners and SfM photogrammetry. Morphometry was conducted directly on 3D point clouds to avoid time-consuming and surface modifications related to more complex 3D data, such as meshing. Several morphometric variables were computed for the complete pieces (360\u00b0 sphere) providing fast and accurate data to identify the detailed morphometric features of the artefacts. Additionally, stone surface changes due to baobab processing were measured by comparing the stone surface before and after use, thus enabling calculation of spatial abrasion patterns. Data were interpreted using multivariate exploratory statistical analysis. Differences in the effect of processing on surface morphology are likely explained by variations in raw source material and use. Results suggest that the traces produced by baobab processing on stone tools should be detectable in the archaeological record.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D surface morphometry", "Baobab processing", "Multivariate exploratory statistics", "Pounding stone tools", "Use wear"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048432734", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"16425343900": {"Name": "Benito-Calvo A.", "AuthorID": "16425343900", "AffiliationID": "60113906", "AffiliationName": "CENIEH"}, "56719627900": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Romero L.", "AuthorID": "56719627900", "AffiliationID": "60022866", "AffiliationName": "Doctorado Interuniversitario de Evoluci\u00f3n Humana, Paleoecolog\u00eda del Cuaternario y T\u00e9cnicas Geof\u00edsicas Aplicadas a la Investigaci\u00f3n, Universidad de Burgos"}, "57201737523": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Fern\u00e1ndez A.", "AuthorID": "57201737523", "AffiliationID": "60113906", "AffiliationName": "CENIEH"}, "24464862500": {"Name": "Crittenden A.", "AuthorID": "24464862500", "AffiliationID": "60031892", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Nevada"}, "55657955100": {"Name": "Livengood S.", "AuthorID": "55657955100", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Arkansas"}, "6602367706": {"Name": "de la Torre I.", "AuthorID": "6602367706", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "21733442900": {"Name": "Pante M.", "AuthorID": "21733442900", "AffiliationID": "60009226", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Colorado State University"}}}
