American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Although the particle carriers of field-aligned currents (FACs) in the Earth's magnetotail play an important role in the transfer of momentum and energy between the solar wind, magnetosphere, and ionosphere, the characteristics of the FAC carriers have been poorly understood. Taking advantage of multiinstrument magnetic field and plasma data collected by the four spacecraft of the Cluster constellation as they traversed the northern plasma sheet boundary layer in the magnetotail on 14 September 2004, we identified the species type and energy range of the FAC carriers for the first time. The results indicate that part of tailward FACs is carried by energetic keV ions, which are probably originated from the ionosphere through outflow, and they are not too small (\u223c2 nA/m2) to be ignored. The earthward (tailward) FACs are mainly carried by the dominant tailward (earthward) motion of electrons, and higher-energy electrons (from \u223c0.5 to 26 keV) are the main carriers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["current carriers", "field-aligned currents", "magnetotail", "plasma sheet boundary layer", "substorm"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964317442", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"8449594700": {"Name": "Cheng Z.W.", "AuthorID": "8449594700", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center, University of New Hampshire"}, "7404494774": {"Name": "Shi J.K.", "AuthorID": "7404494774", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, NSSC/CAS"}, "54384568200": {"Name": "Zhang J.C.", "AuthorID": "54384568200", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center, University of New Hampshire"}, "7003373791": {"Name": "Kistler L.M.", "AuthorID": "7003373791", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center, University of New Hampshire"}, "55414914100": {"Name": "Dunlop M.", "AuthorID": "55414914100", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "SSTD, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "13406850000": {"Name": "Dandouras I.", "AuthorID": "13406850000", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60123782, 60008134, 60102124", "AffiliationName": "University of Toulouse, UPS, IRAP, CNRS"}, "19034267700": {"Name": "Fazakerley A.", "AuthorID": "19034267700", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MSSL, University College London"}}}
