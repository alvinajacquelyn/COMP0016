The field of urban studies is yet to deeply engage in the debates on the new forms of cross national networking that are potentially framing and reframing urban governance and strategy. Yet this dimension of urban governance can no longer go unnoticed. In this article we draw together insights from the extant literature into a research agenda on reconfiguring urban governance. We propose a research agenda centred on three themes: the political economy of \u2018new-gen\u2019 networks, especially in relation to the role of economic power in determining participation and influence; the knowledge dynamics in city networks in understanding the socio-spatial configurations that are underpinning the decision-making processes and outcomes; and the implications of city networks for traditional institutions that have in the past shaped cities\u2019 strategies, development and government. Our commentary considers and links these emergent themes, noting how these bear serious and urgent consideration for mainstream urban studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["networks", "planning", "policy", "politics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061205071", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"36008251400": {"Name": "Davidson K.", "AuthorID": "36008251400", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "10540364400": {"Name": "Coenen L.", "AuthorID": "10540364400", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "26021005000": {"Name": "Acuto M.", "AuthorID": "26021005000", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}, "25026200700": {"Name": "Gleeson B.", "AuthorID": "25026200700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "University of Melbourne"}}}
