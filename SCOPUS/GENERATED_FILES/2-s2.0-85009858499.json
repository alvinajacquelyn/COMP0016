ELS plays an important role in the development of adolescent depressive symptoms and clinical disorders. Identifying factors that may reduce depressive symptoms in adolescents with ELS may have important public mental health implications. Methods We used structural equation modelling and examined the impact of adolescent friendships and/or family support at age 14 on depressive symptoms at age 17 in adolescents exposed to ELS before age 11. To this end, we used structural equation modelling in a community sample of 771 adolescents (322 boys and 477 girls) from a 3 year longitudinal study. Significant paths in the model were followed-up to test whether social support mediated or moderated the association between ELS and depressive symptoms at age 17. Results We found that adolescent social support in adolescence is negatively associated with subsequent depressive symptoms in boys and girls exposed to ELS. Specifically, we found evidence for two mediational pathways: In the first pathway family support mediated the link between CFA and depressive symptoms at age 17. Specifically, CFA was negatively associated with adolescent family support at age 14, which in turn was negatively associated with depressive symptoms at age 17. In the second pathway we found that adolescent friendships mediated the path between peer bullying and depressive symptoms. Specifically, relational bullying was negatively associated with adolescent friendships at age 14, which in turn were negatively associated with depressive symptoms at age 17. In contrast, we did not find a moderating effect of friendships and family support on the association between CFA and depressive symptoms. Conclusions Friendships and/or family support in adolescence mediate the relationship between ELS and late adolescent depressive symptoms in boys and girls. Therefore, enhancing affiliate relationships and positive family environments may benefit the mental health of vulnerable youth that have experienced CFA and/or primary school bullying.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Bullying", "Crime Victims", "Depression", "Family", "Female", "Friends", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Peer Group", "Risk Factors", "Social Support", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009858499", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35747343700": {"Name": "van Harmelen A.L.", "AuthorID": "35747343700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "36099159900": {"Name": "St Clair M.C.", "AuthorID": "36099159900", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}, "54789977100": {"Name": "Owens M.", "AuthorID": "54789977100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Exeter"}, "6602744071": {"Name": "Brodbeck J.", "AuthorID": "6602744071", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Berne"}, "7003749366": {"Name": "Dunn V.", "AuthorID": "7003749366", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57215788209": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "57215788209", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "6603726577": {"Name": "Croudace T.", "AuthorID": "6603726577", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Health Sciences, University of Dundee"}, "56489064900": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "56489064900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7005728308": {"Name": "Goodyer I.M.", "AuthorID": "7005728308", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57192935110": {"Name": "Gibson J.L.", "AuthorID": "57192935110", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge"}, "57210699786": {"Name": "Kievit R.A.", "AuthorID": "57210699786", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}}}
