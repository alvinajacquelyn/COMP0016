Interleukin (IL)-6 acts as a mediator between pro- and anti-inflammatory reactivity by initiating trans- and classical-signaling, respectively. Hence, IL-6 is assumed to provide a target for a broad range of antiviral agents. Available immunosuppressive antivirals are directed to control an often exaggerated pro-inflammatory response that gives rise to complex clinical conditions such as lymphocytopenia. It is known that IL-6, via its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), initiates a pro-inflammatory response while an anti-inflammatory response is triggered by the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). Future antivirals should thus aim to target the mechanism that regulates switching between IL-6 trans- and classical-signaling. In this review, we propose that the tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 converting enzyme ADAM-17 could be the master molecule involved in regulating IL-6 class switching and through this in controlling pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli. Therefore, ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery that would regulate host reactivity to infection and thereby limit or prevent fatal outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADAM-17", "Antiviral", "Cytokine storm", "Dengue", "Ebola", "IL-6", "Pro-inflammatory response", "SARS-CoV", "Virus"], "IndexKeywords": ["ADAM17 Protein", "Animals", "Antiviral Agents", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Receptors, Interleukin-6", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059475738", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55626281800": {"Name": "Mahmud-Al-Rafat A.", "AuthorID": "55626281800", "AffiliationID": "60027315", "AffiliationName": "Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline, Khulna University"}, "57205303154": {"Name": "Didarul Islam K.M.", "AuthorID": "57205303154", "AffiliationID": "60027315", "AffiliationName": "Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline, Khulna University"}, "7007061155": {"Name": "Billah M.M.", "AuthorID": "7007061155", "AffiliationID": "60027315", "AffiliationName": "Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering Discipline, Khulna University"}, "57209095485": {"Name": "Majumder A.", "AuthorID": "57209095485", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School"}, "57195808414": {"Name": "Taufiqur Rahman K.M.", "AuthorID": "57195808414", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Ottawa"}, "55495977400": {"Name": "Mahedi Hasan A.M.", "AuthorID": "55495977400", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cell Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7006024634": {"Name": "Taylor-Robinson A.W.", "AuthorID": "7006024634", "AffiliationID": "60099247", "AffiliationName": "School of Health, Medical & Applied Sciences, Central Queensland University"}}}
