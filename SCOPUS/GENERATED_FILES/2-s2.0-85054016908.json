This disease has a 50% risk of recurrence and 20% risk of progression within 5 years, despite the use of intravesical adjuvant treatments (such as BCG or mitomycin C) that are recommended by clinical guidelines. Intravesical device-assisted therapies, such as radiofrequency-induced thermochemotherapeutic effect (RITE), conductive hyperthermic chemotherapy, and electromotive drug administration (EMDA), have shown promising efficacy. These device-assisted treatments are an attractive alternative to BCG, as issues with supply have been a problem in some countries. RITE might be an effective treatment option for some patients who have experienced BCG failure and are not candidates for radical cystectomy. Data from trials using EMDA suggest that it is effective in high-risk disease but requires further validation, and results of randomized trials are eagerly awaited for conductive hyperthermic chemotherapy. Considerable heterogeneity in patient cohorts, treatment sessions, use of maintenance regimens, and single-arm study design makes it difficult to draw solid conclusions, although randomized controlled trials have been reported for RITE and EMDA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravesical", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Carcinoma in Situ", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Hyperthermia, Induced", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Radiofrequency Therapy", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054016908", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57201942956": {"Name": "Tan W.S.", "AuthorID": "57201942956", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}}}
