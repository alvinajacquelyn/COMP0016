Glomerular mesangial expansion and fibrosis are hallmarks of diabetic nephropathy and this is thought to be promoted by infiltration of circulating macrophages. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) has been shown to attract macrophages in kidney diseases. P2X7 receptors (P2X7R) are highly expressed on macrophages and are essential components of pro-inflammatory signaling in multiple tissues. Here we show that in diabetic patients, renal P2X7R expression is associated with severe mesangial expansion, impaired glomerular filtration (\u2264 40 ml/min/1.73 sq. m.), and increased interstitial fibrosis. P2X7R activation enhanced the release of MCP-1 in human mesangial cells cultured under high glucose conditions. In mice, P2X7R-deficiency prevented glomerular macrophage attraction and collagen IV deposition; however, the more severe interstitial inflammation and fibrosis often seen in human diabetic kidney diseases was not modelled. Finally, we demonstrate that a P2X7R inhibitor (AZ11657312) can reduce renal macrophage accrual following the establishment of hyperglycemia in a model of diabetic nephropathy. Collectively these data suggest that P2X7R activation may contribute to the high prevalence of kidney disease found in diabetics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CKD", "Cytokine", "Glucose", "P2", "Purine", "Renal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Chemokine CCL2", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Kidney", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mesangial Cells", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Purinergic P2X Receptor Antagonists", "Pyridines", "Rats, Wistar", "Receptors, Purinergic P2X7", "Tetrazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018627821", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"54684542100": {"Name": "Menzies R.I.", "AuthorID": "54684542100", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, The University of Edinburgh"}, "55939230000": {"Name": "Mullins J.J.", "AuthorID": "55939230000", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, The University of Edinburgh"}, "35556471900": {"Name": "Bailey M.A.", "AuthorID": "35556471900", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, The University of Edinburgh"}, "57220670417": {"Name": "Booth J.W.R.", "AuthorID": "57220670417", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "7402491487": {"Name": "Norman J.T.", "AuthorID": "7402491487", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "8234615900": {"Name": "Unwin R.J.", "AuthorID": "8234615900", "AffiliationID": "60000666", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular and Metabolic Diseases (CVMD) iMed, AstraZeneca"}, "7004921626": {"Name": "Tam F.W.K.", "AuthorID": "7004921626", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Renal and Transplant Centre, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
