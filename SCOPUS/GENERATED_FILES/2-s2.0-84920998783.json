However, whether CTLA-4 acts simply to veto the activation of certain clones or plays a more nuanced role in shaping the quality of T-cell responses is not clear. Here we report that T cells in CTLA-4-deficient mice show spontaneous Tfollicular helper (TFH) differentiation in vivo, and this is accompanied by the appearance of large germinal centers (GCs). Remarkably, short-term blockade with anti-CTLA-4 antibody in wild-type mice is sufficient to elicit TFH generation and GC development. The latter occurs in a CD28-dependent manner, consistent with the known role of CTLA-4 in regulating the CD28 pathway. CTLA-4 can act by down-regulating CD80 and CD86 on antigen presenting cells (APCs), thereby altering the level of CD28 engagement. To mimic reduced CD28 ligation, we used mice heterozygous for CD28, revealing that the magnitude of CD28 engagement is tightly linked to the propensity for TFH differentiation. In contrast, other parameters of T-cell activation, including CD62L down-regulation and Ki67 expression, were relatively insensitive to altered CD28 level. Altered TFH generation as a result of graded reduction in CD28 was associated with decreased numbers of GC B cells and a reduction in overall GC size. These data support a model in which CTLA-4 control of immunity goes beyond vetoing T-cell priming and encompasses the regulation of TFH differentiation by graded control of CD28 engagement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmunity", "CD28", "Costimulation", "CTLA-4", "TCell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive Immunity", "Animals", "Antigens, CD28", "Antigens, CD80", "Antigens, CD86", "Autoantibodies", "Cell Differentiation", "CTLA-4 Antigen", "Germinal Center", "Heterozygote", "Ligands", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Knockout", "MicroRNAs", "Models, Immunological", "T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920998783", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56468584400": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "56468584400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "8873048100": {"Name": "Heuts F.", "AuthorID": "8873048100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "56481663700": {"Name": "Ovcinnikovs V.", "AuthorID": "56481663700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "54386197100": {"Name": "Wardzinski L.", "AuthorID": "54386197100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "56481164700": {"Name": "Bowers C.", "AuthorID": "56481164700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "56469610800": {"Name": "Kogimtzis A.", "AuthorID": "56469610800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "10046631800": {"Name": "Kenefeck R.", "AuthorID": "10046631800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "7005289543": {"Name": "Sansom D.", "AuthorID": "7005289543", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "7402359366": {"Name": "Walker L.", "AuthorID": "7402359366", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London Division of Infection and Immunityn"}, "24402995300": {"Name": "Schmidt E.", "AuthorID": "24402995300", "AffiliationID": "60007247, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford"}, "7402247675": {"Name": "Weiss A.", "AuthorID": "7402247675", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}}}
