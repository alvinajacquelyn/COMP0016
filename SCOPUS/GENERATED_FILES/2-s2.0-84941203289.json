Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in 90% of cases and the prevalence of faecal incontinence (FI) is 38%. This study comprises the largest case series assessing the efficacy of sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) treatment for incontinence in this patient group. Method: A retrospective analysis on prospectively collected data was performed on all SSc patients from our two centres who had undergone SNS for FI. Results: Ten female patients of mean age of 54 (37-72) years had temporary SNS performed. The mean duration of FI was 13 (2-25) years. All had passive FI. Each patient had preprocedure anorectal physiology and endoanal ultrasound examinations documenting internal sphincter atrophy/fragmentation or reduced anal resting pressure. Overall there was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.57) in the total Wexner incontinence scores before (mean 15.1 \u00b1 2.6 SD) and during temporary SNS procedures (mean 13.1 \u00b1 3.6 SD). Two patients with a significant improvement went on to have permanent SNS with only one achieving a favourable outcome at 1 year. Conclusion: This study showed that SNS failed to reduce episodes of leakage in nine out of 10 patients with systemic sclerosis affected with incontinence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Faecal", "Incontinence", "Sacral", "Scleroderma", "Stimulation", "Wexner"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Denmark", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Fecal Incontinence", "Female", "Great Britain", "Hospitals, University", "Humans", "Lumbosacral Plexus", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Failure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941203289", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"55682271600": {"Name": "Butt S.K.", "AuthorID": "55682271600", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Neurogastroenterology Unit, Royal Free and University College Hospital NHS Trust"}, "56828870000": {"Name": "Alam A.", "AuthorID": "56828870000", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Neurogastroenterology Unit, Royal Free and University College Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7401692748": {"Name": "Cohen R.", "AuthorID": "7401692748", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Neurogastroenterology Unit, Royal Free and University College Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Neurogastroenterology Unit, Royal Free and University College Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7003288720": {"Name": "Krogh K.", "AuthorID": "7003288720", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "6602668964": {"Name": "Buntzen S.", "AuthorID": "6602668964", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital"}}}
