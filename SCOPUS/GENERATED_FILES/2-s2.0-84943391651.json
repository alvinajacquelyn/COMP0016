Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-101 (miR-101) in regulating ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression and cholesterol efflux under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions in human THP-1-derived macrophages and HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells. Methods: The cell lines were transfected with one of four lentiviral vectors: miR-101, miR-101 control, anti-miR-101, or anti-miR-101 control. A luciferase reporter assay was used to examine miR-101 binding to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of ABCA1. Western blotting was conducted to assess ABCA1 protein expression. Cells were loaded with BODIPY-cholesterol and stained with oil red O to assess cholesterol efflux. Results: The luciferase activity assay revealed that wild-type miR-101 binding at site 2 significantly repressed ABCA1 3' UTR activity, suggesting that miR-101 directly targets the ABCA1 mRNA at site 2. In both cell lines, Western blotting revealed that miR-101 expression negatively regulates ABCA1 protein expression and significantly suppresses cholesterol efflux to ApoA1 under both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-LDL conditions, which was confirmed by pronounced lipid inclusions visible by oil red O staining. In HepG2 cells, both IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 treatments produced significant miR-101 overexpression; however, in THP-1-derived macrophages, only IL-6 treatment produced significant miR-101 overexpression. Anti-mir-101 transfection under both IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 treatment conditions led to ABCA1 upregulation, indicating that miR-101 expression represses ABCA1 expression under inflammatory conditions. Conclusions: miR-101 promotes intracellular cholesterol retention under inflammatory conditions through suppressing ABCA1 expression and suggests that the miR-101-ABCA1 axis may play an intermediary role in the development of NAFLD and vascular atherosclerosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ABCA1", "Atherosclerosis", "ATP-binding cassette transporter A1", "Cholesterol", "IL-6", "Inflammation", "MicroRNA", "MiR-101", "MiRNA", "NAFLD", "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "TNF-\u03b1"], "IndexKeywords": ["3' Untranslated Regions", "ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1", "Blotting, Western", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Cells, Cultured", "Cholesterol", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Liver Neoplasms", "Luciferases", "Macrophages", "MicroRNAs", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Messenger", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943391651", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56994189300": {"Name": "Zhang N.", "AuthorID": "56994189300", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "56596073800": {"Name": "Lei J.Y.", "AuthorID": "56596073800", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "26025193000": {"Name": "Lei H.", "AuthorID": "26025193000", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "57208369646": {"Name": "Huang W.", "AuthorID": "57208369646", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "35273166000": {"Name": "Ruan X.", "AuthorID": "35273166000", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "John Moorhead Research Laboratory, Centre for Nephrology, University College London Medical School"}, "7601439961": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "7601439961", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Metabolism on Lipid and Glucose, Chongqing Medical University"}, "55712181600": {"Name": "Liu Q.", "AuthorID": "55712181600", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research, The First Affiliated Hospital, Chongqing Medical University"}}}
