Stem cells are highly expandable and have the potential to differentiate into any specialist cell. Use of patient-derived induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs) has the additional advantage for organ regeneration therapies by removing the need for immuno-suppression. We compared hepatocyte differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and hiPSCs in a mouse decellularised liver scaffold (3D) with standard in vitro protocol (2D). Mouse livers were decellularised preserving micro-architecture, blood vessel network and extracellular matrix. hESCs and hiPSCs were primed towards the definitive endoderm. Cells were then seeded either in 3D or 2D cultures and the hepatocyte differentiation was continued. Both hESCs and hiPSCs differentiated more efficiently in 3D than in 2D, with higher and earlier expression of mature hepatocyte marker albumin, lipid and glycogen synthesis associated with a decrease in expression of fetal hepatocyte marker alpha-fetoprotein. Thus we conclude that stem cell hepatocyte differentiation in 3D culture promotes faster cell maturation. This finding suggests that optimised 3D protocols could allow generation of mature liver cells not achieved so far in standard 2D conditions and lead to improvement in cell models of liver disease and regenerative medicine applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Extracellular Matrix", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Mice", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038857567", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26429621100": {"Name": "Lorvellec M.", "AuthorID": "26429621100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "57193201006": {"Name": "Fiadeiro R.", "AuthorID": "57193201006", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "57200037429": {"Name": "Zulini J.", "AuthorID": "57200037429", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57141796800": {"Name": "Little D.", "AuthorID": "57141796800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "55208168700": {"Name": "Mosaku O.", "AuthorID": "55208168700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6602308059": {"Name": "Gissen P.", "AuthorID": "6602308059", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "55312079100": {"Name": "Scottoni F.", "AuthorID": "55312079100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "54392763900": {"Name": "Crowley C.", "AuthorID": "54392763900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "54941130700": {"Name": "Maghsoudlou P.", "AuthorID": "54941130700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "56615988200": {"Name": "Pellegata A.F.", "AuthorID": "56615988200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "6701391657": {"Name": "Gjinovci A.", "AuthorID": "6701391657", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "56231276600": {"Name": "Mazzacuva F.", "AuthorID": "56231276600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute Barts, The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57095567900": {"Name": "Lyne A.M.", "AuthorID": "57095567900", "AffiliationID": "60030640, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Institut Curie, PSL Research University"}, "57203588678": {"Name": "Kelly D.", "AuthorID": "57203588678", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "The Liver Unit, Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital"}}}
