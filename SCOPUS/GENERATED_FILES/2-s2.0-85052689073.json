Our study examined the under-theorized, but no less important, type of orchestration that characterizes other organizations, such as business incubators and venture associations, who seek to support the dispersed entrepreneurial efforts of network members. We refer to this type as \u201copen-system\u201d orchestration, as opposed to the commonly studied \u201cclosed-system\u201d type performed by hub firms. Our findings reveal how the processes of open-system orchestration differ markedly from those of closed-system orchestration, and detail how these processes influence the micro-foundations of network members' sensing capabilities. By doing so, we also offer empirical substantiation and theoretical elaboration to the idea that dynamic capabilities might not reside exclusively inside firms, but could be co-created relationally with other parties in the business ecosystem.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052689073", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57192646772": {"Name": "Giudici A.", "AuthorID": "57192646772", "AffiliationID": "60020134, 60025704", "AffiliationName": "Cass Business School, City, University of London"}, "8663751500": {"Name": "Reinmoeller P.", "AuthorID": "8663751500", "AffiliationID": "60116362, 60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield School of Management, Cranfield University"}, "56006342100": {"Name": "Ravasi D.", "AuthorID": "56006342100", "AffiliationID": "60176025, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management, University College London"}}}
