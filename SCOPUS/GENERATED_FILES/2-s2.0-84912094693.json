A stimulation pulse is composed of a sequence of current pulses injected at a frequency of 1 MHz for which the duty cycle is used to control the stimulation intensity. The system features 8 independent channels that connect to any of the 16 electrodes at the output. A sophisticated control system allows for individual control of each channel's stimulation and timing parameters. This flexibility makes the system suitable for complex electrode configurations and current steering applications. Simultaneous multichannel stimulation is implemented using a high frequency alternating technique, which reduces the amount of electrode switches by a factor 8. The system has the advantage of requiring a single inductor as its only external component. Furthermore it offers a high power efficiency, which is nearly independent on both the voltage over the load as well as on the number of simultaneously operated channels. Measurements confirm this: in multichannel mode the power efficiency can be increased for specific cases to 40% compared to 20% that is achieved by state-of-the-art classical constant current stimulators with adaptive power supply.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Current steering", "dynamic power supply", "HVCMOS", "implantable medical devices", "low power", "multichannel", "neural stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternating technique", "External components", "High frequency HF", "High power efficiencies", "Independent channels", "Individual control", "Pulsed excitation", "Stimulation intensity", "Algorithms", "Electric Stimulation", "Equipment Design", "Humans", "Implantable Neurostimulators", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912094693", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"37014115600": {"Name": "Van Dongen M.", "AuthorID": "37014115600", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Section Bio-electronics, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technology"}, "7003394632": {"Name": "Serdijn W.", "AuthorID": "7003394632", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Section Bio-electronics, Department of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft University of Technology"}}}
