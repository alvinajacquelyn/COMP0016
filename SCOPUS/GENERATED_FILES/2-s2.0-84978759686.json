These sequences are over-represented in eukaryotic telomeres, promoters, and 5\u2032 untranslated regions. They can form quadruplex structures, which may be transient in many situations in normal cells since they can be effectively resolved by helicase action. Mutated helicases in cancer cells are unable to unwind quadruplexes, which are impediments to transcription, translation, or replication, depending on their location within a particular gene. Small molecules that can stabilize quadruplex structures augment these effects and produce cell and proliferation growth inhibition. This article surveys the chemical biology of quadruplexes. It critically examines the major classes of quadruplex-binding small molecules that have been developed to date and the various approaches to discovering selective agents. The challenges of requiring (and achieving) small-molecule targeted selectivity for a particular quadruplex are discussed in relation to the potential of these small molecules as clinically useful therapeutic agents.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Proliferation", "Drug Discovery", "G-Quadruplexes", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Nucleic Acids", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Telomerase", "Telomere"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978759686", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
