Whilst a country requires that all members of society conform to standardized legal requirements, cases arise that involve certain complexities related to the cultural or religious context in which a certain action was committed. This paper addresses the impact of culture on notions of criminal responsibility and action. Through a case study of a recent event in the United Kingdom, we explore whether a cultural defense is relevant for contextualizing incidents in which an individual commits a criminal action during an alleged period of spirit possession From this analysis, we suggest that using a cultural defense can aid understanding of an individual's relationship to the society that he or she identifies with and facilitate the practice of justice in a multicultural society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agency", "cultural defense", "culture", "justice", "spirit possession"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Criminals", "Cultural Diversity", "Female", "Humans", "Insanity Defense", "Liability, Legal", "Religion and Psychology", "Spirit Possession", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985994517", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57211885938": {"Name": "Ahmad A.", "AuthorID": "57211885938", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6603678680": {"Name": "Dein S.", "AuthorID": "6603678680", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}}}
