In addition, the phenotype of SCA2 expansions has been now extended to Parkinson disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Their diagnosis is currently based on a PCR to identify small expanded alleles, followed by a second-level test whenever a false normal homozygous or a CAT interruption in SCA1 needs to be verified. Next-generation sequencing still does not allow efficient detection of these repeats. Here, we show the efficacy of a novel, rapid, and cost-effective method to identify and size pathogenic expansions in SCA1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and recognize large alleles or interruptions without a second-level test. Twenty-five healthy controls and 33 expansion carriers were analyzed: alleles migrated consistently in different PCRs and capillary runs, and homozygous individuals were always distinguishable from heterozygous carriers of both common and large (>100 repeats) pathogenic CAG expansions. Repeat number could be calculated counting the number of peaks, except for the largest SCA2 and SCA7 alleles. Interruptions in SCA1 were always visible. Overall, our method allows a simpler, cost-effective, and sensibly faster SCA diagnostic protocol compared with the standard technique and to the still unadapted next-generation sequencing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Case-Control Studies", "Electrophoresis, Capillary", "Genetic Testing", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Spinocerebellar Ataxias"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045411774", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"6603422532": {"Name": "Cagnoli C.", "AuthorID": "6603422532", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "57209641549": {"Name": "Brussino A.", "AuthorID": "57209641549", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "37004677800": {"Name": "Mancini C.", "AuthorID": "37004677800", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "6701677236": {"Name": "Ferrone M.", "AuthorID": "6701677236", "AffiliationID": "60111308", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genetics Unit, Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital"}, "54412176000": {"Name": "Giorgio E.", "AuthorID": "54412176000", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "55507604100": {"Name": "Pozzi E.", "AuthorID": "55507604100", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "14719091400": {"Name": "Cavalieri S.", "AuthorID": "14719091400", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "16315341900": {"Name": "Di Gregorio E.", "AuthorID": "16315341900", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "56281712900": {"Name": "Ferrero M.", "AuthorID": "56281712900", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "56206861200": {"Name": "Brusco A.", "AuthorID": "56206861200", "AffiliationID": "60111308", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genetics Unit, Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital"}, "8427552500": {"Name": "Salmin P.", "AuthorID": "8427552500", "AffiliationID": "60111308", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genetics Unit, Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital"}, "23135201000": {"Name": "Pappi P.", "AuthorID": "23135201000", "AffiliationID": "60111308", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genetics Unit, Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital"}, "56851937600": {"Name": "Orsi L.", "AuthorID": "56851937600", "AffiliationID": "60111308", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, the Neurologic Division I, Department of Neuroscience and Mental Health, Citt\u00e0 della Salute e della Scienza University Hospital"}, "55411798200": {"Name": "Filla A.", "AuthorID": "55411798200", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Odontostomatological and Reproductive Sciences, University Federico II"}, "7005917994": {"Name": "De Michele G.", "AuthorID": "7005917994", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Odontostomatological and Reproductive Sciences, University Federico II"}, "57211706628": {"Name": "Gellera C.", "AuthorID": "57211706628", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Genetics of Neurodegenerative and Metabolic Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Carlo Besta Neurological Institute"}, "7005081882": {"Name": "Mariotti C.", "AuthorID": "7005081882", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Genetics of Neurodegenerative and Metabolic Diseases, Fondazione IRCCS Carlo Besta Neurological Institute"}, "6505751168": {"Name": "Nethisinghe S.", "AuthorID": "6505751168", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ataxia Centre, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6603845190": {"Name": "Giunti P.", "AuthorID": "6603845190", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ataxia Centre, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56385311700": {"Name": "Stevanin G.", "AuthorID": "56385311700", "AffiliationID": "60021567, 60015622", "AffiliationName": "Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence de Neurog\u00e9n\u00e9tique, H\u00f4pital de la Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Assistance Publique - H\u00f4pitaux de Paris"}}}
