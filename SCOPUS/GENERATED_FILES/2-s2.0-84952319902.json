However, there is a need for a general approach to BC lithography that critically considers all the steps from substrate preparation to the final pattern transfer. We present a procedure that significantly simplifies the main stream BC lithography process, showing a broad substrate tolerance and allowing for efficient pattern transfer over wafer scale. PDMS-rich poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane) (PS-b-PDMS) copolymers are directly applied on substrates including polymers, silicon and graphene. A single oxygen plasma treatment enables formation of the oxidized PDMS hard mask, PS block removal and polymer or graphene substrate patterning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Block copolymer nanolithographies", "Graphene substrates", "Lithography process", "Pattern transfers", "Poly(styrene-b-dimethylsiloxane)", "Single oxygen", "Substrate preparation", "Wafer scale"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952319902", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56542093100": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "56542093100", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Micro- and Nanotechnology, Technical University of Denmark"}, "56984649600": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "56984649600", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanostructured Graphene (CNG), Technical University of Denmark"}, "23973258700": {"Name": "Schulte L.", "AuthorID": "23973258700", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanostructured Graphene (CNG), Technical University of Denmark"}, "6603256406": {"Name": "Ndoni S.", "AuthorID": "6603256406", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Center for Nanostructured Graphene (CNG), Technical University of Denmark"}}}
