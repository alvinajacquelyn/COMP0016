To overcome these drawbacks, newefforts are developing for data fusion methodologies and the design of hybrid, dual-probe catheters to enable accurate assessment of plaque characteristics, and reliable identification of high-risk lesions. Today several dual-probe catheters have been introduced including combined near infrared spectroscopy-intravascular ultrasound (NIRS-IVUS), that is already commercially available, IVUS-optical coherence tomography (OCT), the OCT-NIRS, the OCT-near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) molecular imaging, IVUS-NIRF, IVUS intravascular photoacoustic imaging and combined fluorescence lifetime-IVUS imaging. These multimodal approaches appear able to overcome limitations of standalone imaging and provide comprehensive visualization of plaque composition and plaque biology. The aim of this review article is to summarize the advances in hybrid intravascular imaging, discuss the technical challenges that should be addressed in order to have a use in the clinical arena, and present the evidence from their first applications aiming to highlight their potential value in the study of atherosclerosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronary atherosclerosis", "Hybrid imaging", "Intravascular imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiac Imaging Techniques", "Computed Tomography Angiography", "Coronary Angiography", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Multimodal Imaging", "Photoacoustic Techniques", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Ultrasonography, Interventional"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016193685", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "6603908821": {"Name": "Jaffer F.A.", "AuthorID": "6603908821", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Center and Cardiology Division, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "6603599539": {"Name": "Gijsen F.J.", "AuthorID": "6603599539", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Center, Erasmus MC"}, "55972539700": {"Name": "Van Soest G.", "AuthorID": "55972539700", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Center, Erasmus MC"}, "23669358200": {"Name": "Tenekecioglu E.", "AuthorID": "23669358200", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Center, Erasmus MC"}, "56888186000": {"Name": "Zeng Y.", "AuthorID": "56888186000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Center, Erasmus MC"}, "35397523500": {"Name": "Van Der Steen A.F.W.", "AuthorID": "35397523500", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Center, Erasmus MC"}, "34573036500": {"Name": "Serruys P.W.", "AuthorID": "34573036500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Cardiovascular Health, NHLI, Imperial College London"}, "42061888600": {"Name": "Madden S.P.", "AuthorID": "42061888600", "AffiliationID": "60099502", "AffiliationName": "InfraReDx, Inc."}, "7404871906": {"Name": "Muller J.", "AuthorID": "7404871906", "AffiliationID": "60099502", "AffiliationName": "InfraReDx, Inc."}, "6701665141": {"Name": "Courtney B.K.", "AuthorID": "6701665141", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60029150", "AffiliationName": "Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Toronto"}, "55167164900": {"Name": "Fard A.M.", "AuthorID": "55167164900", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "7006907866": {"Name": "Tearney G.J.", "AuthorID": "7006907866", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "7004274142": {"Name": "Emelianov S.", "AuthorID": "7004274142", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at Austin"}, "36042815900": {"Name": "Stone P.H.", "AuthorID": "36042815900", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7006835273": {"Name": "Marcu L.", "AuthorID": "7006835273", "AffiliationID": "106127911", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of California"}}}
