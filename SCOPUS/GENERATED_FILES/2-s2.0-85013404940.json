The present study considers the role of emotional valence in providing an embodied learning experience in which to anchor abstract meanings. First, analyses of adult ratings of age-of-acquisition, concreteness and valence demonstrate that abstract words acquired early tend to be emotionally valenced. Second, auditory Lexical Decision accuracies of children aged 6\u20137, 8\u20139, and 10\u201311 years (n = 20 per group) complement these analyses, demonstrating that emotional valence facilitates processing of abstract words, but not concrete. These findings provide the first evidence that young, school-aged children are sensitive to emotional valence and that this facilitates acquisition of abstract words.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Decision Making", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Semantics", "Vocabulary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013404940", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36118188200": {"Name": "Ponari M.", "AuthorID": "36118188200", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "7006372166": {"Name": "Norbury C.F.", "AuthorID": "7006372166", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "55919485500": {"Name": "Vigliocco G.", "AuthorID": "55919485500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
