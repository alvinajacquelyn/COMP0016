Published by Elsevier Inc.The hallmarks of Alzheimer disease are amyloid-\u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles accompanied by signs of neuroinflammation. Lysozyme is a major player in the innate immune system and has recently been shown to prevent the aggregation of amyloid-\u03b21-40 in vitro. In this study we found that patients with Alzheimer disease have increased lysozyme levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and lysozyme co-localized with amyloid-\u03b2 in plaques. In Drosophila neuronal co-expression of lysozyme and amyloid-\u03b21-42 reduced the formation of soluble and insoluble amyloid-\u03b2 species, prolonged survival and improved the activity of amyloid-\u03b21-42 transgenic flies. This suggests that lysozyme levels rise in Alzheimer disease as a compensatory response to amyloid-\u03b2 increases and aggregation. In support of this, in vitro aggregation assays revealed that lysozyme associates with amyloid-\u03b21-42 and alters its aggregation pathway to counteract the formation of toxic amyloid-\u03b2 species. Overall, these studies establish a protective role for lysozyme against amyloid-\u03b2 associated toxicities and identify increased lysozyme in patients with Alzheimer disease. Therefore, lysozyme has potential as a new biomarker as well as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "A\u03b2 Aggregation", "Biomarker", "Drosophila", "Lysozyme"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Brain", "Cell Death", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Female", "Humans", "Insect Proteins", "Locomotion", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muramidase", "Peptide Fragments", "Plaque, Amyloid", "tau Proteins", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941209901", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"54882387400": {"Name": "Helmfors L.", "AuthorID": "54882387400", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "6602305979": {"Name": "Brorsson A.", "AuthorID": "6602305979", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Biotechnology, Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biology, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "56829091500": {"Name": "Boman A.", "AuthorID": "56829091500", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "6508004902": {"Name": "Civitelli L.", "AuthorID": "6508004902", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "7102759715": {"Name": "Nath S.", "AuthorID": "7102759715", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "55487189400": {"Name": "Sandin L.", "AuthorID": "55487189400", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "6507264795": {"Name": "Janefjord C.", "AuthorID": "6507264795", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "6508232951": {"Name": "K\u00e5gedal K.", "AuthorID": "6508232951", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Pathology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "7006456723": {"Name": "McCann H.", "AuthorID": "7006456723", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60022773", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Research Australia and University of New South Wales"}, "35352763700": {"Name": "Halliday G.", "AuthorID": "35352763700", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60022773", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Research Australia and University of New South Wales"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
