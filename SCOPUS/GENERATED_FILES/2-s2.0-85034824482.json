All rights reserved.Background:There is limited information about participation in organised population-wide screening programmes by people with disabilities.Methods:Data from the National Health Service routine screening programmes in England were linked to information on disability reported by the Million Women Study cohort participants.Results:Of the 473 185 women offered routine breast or bowel cancer screening, 23% reported some disability. Women with disabilities were less likely than other women to participate in breast cancer screening (RR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.62-0.65) and in bowel cancer screening (RR=0.75, 0.73-0.76). Difficulties with self-care or vision were associated with the greatest reduction in screening participation.Conclusion:Participation in routine cancer screening programmes in England is reduced in people with disabilities and participation varies by type of disability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bowel cancer", "breast cancer", "disability", "participation", "screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Breast Neoplasms", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Disabled Persons", "Early Detection of Cancer", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Patient Participation", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034824482", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"39761304200": {"Name": "Floud S.", "AuthorID": "39761304200", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "7102125900": {"Name": "Barnes I.", "AuthorID": "7102125900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "23570624800": {"Name": "Gathani T.", "AuthorID": "23570624800", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7005172311": {"Name": "Blanks R.G.", "AuthorID": "7005172311", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "57193072440": {"Name": "Alison R.", "AuthorID": "57193072440", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "56231743100": {"Name": "Patnick J.", "AuthorID": "56231743100", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "57205523930": {"Name": "Beral V.", "AuthorID": "57205523930", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "55066654100": {"Name": "Green J.", "AuthorID": "55066654100", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "7102986656": {"Name": "Reeves G.K.", "AuthorID": "7102986656", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "57197793690": {"Name": "Verf\u00fcrden M.", "AuthorID": "57197793690", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004023998": {"Name": "Kuper H.", "AuthorID": "7004023998", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Evidence in Disability, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
