To review the available literature on medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) associated with antiangiogenics in antiresorptive-na\u00efve individuals. Methods. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science in December 2017. Results. We identified reports describing a total of 35 antiresorptive drugs-na\u00efve patients who developed antiangiogenic-related MRONJ. The mean age of these patients was 59.06 years and the F: M ratio was 4: 5. The most common underlying disease was metastatic renal cell cancer. Pain to the mandible was the most common complaint (34.29%) and the majority of patients presented with bone exposure. The mean duration of intravenous and oral antiangiogenics before MRONJ development was 6.5 and 16.72 months, respectively. The most common additional risk factor was dental extraction (37.14%). Almost half of the MRONJ patients (48.57%) received surgical treatment. 18 patients (62.06%) were reported to have disease resolution within an average time of 6.75 months. Conclusion. MRONJ associated with antiangiogenic therapy in antiresorptive-na\u00efve patients is a rare but potentially serious adverse effect. Available data suggests that there might be notable differences between MRONJ associated with antiangiogenics and antiresorptives; however, further prospective well-designed studies are required.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Tooth Extraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046854599", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57202032088": {"Name": "Pimolbutr K.", "AuthorID": "57202032088", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral Medicine and Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Mahidol University"}, "7201730425": {"Name": "Porter S.", "AuthorID": "7201730425", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7004087651": {"Name": "Fedele S.", "AuthorID": "7004087651", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London, Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
