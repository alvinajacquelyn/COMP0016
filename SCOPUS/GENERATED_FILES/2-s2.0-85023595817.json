The aim of this study was to map the geographical accessibility of yellow fever vaccination centres (YFVC) in EWNI. Methods The location of 3208 YFVC were geocoded and the average geodetic distance to nearest YFVC was calculated for each population unit. Data on trips abroad and centres were obtained regionally for EWNI and nationally for the World Top20 countries in terms of travel. Results The mean distance to nearest YFVC was 2.4 km and only 1% of the population had to travel more than 16.1 km to their nearest centre. The number of vaccines administered regionally in EWNI was found correlated with the number of trips to yellow fever countries. The number of centres per 100,000 trips was 6.1 in EWNI, which was below United States (12.1) and above the rest of Top20 countries. Conclusions The service availability was in line with demand regionally. With the exception of remote, rural areas, yellow fever vaccination services were widely available with only short distances to cover for the travelling public.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geographical accessibility", "Preventive medicine", "Vaccinations", "Yellow fever"], "IndexKeywords": ["Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Travel", "Travel Medicine", "United Kingdom", "Vaccination", "Yellow Fever", "Yellow Fever Vaccine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023595817", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56343685600": {"Name": "Petersen J.", "AuthorID": "56343685600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC), University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402238649": {"Name": "Patel D.", "AuthorID": "7402238649", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC), University College London Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55015696700": {"Name": "Simons H.", "AuthorID": "55015696700", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "National Travel Health Network and Centre (NaTHNaC), Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}}}
