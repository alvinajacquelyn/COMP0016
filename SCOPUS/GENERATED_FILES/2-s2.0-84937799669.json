From a Milky Way like N-body disc galaxy simulation, we have created mock Gaia data using M0III stars as tracers, taking into account extinction and the expected Gaia errors. In primal, observables calculated from the N-body model are compared with the target stars, at the position of the target stars. Using primal, the masses of the N-body model particles are changed to reproduce the target mock data, and the gravitational potential is automatically adjusted by the changing mass of the model particles. We have also adopted a new resampling scheme for the model particles to keep the mass resolution of the N-body model relatively constant. We have applied primalto this mock Gaia data and we show that primalcan recover the structure and kinematics of a Milky Way like barred spiral disc, along with the apparent bar structure and pattern speed of the bar despite the galactic extinction and the observational errors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bar structure", "Galactic disc", "Galaxy simulations", "Gravitational potential", "Made-to-measure", "Mass resolution", "Observational errors", "Resampling scheme"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937799669", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55668131500": {"Name": "Hunt J.A.S.", "AuthorID": "55668131500", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "57203073684": {"Name": "Kawata D.", "AuthorID": "57203073684", "AffiliationID": "60084281", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Holmbury St. Mary"}}}
