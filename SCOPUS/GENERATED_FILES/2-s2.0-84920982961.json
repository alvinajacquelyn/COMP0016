Updated information is now available from a 2012 survey: the Canadian Community Health Study-Mental Health (CCHS-MH). Method: The CCHS-MH employed an adaptation of the World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview and had a sample of n = 25 113. Demographic variables, treatment, comorbidities, suicidal ideation, and perceived stigma were assessed. The analysis estimated adjusted and unadjusted frequencies and prevalence ratios. All estimates incorporated analysis methods to account for complex survey design effects. Results: The past-year prevalence of MDD was 3.9% (95% CI 3.5% to 4.2%). Prevalence was higher in women and in younger age groups. Among respondents with past-year MDD, 63.1% had sought treatment and 33.1% were taking an antidepressant (AD); 4.8% had past-year alcohol abuse and 4.5% had alcohol dependence. Among respondents with pastyear MDD, the prevalence of cannabis abuse was 2.5% and that of dependence was 2.9%. For drugs other than cannabis, the prevalence of abuse was 2.3% and dependence was 2.9%. Generalized anxiety disorder was present in 24.9%. Suicide attempts were reported by 6.6% of respondents with past-year MDD. Among respondents accessing treatment, 37.5% perceived that others held negative opinions about them or treated them unfairly because of their disorder. Conclusions: MDD is a common, burdensome, and stigmatized condition in Canada. Seeking help from professionals was reported at a higher frequency than in prior Canadian studies, but there has been no increase in AD use among Canadians with MDD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crosssectional studies", "Depression", "Epidemiology", "Health care use", "Major depressive disorder", "Major depressive episodes", "Population studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Antidepressive Agents", "Canada", "Comorbidity", "Demography", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Suicidal Ideation", "Suicide, Attempted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920982961", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57201492915": {"Name": "Patten S.B.", "AuthorID": "57201492915", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Mathison Centre for Mental Health Research and Education, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}, "7409584357": {"Name": "Williams J.V.A.", "AuthorID": "7409584357", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Community Health Sciences and Psychiatry, University of Calgary, TRW Building, University of Calgary"}, "9042293400": {"Name": "Lavorato D.H.", "AuthorID": "9042293400", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Mathison Centre for Mental Health Research and Education, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}, "9250575900": {"Name": "Wang J.L.", "AuthorID": "9250575900", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Mathison Centre for Mental Health Research and Education, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}, "26654433500": {"Name": "McDonald K.", "AuthorID": "26654433500", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Mathison Centre for Mental Health Research and Education, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}, "7005805443": {"Name": "Bulloch A.G.M.", "AuthorID": "7005805443", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Mathison Centre for Mental Health Research and Education, Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}}}
