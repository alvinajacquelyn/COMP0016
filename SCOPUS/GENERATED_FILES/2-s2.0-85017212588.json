Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Who is \u2018the global citizen?\u2019. The ideals of global citizenship surrounding volunteer tourism have come under criticism for being invoked in universalising ways, whilst in fact expressing privilege. The assumption in these critiques of the global citizen as \u2018western, white, middle or upper class, educated, connected\u2019 overlooks the diversification of subjects taking part in volunteer tourism, even as it illuminates that we should question the idea of singular, abstract global citizen. This paper\u2013drawing on research with trips run by youth groups based on UK council estates travelling to sub-Saharan Africa\u2013uses perspectives on classed experiences of volunteering to offer some provocations. Firstly, it argues that it is inadequate to invoke a homogeneous figure of the \u2018privileged volunteer\u2019. Secondly, there is need for more work that asks how contemporary imaginings of \u2018good works\u2019 in the global south are constitutive of subjectivities and exert a political force in the global north, in various ways for particularly positioned subjects. The paper argues that for some subjects, popular ideals of \u2018global cosmopolitan citizenship\u2019 are being drawn into longer-standing projects of reform of the national citizen. However, studying volunteer tourism in practice always reveals ambivalent potential for more emancipatory dynamics and expressions of \u2018cosmopolitan empathy\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["class", "global citizenship", "Volunteer tourism", "youth"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017212588", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57190389262": {"Name": "Cheung Judge R.", "AuthorID": "57190389262", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
