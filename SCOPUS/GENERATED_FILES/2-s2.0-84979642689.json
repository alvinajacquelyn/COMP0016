The emergence of resistant Plasmodium falciparum parasites to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) represents a significant public health threat, indicating the urgent need for new effective compounds to reverse ACT resistance and cure the disease. For this, extensive curation and homogenization of experimental anti-Plasmodium screening data from both in-house and ChEMBL sources were conducted. As a result, a coherent strategy was established that allowed compiling coherent training sets that associate compound structures to the respective antimalarial activity measurements. Seventeen of these training sets led to the successful generation of classification models discriminating whether a compound has a significant probability to be active under the specific conditions of the antimalarial test associated with each set. These models were used in consensus prediction of the most likely active from a series of curcuminoids available in-house. Positive predictions together with a few predicted as inactive were then submitted to experimental in vitro antimalarial testing. A large majority from predicted compounds showed antimalarial activity, but not those predicted as inactive, thus experimentally validating the in silico screening approach. The herein proposed consensus machine learning approach showed its potential to reduce the cost and duration of antimalarial drug discovery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimalarial", "Curcuminoid", "In silico", "Michael addition", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR)", "Thioredoxin reductase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antimalarials", "Computer Simulation", "Curcuma", "Data Mining", "Drug Design", "Molecular Structure", "Parasitic Sensitivity Tests", "Plant Extracts", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979642689", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57188864829": {"Name": "Viira B.", "AuthorID": "57188864829", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Chemoinformatique, UMR7140 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "6701493703": {"Name": "Maran U.", "AuthorID": "6701493703", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Tartu"}, "55466900800": {"Name": "Gendron T.", "AuthorID": "55466900800", "AffiliationID": "60032928, 60103368", "AffiliationName": "Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Team, UMR 7509 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials (ECPM)"}, "23094985800": {"Name": "Lanfranchi D.A.", "AuthorID": "23094985800", "AffiliationID": "60032928, 60103368", "AffiliationName": "Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Team, UMR 7509 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials (ECPM)"}, "6701918848": {"Name": "Davioud-Charvet E.", "AuthorID": "6701918848", "AffiliationID": "60032928, 60103368", "AffiliationName": "Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Team, UMR 7509 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, European School of Chemistry, Polymers and Materials (ECPM)"}, "7103333601": {"Name": "Horvath D.", "AuthorID": "7103333601", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Chemoinformatique, UMR7140 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "15843431300": {"Name": "Marcou G.", "AuthorID": "15843431300", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Chemoinformatique, UMR7140 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "6604035715": {"Name": "Varnek A.", "AuthorID": "6604035715", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Chemoinformatique, UMR7140 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "13403465300": {"Name": "Cojean S.", "AuthorID": "13403465300", "AffiliationID": "60106095, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Antiparasitic Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, BioCIS, UMR 8076 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud"}, "7202395592": {"Name": "Loiseau P.M.", "AuthorID": "7202395592", "AffiliationID": "60106095, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Antiparasitic Chemotherapy, Faculty of Pharmacy, BioCIS, UMR 8076 CNRS-Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud"}, "7005829766": {"Name": "Maes L.", "AuthorID": "7005829766", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Microbiology, Parasitology and Hygiene (LMPH), Faculty of Pharmaceutical, Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences, University of Antwerp"}}}
