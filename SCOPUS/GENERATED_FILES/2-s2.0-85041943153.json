Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Periodontal involvement of the furcation area (furcation involvement, FI) has been reported to confer molars a higher risk of tooth loss. Aims: The aim of this retrospective analysis was to assess the effect of FI on disease progression and tooth loss in molars of patients with chronic periodontitis undergoing supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) in a UK private practice setting. Materials and Methods: Six-hundred and thirty-three molars were analysed in 100 chronic periodontitis patients treated with active periodontal therapy (APT) and followed up in SPT for at least 5 years. Molars were treated with a combination of resective, regenerative or conservative approaches, according to the different clinical needs. Results: Twenty-three molars were extracted during APT and a further 23 were lost during SPT. Multivariable analysis showed that both horizontal FI and vertical furcation component were associated with increased risk of tooth loss during SPT (OR 5.26, 95% CI: 1.46\u201319.03, p =.012 and OR 9.83, 95% CI: 1.83\u201350.11, p =.006, respectively). Conclusion: Attention should be placed on both horizontal and vertical FI in molars, owing to their association with tooth loss during SPT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["furcation", "maintenance", "periodontitis", "progression", "stability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic Periodontitis", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Furcation Defects", "Humans", "Male", "Molar", "Multivariate Analysis", "Radiography, Dental", "Retrospective Studies", "Tooth Extraction", "Tooth Loss", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041943153", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"22835642700": {"Name": "Nibali L.", "AuthorID": "22835642700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology & Regenerative Medicine and Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)"}, "55330279000": {"Name": "Akcal\u0131 A.", "AuthorID": "55330279000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology & Regenerative Medicine and Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology & Regenerative Medicine and Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)"}, "57191727502": {"Name": "Sun C.", "AuthorID": "57191727502", "AffiliationID": "112602172", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Suzhou Health College"}, "56545076500": {"Name": "Yeh Y.", "AuthorID": "56545076500", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"}, "7201525590": {"Name": "Tu Y.", "AuthorID": "7201525590", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"}}}
