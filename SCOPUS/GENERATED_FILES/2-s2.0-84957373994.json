All rights reserved.This chapter provides a discussion of current multi-scale energy systems expressed by a multitude of data and simulation models, and how these modelling approaches can be (re)designed or combined to improve the representation of such system. It aims to address the knowledge gap in energy system modelling in order to better understand its existing and future challenges. The frontiers between operational algorithms embedded in hardware and modelling control strategies are becoming fuzzier: therefore the paradigm of modelling intelligent urban energy systems for the future has to be constantly evolving. The chapter concludes on the need to build a holistic, multi-dimensional and multi-scale framework in order to address tomorrow's urban energy challenges. Advances in multi-scale methods applied to material science, chemistry, fluid dynamics, and biology have not been transferred to the full extend to power system engineering. New tools are therefore necessary to describe dynamics of coupled energy systems with optimal control.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Energy system modelling", "Future challenges", "Modelling controls", "Multi-scale frameworks", "Multiscale method", "Operational algorithms", "Power system engineerings", "Urban energy systems"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957373994", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "UCL Energy Institute"}, "7403037428": {"Name": "Koch A.", "AuthorID": "7403037428", "AffiliationID": "116319145", "AffiliationName": "EIFER European Institute for Energy Research"}, "54782106600": {"Name": "Bouffaron P.", "AuthorID": "54782106600", "AffiliationID": "116319145", "AffiliationName": "EIFER European Institute for Energy Research"}}}
