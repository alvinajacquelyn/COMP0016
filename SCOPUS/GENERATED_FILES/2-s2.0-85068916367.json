Here, we have defined early-onset PSP (EOPSP) and investigated its genetic and clinico-pathological profile in comparison with late-onset PSP (LOPSP) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: We included subjects from the Queen Square Brain Bank, PROSPECT-UK study, and Tracking Parkinson's study. Group comparisons of data were made using Welch's t-test and Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. EOPSP was defined as the youngest decile of motor age at onset (\u226455 years) in the Queen Square Brain Bank PSP case series. Results: We identified 33 EOPSP, 328 LOPSP, and 2000 PD subjects. The early clinical features of EOPSP usually involve limb parkinsonism and gait freezing, with 50% of cases initially misdiagnosed as having PD. We found that an initial clinical diagnosis of EOPSP had lower diagnostic sensitivity (33%) and positive predictive value (38%) in comparison with LOPSP (80% and 76%) using a postmortem diagnosis of PSP as the gold standard. 3/33 (9%) of the EOPSP group had an underlying monogenic cause. Using a PSP genetic risk score (GRS), we showed that the genetic risk burden in the EOPSP (mean z-score, 0.59) and LOPSP (mean z-score, 0.48) groups was significantly higher (P < 0.05) when compared with the PD group (mean z-score, \u22120.08). Conclusions: The initial clinical profile of EOPSP is often PD-like. At the group level, a PSP GRS was able to differentiate EOPSP from PD, and this may be helpful in future diagnostic algorithms. \u00a9 2019 The Authors.
