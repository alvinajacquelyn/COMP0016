Methods 26 normal pregnancies at 19\u201337 weeks of gestation underwent Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination at 1.5 T. DW Spin-Echo Echo Planar Imaging with diffusion gradients applied along 3 no-coplanar directions at seven different b-values (0,50,100,150,400,700,1000 s/mm2) was used. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pseudodiffusion (D*) and perfusion fraction (f) were extracted in selected placenta regions: umbilical (U-ROI), central (C-ROI) and peripheral (P-ROI). The relation between ADC, D*, f and mother age, gestational age (GA), Body-Mass Index (BMI), basal Glycaemia (bG), were evaluated. Pearson correlation with Bonferroni correction was used. Results A significant negative correlation was found between ADC and GA, for GA\u226530w in P-ROI, while no-dependence of ADC on GA was observed in GA range 19\u201329 weeks. A positive linear correlation was found between f and GA in the C-ROI and between f and GA in P-ROI for GA\u226530 week. No significant correlations were found between ADC, D*, f and age, BMI, bG. Conclusion ADC measurements in P-ROI of normal placenta reflects tissue changes occurring in the third trimester of gestation. Specifically, ADC decreases with GA increase. Besides, f increases with the GA increase in the C-ROI and during the third trimester of pregnancy in the P-ROI. These results suggest the potential of diffusion and perfusion parameters extracted by using a biexponential model to provide information about placenta changes during its development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADC", "DWI", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Normal placenta", "Perfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Diffusion", "Echo-Planar Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Middle Aged", "Perfusion", "Placenta", "Placentation", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, Second", "Pregnancy Trimester, Third", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026753917", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"6602715209": {"Name": "Capuani S.", "AuthorID": "6602715209", "AffiliationID": "60019925", "AffiliationName": "CNR ISC Roma Sapienza, Physics Department"}, "57192829791": {"Name": "Guerreri M.", "AuthorID": "57192829791", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "SAIMLAL Department, Morphogenesis & Tissue Engineering, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57193355856": {"Name": "Antonelli A.", "AuthorID": "57193355856", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological, Oncological and Pathological Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "26633467400": {"Name": "Bernardo S.", "AuthorID": "26633467400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological, Oncological and Pathological Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7103413151": {"Name": "Catalano C.", "AuthorID": "7103413151", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological, Oncological and Pathological Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6602355773": {"Name": "Manganaro L.", "AuthorID": "6602355773", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiological, Oncological and Pathological Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6701484102": {"Name": "Porpora M.", "AuthorID": "6701484102", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecological, Obstetrical and Urological Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7006849624": {"Name": "Giancotti A.", "AuthorID": "7006849624", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecological, Obstetrical and Urological Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}}}
