A Bayesian global fit is performed to construct a probability distribution for the effective Majorana mass, the observable of interest for these experiments. This probability distribution is then combined with the sensitivity of each experiment derived from a heuristic counting analysis. The discovery probability is found to be higher than previously considered, but strongly depends on whether the neutrino mass ordering is normal or inverted. For the inverted ordering, next-generation experiments are likely to observe a signal already during their first operational stages. Even for the normal ordering, in the absence of neutrino mass mechanisms that drive the lightest state or the effective Majorana mass to zero, the probability of discovering neutrinoless double-\u03b2 decay can reach \u223c50% or more in the most promising experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031118857", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"56810735300": {"Name": "Agostini M.", "AuthorID": "56810735300", "AffiliationID": "60136210", "AffiliationName": "Gran Sasso Science Institute"}, "55600276400": {"Name": "Benato G.", "AuthorID": "55600276400", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of California"}, "6701466528": {"Name": "Detwiler J.A.", "AuthorID": "6701466528", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Center for Experimental Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics, Department of Physics, University of Washington"}}}
