Collaborative control schemes that guide the operating clinician via repulsive and attractive force feedback based on intraoperative path planning can simplify this task. Computationally efficient algorithms, however, are required to perform rapid path planning and solve the inverse kinematics of the robot at interactive rates. This article presents a high-performance robot kinematics software architecture, which is used together with a multinode computational framework to rapidly calculate dense path plans for safe telemanipulation of unstable CTRs. The proposed software architecture enables on-the-fly, incremental, inverse-kinematics estimation at interactive rates, and it is tailored to modern computing architectures with efficient multicore central processing units (CPUs).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attractive force", "Collaborative control", "Computational framework", "Computationally efficient", "Computing architecture", "Interactive rates", "Robot kinematics", "Telemanipulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018863312", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56001386300": {"Name": "Leibrandt K.", "AuthorID": "56001386300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London"}, "55539304100": {"Name": "Yang G.", "AuthorID": "55539304100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre for Robotic Surgery, Imperial College London"}, "26422797000": {"Name": "Bergeles C.", "AuthorID": "26422797000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
