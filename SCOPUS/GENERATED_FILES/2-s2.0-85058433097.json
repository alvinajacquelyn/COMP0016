All rights reserved.Nanostructures built from biomolecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA are attracting attention in many areas of biological and materials sciences. Such nanoscale engineering was pioneered with proteins, yet the use of DNA is rapidly gaining traction. What are the advantages of the different biopolymers and which is best suited for a given molecular structure, function or application? In this Review, we evaluate the different structural properties of proteins and nucleic acids, as well as possible designs and synthetic routes for functional nanostructures. By comparing protein engineering and DNA nanotechnology, we highlight molecular architectures that are relevant in biotechnology, biomedicine and synthetic biology research, and identify emerging areas for research such as hybrid materials composed of protein and DNA/RNA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058433097", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57208345049": {"Name": "Pugh G.", "AuthorID": "57208345049", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "37087024100": {"Name": "Burns J.", "AuthorID": "37087024100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "8389134100": {"Name": "Howorka S.", "AuthorID": "8389134100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
