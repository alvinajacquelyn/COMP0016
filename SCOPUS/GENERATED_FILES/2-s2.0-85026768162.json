These models rely on large quantities of real data, such as corpora of documents, and have found applications in natural language tasks, such as word similarity, disambiguation, indexing, and search. Compositional distributional models extend the distributional ones from words to phrases and sentences. Logical operators are usually treated as noise by these models and no systematic treatment is provided so far. In this paper, we show how skew lattices and their encoding in upper triangular matrices provide a logical foundation for compositional distributional models. In this setting, one can model commutative as well as non-commutative logical operations of conjunction and disjunction. We provide theoretical foundations, a case study, and experimental results for an entailment task on real data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compositional semantics", "Distributional semantics", "Entailment", "Meaning", "Non-commutative logic", "Skew lattices", "Vector semantics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compositional semantics", "Distributional semantics", "Entailment", "Meaning", "Non-commutative logic", "Vector semantics"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026768162", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56502070700": {"Name": "Cvetko-Vah K.", "AuthorID": "56502070700", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana"}, "24339612000": {"Name": "Sadrzadeh M.", "AuthorID": "24339612000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56349668000": {"Name": "Kartsaklis D.", "AuthorID": "56349668000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602750653": {"Name": "Blundell B.", "AuthorID": "6602750653", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "ITS Research, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
