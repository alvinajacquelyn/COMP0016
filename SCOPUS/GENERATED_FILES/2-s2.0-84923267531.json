However, the exposure to adverse work environments is typically measured only using self-reported measures that are vulnerable to reporting bias, and thus any associations found may be explained by reverse causality. Using linear regression models and cross-lagged structural equation modeling (SEM), we tested the direction of the association between established job stress models (job demand control and organizational justice models) and 3 wellbeing indicators (psychological distress, sleeping problems, and job satisfaction) among 1524 physicians in a 4-year follow-up. Results from the longitudinal cross-lagged analyses showed that the direction of the association was from low justice to decreasing wellbeing rather than the reverse. Although the pattern was similar in job demands and job control, a reciprocal association was found between job control and psychological distress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Psychosocial factors", "Risk factors", "Sleeping problems", "Stress", "Working population"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Finland", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Job Satisfaction", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occupational Diseases", "Physicians", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Risk Factors", "Sleep Wake Disorders", "Stress, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Work", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923267531", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7003614400": {"Name": "Elovainio M.", "AuthorID": "7003614400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Sciences, University of Helsinki"}, "6507367189": {"Name": "Heponiemi T.", "AuthorID": "6507367189", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "57193642961": {"Name": "Aalto A.M.", "AuthorID": "57193642961", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Sciences,, University of Helsinki"}, "55347556900": {"Name": "Hakulinen C.", "AuthorID": "55347556900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Sciences,, University of Helsinki"}, "17344695200": {"Name": "Presseau J.", "AuthorID": "17344695200", "AffiliationID": "60010571, 60026712", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
