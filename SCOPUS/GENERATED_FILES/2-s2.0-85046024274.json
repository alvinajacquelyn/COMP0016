For endogenous visual attention, task performance improves as the duration of the cue-target interval increases up to 800 ms. Less is known about how endogenous auditory attention unfolds over time or the mechanisms by which an instructive cue presented in advance of an auditory array improves performance. The current experiment used five cue-target intervals (0, 250, 500, 1,000, and 2,000 ms) to compare four hypotheses for how preparatory attention develops over time in a multi-talker listening task. Young adults were cued to attend to a target talker who spoke in a mixture of three talkers. Visual cues indicated the target talker\u2019s spatial location or their gender. Participants directed attention to location and gender simultaneously (\u201cobjects\u201d) at all cue-target intervals. Participants were consistently faster and more accurate at reporting words spoken by the target talker when the cue-target interval was 2,000 ms than 0 ms. In addition, the latency of correct responses progressively shortened as the duration of the cue-target interval increased from 0 to 2,000 ms. These findings suggest that the mechanisms involved in preparatory auditory attention develop gradually over time, taking at least 2,000 ms to reach optimal configuration, yet providing cumulative improvements in speech intelligibility as the duration of the cue-target interval increases from 0 to 2,000 ms. These results demonstrate an improvement in performance for cue-target intervals longer than those that have been reported previously in the visual or auditory modalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention: Selective", "Audition", "Speech perception"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Cues", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Speech Perception", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046024274", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57189340121": {"Name": "Holmes E.", "AuthorID": "57189340121", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "The Brain and Mind Institute, Natural Sciences Centre, Western University"}, "7006459815": {"Name": "Summerfield A.Q.", "AuthorID": "7006459815", "AffiliationID": "60016418, 60107756", "AffiliationName": "Hull York-Medical School, University of York"}, "35315883700": {"Name": "Kitterick P.T.", "AuthorID": "35315883700", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Neuroscience, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}}}
