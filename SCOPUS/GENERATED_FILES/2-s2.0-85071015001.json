However, clothes often have complex texture and translucent material, such as holes and laces. It is thus difficult to extract clothes as foreground by existing generic natural image matting methods. Hence in this paper, we present a novel approach to automatic clothing matting from mannequins, with auxiliary information from a rough background image of the mannequin only. Experiments show that we can achieve remarkable improvement on the alpha matte near challenging regions of complex texture and translucent material of clothes. Moreover, our approach can automatically generate trimaps to facilitate the development and evaluation of other image matting algorithms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clothing image matting", "Virtual clothing try-on"], "IndexKeywords": ["Auxiliary information", "Background image", "Image matting", "Natural image matting", "New approaches", "Translucent materials", "Virtual clothing", "Virtual try-on"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071015001", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57210588054": {"Name": "Yuan B.", "AuthorID": "57210588054", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"}, "9336690700": {"Name": "Lu Z.", "AuthorID": "9336690700", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"}, "7102880275": {"Name": "Liao Q.", "AuthorID": "7102880275", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
