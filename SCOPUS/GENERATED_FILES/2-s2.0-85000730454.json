The effect of the aqueous media is taken into account by using the Solvation Model Based on Density model. Hydroxyl radical adds to the ring because the activation free energies (0.4\u201347.2 kJ mol\u22121) are low and also the Gibbs free energies have high negative values ((\u221227.4) to (\u22125.9) kJ mol\u22121). According to the calculations in most of cases the ortho- and para-addition is preferred in agreement with the experimental results. In these reactions hydroxycyclohexadienyl type radicals form. In a second type reaction, when loss of chlorine atom takes place, OH/Cl substitution occurs without cyclohexadienyl type intermediate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Advanced oxidation processes", "Dehalogenation", "DFT calculations", "Hydroxyl radical", "Phenylurea herbicide", "Radiolysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activation free energy", "Advanced Oxidation Processes", "Density modeling", "DFT calculation", "Hydroxyl radicals", "Hydroxylation reactions", "Phenylurea herbicides", "Theoretical study"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000730454", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"30567529300": {"Name": "Mile V.", "AuthorID": "30567529300", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60196683", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Energy Security and Environmental Safety, Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "6507421621": {"Name": "Hars\u00e1nyi I.", "AuthorID": "6507421621", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60196683", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Energy Security and Environmental Safety, Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "56343706900": {"Name": "Kov\u00e1cs K.", "AuthorID": "56343706900", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60196683", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Energy Security and Environmental Safety, Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7004368610": {"Name": "Tak\u00e1cs E.", "AuthorID": "7004368610", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60196683", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Energy Security and Environmental Safety, Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7004765936": {"Name": "Wojn\u00e1rovits L.", "AuthorID": "7004765936", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60196683", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Energy Security and Environmental Safety, Centre for Energy Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "6506138965": {"Name": "F\u00f6ldes T.", "AuthorID": "6506138965", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}}}
