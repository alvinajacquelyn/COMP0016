Here we consider a goal of no net loss (NNL) of biodiversity and explore the challenges of applying this aim to deep seabed mining, based on the associated mitigation hierarchy (avoid,minimize, remediate). We conclude that the industry cannot at present deliver an outcome of NNL. This results from the vulnerable nature of deep-sea environments to mining impacts, currently limited technological capacity to minimize harm, significant gaps in ecological knowledge, and uncertainties of recovery potential of deep-sea ecosystems. Avoidance and minimization of impacts are therefore the only presently viable means of reducing biodiversity losses from seabed mining. Because of these constraints, when and if deep-sea mining proceeds, it must be approached in a precautionary and step-wise manner to integrate new and developing knowledge. Each step should be subject to explicit environmental management goals, monitoring protocols, and binding standards to avoid serious environmental harm and minimize loss of biodiversity. \"Out of kind\" measures, an option for compensation currently proposed, cannot replicate biodiversity and ecosystem services lost through mining of the deep seabed and thus cannot be considered true offsets. The ecosystem functions provided by deep-sea biodiversity contribute to a wide range of provisioning services (e.g., the exploitation of fish, energy, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics), play an essential role in regulatory services (e.g., carbon sequestration) and are important culturally. The level of \"acceptable\" biodiversity loss in the deep sea requires public, transparent, and well-informed consideration, as well as wide agreement. If accepted, further agreement on how to assess residual losses remaining after the robust implementation of the mitigation hierarchy is also imperative. To ameliorate some of the inter-generational inequity caused by mining-associated biodiversity losses, and only after all NNL measures have been used to the fullest extent, potential compensatory actions would need to be focused on measures to improve the knowledge and protection of the deep sea and to demonstrate benefits that will endure for future generations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biodiversity offsetting", "Compensation", "Deep-sea mining", "Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)", "Mitigation hierarchy", "No net loss"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042769205", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"57194050996": {"Name": "Niner H.", "AuthorID": "57194050996", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University College London"}, "24330482600": {"Name": "Ardron J.", "AuthorID": "24330482600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton"}, "56134408700": {"Name": "Jones D.", "AuthorID": "56134408700", "AffiliationID": "60010934", "AffiliationName": "National Oceanography Centre"}, "7005846680": {"Name": "Escobar E.", "AuthorID": "7005846680", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnolog\u00eda-CU, Biodiversidad y Macroecologia, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}, "55364144600": {"Name": "Gianni M.", "AuthorID": "55364144600", "AffiliationID": "118736010", "AffiliationName": "Deep-Sea Conservation Coalition"}, "55947875100": {"Name": "Jaeckel A.", "AuthorID": "55947875100", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Macquarie Law School and Macquarie Marine Research Centre, Macquarie University"}, "7202247083": {"Name": "Levin L.", "AuthorID": "7202247083", "AffiliationID": "60121585, 60121575, 60030612, 60023018", "AffiliationName": "Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation and Integrative Oceanography Division, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego"}, "7501648696": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "7501648696", "AffiliationID": "60013791", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawaii at Manoa"}, "57190618563": {"Name": "Thiele T.", "AuthorID": "57190618563", "AffiliationID": "120305442", "AffiliationName": "Ocean Governance, Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies"}, "57190376021": {"Name": "Turner P.", "AuthorID": "57190376021", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Division of Marine Science and Conservation, Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University"}, "7005034079": {"Name": "Van Dover C.", "AuthorID": "7005034079", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Division of Marine Science and Conservation, Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke University"}, "7003446352": {"Name": "Watling L.", "AuthorID": "7003446352", "AffiliationID": "60013791", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Hawaii at Manoa"}, "6602575349": {"Name": "Gjerde K.", "AuthorID": "6602575349", "AffiliationID": "113801968", "AffiliationName": "IUCN Marine and Polar Programme"}}}
