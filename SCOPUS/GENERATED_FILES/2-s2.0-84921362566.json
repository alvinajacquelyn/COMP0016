Study design: A factorial (two pack styles x three warning types) within-subject experiment, with participants randomised to different orders of conditions, completed at a university in London, UK. Methods: Mock-ups of cigarette packets were presented to participants with their branded portion in either standardised (plain) or manufacturer-designed (branded) format. Health warnings were present on all packets, representing all three types currently in use in the UK: black & white text, colour text, or colour images with accompanying text. Gaze position was recorded using a specialised eye tracker, providing the main outcome measure, which was the mean proportion of a five-second viewing period spent gazing at the warning-label region of the packet. Results: An opportunity sample of 30 (six male, mean age=23) young adults met the following inclusion criteria: 1) not currently a smoker; 2) <100 lifetime cigarettes smoked; 3) gaze position successfully tracked for>50% viewing time. These participants spent a greater proportion of the available time gazing at the warning-label region when the branded section of the pack was standardised (following current Australian guidelines) rather than containing the manufacturer's preferred design (mean difference in proportions=0.078, 95% confidence interval 0.049 to 0.106, p<0.001). There was no evidence that this effect varied based on the type of warning label (black & white text vs. colour text vs. colour image & text; interaction p=0.295). Conclusions: During incidental viewing of cigarette packets, young adult never-smokers are likely to spend more time looking at health warnings if manufacturers are compelled to use standardised packaging, regardless of the warning design.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Cigarettes", "Eye tracking", "Health warnings", "Standardised packaging", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attention", "Australia", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Product Labeling", "Product Packaging", "Smoking", "Time Factors", "Tobacco Products", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921362566", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56237031200": {"Name": "Shankleman M.", "AuthorID": "56237031200", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7004642506": {"Name": "Sykes C.", "AuthorID": "7004642506", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, City University London"}, "6602277005": {"Name": "Yarrow K.", "AuthorID": "6602277005", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, City University London"}, "23566831100": {"Name": "Mandeville K.L.", "AuthorID": "23566831100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56458997900": {"Name": "Di Costa S.", "AuthorID": "56458997900", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Department of Psychology, University College London"}}}
