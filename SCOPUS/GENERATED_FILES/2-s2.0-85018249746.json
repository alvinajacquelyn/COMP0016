Although the activity of the enzyme is highly regulated, its molecular mechanism of activation remains largely unexplained, even after decades of research. By using state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations, we decipher the key elements of the complex molecular mechanism refined by evolution to allow for a fine tuning of p38\u03b1 kinase activity. Our study describes for the first time the molecular effects of different regulators of the enzymatic activity, and provides an integrative picture of the activation mechanism that explains the seemingly contradictory X-ray and NMR data.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Enzyme Activation", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018249746", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36463799200": {"Name": "Kuzmanic A.", "AuthorID": "36463799200", "AffiliationID": "60002016, 60108879", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB Barcelona), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology"}, "7006273085": {"Name": "Nebreda A.", "AuthorID": "7006273085", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies (ICREA)"}, "7102809158": {"Name": "Orozco M.", "AuthorID": "7102809158", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Barcelona"}, "23393975500": {"Name": "Sutto L.", "AuthorID": "23393975500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "23978674400": {"Name": "Saladino G.", "AuthorID": "23978674400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603509498": {"Name": "Gervasio F.", "AuthorID": "6603509498", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
