Subliminal sensory stimuli were reported to transiently inhibit somatosensory processing. Here we investigated whether such subliminal feedforward inhibition is reduced in patients with cervical dystonia. Methods: Sixteen cervical dystonia patients and 16 matched healthy controls performed a somatosensory detection task. We measured the drop in sensitivity to detect a threshold-level digital nerve shock when it was preceded by a subliminal conditioning shock, compared to when it was not. Results: Subliminal conditioning shocks reduced sensitivity to threshold stimuli to a similar extent in both patients and controls, suggesting that somatosensory subliminal feedforward inhibition is normal in cervical dystonia. Conclusion: Somatosensory feedforward inhibition was normal in this group of cervical dystonia patients. Our results qualify previous concepts of a general dystonic deficit in sensorimotor inhibitory processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cervical dystonia", "Cortical inhibition", "Subliminal feedforward inhibition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Analysis of Variance", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neural Inhibition", "Psychomotor Performance", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Torticollis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923224682", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"35408852800": {"Name": "Ferr\u00e8 E.", "AuthorID": "35408852800", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "37101265800": {"Name": "Ganos C.", "AuthorID": "37101265800", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE)"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
