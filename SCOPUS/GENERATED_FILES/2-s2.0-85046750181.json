All rights reserved.Objective: To compare the effect of immediate versus deferred antiretroviral treatment (ART) on neuropsychological test performance in treatment-naive HIV-positive adults with more than 500 CD4 + cells/\u03bcl. Design: Randomized trial. Methods: The START parent study randomized participants to commence immediate versus deferred ART until CD4 + less than 350 cells/\u03bcl. The START Neurology substudy used eight neuropsychological tests, at baseline, months 4, 8, 12 and annually, to compare groups for changes in test performance. Test results were internally standardized to z-scores. The primary outcome was the average of the eight test z-scores (QNPZ-8). Mean changes in QNPZ-8 from baseline were compared by intent-to-treat using longitudinal mixed models. Changes from baseline to specific time points were compared using ANCOVA models. Results: The 592 participants had a median age of 34 years; median baseline CD4 + count was 629 cells/\u03bcl; the mean follow-up was 3.4 years. ART was used for 94 and 32% of accrued person-years in the immediate and deferred groups, respectively. There was no difference between the immediate and deferred ART groups in QNPZ-8 change through follow-up [-0.018 (95% CI -0.062 to 0.027, P = 0.44)], or at any visit. However, QNPZ-8 scores increased in both arms during the first year, by 0.22 and 0.24, respectively (P < 0.001 for increase from baseline). Conclusion: We observed substantial improvement in neurocognitive test performance during the first year in both study arms, underlining the importance of using a control group in studies assessing neurocognitive performance over time. Immediate ART neither benefitted nor harmed neurocognitive performance in individuals with CD4 + cell counts above 500 cells/\u03bcl.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiretroviral treatment", "central nervous system", "HAND", "HIV", "neurocognitive impairment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "AIDS Dementia Complex", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Secondary Prevention", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046750181", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"23669409700": {"Name": "Wright E.J.", "AuthorID": "23669409700", "AffiliationID": "60019578, 60003344, 60189664, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases Alfred Health, Monash University, Burnet Institute, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity"}, "17345906900": {"Name": "Grund B.", "AuthorID": "17345906900", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "School of Statistics, University of Minnesota"}, "7102891308": {"Name": "Robertson K.R.", "AuthorID": "7102891308", "AffiliationID": "60017717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of North Carolina"}, "57191496890": {"Name": "Cysique L.", "AuthorID": "57191496890", "AffiliationID": "60025702, 60022773", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Research Australia, St. Vincent's Hospital Sydney, Applied Medical Research Centre"}, "7007185580": {"Name": "Brew B.J.", "AuthorID": "7007185580", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Program, Peter Duncan Neurosciences Unit, St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research, University of New South Wales"}, "35084875200": {"Name": "Collins G.L.", "AuthorID": "35084875200", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "57202013329": {"Name": "Poehlman-Roediger M.", "AuthorID": "57202013329", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "56526973000": {"Name": "Vjecha M.J.", "AuthorID": "56526973000", "AffiliationID": "100624017", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Research, Inc"}, "6506314379": {"Name": "Penalva De Oliveira A.C.", "AuthorID": "6506314379", "AffiliationID": "113055182", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Emilio Ribas"}, "36661530200": {"Name": "Standridge B.", "AuthorID": "36661530200", "AffiliationID": "60020147", "AffiliationName": "Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "57205902167": {"Name": "Carey C.", "AuthorID": "57205902167", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "57196347321": {"Name": "Avihingsanon A.", "AuthorID": "57196347321", "AffiliationID": "60028190, 60031780, 60016965", "AffiliationName": "HIV-NAT Thai Red Cross AIDS Research Centre and Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University"}, "6701464872": {"Name": "Florence E.", "AuthorID": "6701464872", "AffiliationID": "60028863", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Institute of Tropical Medicine"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "CHIP, Department of Infectious Diseases, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "6506318874": {"Name": "Arenas-Pinto A.", "AuthorID": "6506318874", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "7102575527": {"Name": "Mueller N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102575527", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Hospital Epidemiology, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57190525328": {"Name": "Nsubuga M.S.", "AuthorID": "57190525328", "AffiliationID": "120667170", "AffiliationName": "People in Need Agency (PINA)"}, "8323395100": {"Name": "Lal L.", "AuthorID": "8323395100", "AffiliationID": "60003344", "AffiliationName": "Burnet Institute"}, "57213628929": {"Name": "Price R.W.", "AuthorID": "57213628929", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of California San Francisco"}}}
