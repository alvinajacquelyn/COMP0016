Information from these analyses offers, in a direct way, insights into the biological distance, and consequently the gene flow and mobility patterns, among human populations in eastern Crete. The results are synthesised with the evidence of funerary practices in order to explore the nature of interaction among communities in eastern Crete. The biodistance analysis supports a strong genetic affinity between the populations represented at the two Kephala Petras skeletal assemblages, while the results of the available strontium isotope analysis favour their local origin; thus the combined results suggest the lack of significant population influx. The biological distance of the two chronologically contemporary populations at Livari-Skiadi, also manifesting completely different patterns of mortuary disposal, is of particular interest since it contrasts with the Petras situation and raises issues of intra-community distinctions, cultural and biological.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949536559", "SubjectAreas": [["Classics", "ARTS", "1205"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"24504508100": {"Name": "Triantaphyllou S.", "AuthorID": "24504508100", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of History and Archaeology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "45861427300": {"Name": "Nikita E.", "AuthorID": "45861427300", "AffiliationID": "100737531", "AffiliationName": "Fitch Laboratory, British School at Athens"}, "56816978900": {"Name": "Kador T.", "AuthorID": "56816978900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Bristol"}}}
