This conclusion, however, already follows from only three of Molna\u0155s metaphysical principles. One purpose of this note is to set the record straight. I provide an alternative reading of two of Molna\u0155s principles on which they are all needed to derive the desired conclusion. Furthermore, according to Molnar, the four principles may be inconsistent. By themselves, however, they are not. The other purpose of this note is to propose some plausible further principles that, when added to the four metaphysical theses, entail a contradiction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["correspondence", "falsity", "negation", "truth", "truth makers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042386580", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"55354654800": {"Name": "K\u00fcrbis N.", "AuthorID": "55354654800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Philosophy, Kin\u01f5s College London"}}}
