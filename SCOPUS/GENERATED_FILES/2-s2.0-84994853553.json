In order to formulate a model of decision-making among choices of technologies by these agents, we consider the following: context, the setting in which and the purpose for which a given technology is used; requirement, the level of privacy that the technology must provide for an agent to be willing to use the technology in a given context; belief, an agent\u2019s perception of the level of privacy provided by a given technology in a given context; and the relative value of privacy, how much an agent cares about privacy in this context and how willing an agent is to trade off privacy for other attributes. We introduce these concepts into the model, admitting heterogeneity among agents in order to capture variations in requirement, belief, and relative value in the population. We illustrate the model with two examples: the possible effects on the adoption of iOS devices being caused by the recent Apple\u2013FBI case; and the recent revelations about the non-deletion of images on the adoption of Snapchat.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Competing technologies", "iOS devices", "Privacy enhancing technologies", "Relative value", "Trade off"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994853553", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56235823000": {"Name": "Caulfield T.", "AuthorID": "56235823000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57207511534": {"Name": "Pym D.", "AuthorID": "57207511534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603594047": {"Name": "Ioannidis C.", "AuthorID": "6603594047", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Aston Business School, Aston University"}}}
