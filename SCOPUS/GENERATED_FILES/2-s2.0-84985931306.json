Evans and Guile's (Practice-based education: Perspectives and strategies, Rotterdam: Sense, 2012) theory of recontextualisation is used to explore the ways in which invisible or unplanned and unrecognised learning takes place as newly qualified nurses learn to delegate to and supervise the work of the healthcare assistant. In the British context, delegation and supervision are thought of as skills which are learnt \u201con the job.\u201d We suggest that learning \u201con-the-job\u201d is the invisible construction of knowledge in clinical practice and that delegation is a particularly telling area of nursing practice which illustrates invisible learning. Using an ethnographic case study approach in three hospital sites in England from 2011 to 2014, we undertook participant observation, interviews with newly qualified nurses, ward managers and healthcare assistants. We discuss the invisible ways newly qualified nurses learn in the practice environment and present the invisible steps to learning which encompass the embodied, affective and social, as much as the cognitive components to learning. We argue that there is a need for greater understanding of the \u201cinvisible learning\u201d which occurs as newly qualified nurses learn to delegate and supervise.", "AuthorKeywords": ["delegation", "invisible learning", "newly qualified nurses", "preceptorship"], "IndexKeywords": ["Allied Health Personnel", "Anthropology, Cultural", "Clinical Competence", "Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate", "England", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Learning", "Nurses", "Preceptorship", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985931306", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"7004335787": {"Name": "Allan H.", "AuthorID": "7004335787", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Middlesex University"}, "8532903700": {"Name": "Magnusson C.", "AuthorID": "8532903700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "55762634900": {"Name": "Westwood S.", "AuthorID": "55762634900", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "57193798668": {"Name": "Curtis K.", "AuthorID": "57193798668", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "15750531600": {"Name": "Horton K.", "AuthorID": "15750531600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "57201592972": {"Name": "Evans K.", "AuthorID": "57201592972", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education"}, "35607074300": {"Name": "Ball E.", "AuthorID": "35607074300", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "University of Salford"}, "23989037600": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "23989037600", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "University of Salford"}}}
