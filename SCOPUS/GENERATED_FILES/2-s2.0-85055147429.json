We describe the clinical features in two pedigrees with dominantly inherited retinopathy segregating the previously reported frameshifting mutation, c.836dupG (p.Ile280Asn*78) in the terminal exon of the RGR gene, and compare their haplotypes to that of the previously reported pedigree. METHODS. The probands were ascertained at West Virginia University Eye Institute (WVU) and Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) through next generation sequencing (NGS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) respectively. Clinical data included visual acuity (VA), visual fields, fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electroretinography (ERG). Haplotype analysis was performed using Sanger sequencing of the DNA from the molecularly ascertained individuals from the three pedigrees. RESULTS. Nine heterozygous mutation carriers were identified in two families. Four carriers were asymptomatic; five carriers had variable VA reduction, visual field constriction, and experienced difficulty under dim illumination. Fundus examination of the asymptomatic carriers showed diffuse or reticular pigmentation of the retina; the symptomatic carriers had chorioretinal atrophy. FAF imaging showed widespread signal loss in advanced retinopathy, and reticular hyperautofluorescence in mild cases. OCT showed loss of outer retinal lamina in advanced disease. ERG showed moderate-to-severe rod\u2013cone dysfunction in two symptomatic carriers; and was normal in three asymptomatic carriers. A shared haplotype flanking the mutation of up to 6.67 Mb was identified in both families. Within this region, 1.27 Mb were shared with the first family reported with this retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS. The clinical data suggest a variable and slow degeneration of the RPE. A shared chromosomal segment surrounding the RGR gene suggests a single ancestral mutational event underlying all three families.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autosomal dominant retinal dystrophy", "Deep retinal reticular pigmentation", "Next generation sequencing", "RGR", "Whole genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alleles", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Electroretinography", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Frameshift Mutation", "Genes, Dominant", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pedigree", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Retinal Degeneration", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Fields", "Whole Genome Sequencing", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055147429", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"20336610500": {"Name": "Ba-Abbad R.", "AuthorID": "20336610500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "11438905600": {"Name": "Chakarova C.", "AuthorID": "11438905600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6602825232": {"Name": "Waseem N.", "AuthorID": "6602825232", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6507036910": {"Name": "Mahroo O.A.", "AuthorID": "6507036910", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "7102202117": {"Name": "Holder G.E.", "AuthorID": "7102202117", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, National University of Singapore"}, "6508145987": {"Name": "Arno G.", "AuthorID": "6508145987", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7006493429": {"Name": "Leys M.", "AuthorID": "7006493429", "AffiliationID": "60032591, 60021143", "AffiliationName": "WVU Eye Institute, West Virginia University"}, "7501858933": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "7501858933", "AffiliationID": "60029833", "AffiliationName": "Genetics Laboratory, Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center"}, "36520865300": {"Name": "Carss K.J.", "AuthorID": "36520865300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases, University of Cambridge"}, "57216044821": {"Name": "Raymond F.L.", "AuthorID": "57216044821", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, University of Cambridge"}, "22833633600": {"Name": "Bujakowska K.M.", "AuthorID": "22833633600", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School"}, "7102960830": {"Name": "Pierce E.A.", "AuthorID": "7102960830", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School"}, "7201586123": {"Name": "Mohamed M.D.", "AuthorID": "7201586123", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "7102847533": {"Name": "Hummel M.", "AuthorID": "7102847533", "AffiliationID": "60022783, 60021143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Section of Medical Genetics, West Virginia University"}}}
