Published by Oxford University Press.Vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegfa) is essential for promoting the vascularization of the embryonic murine forebrain. In addition, it directly influences neural development, although its role in the forming forebrain is less well elucidated. It was recently suggested that Vegfa may influence the development of GABAergic interneurons, inhibitory cells with crucial signaling roles in cortical neuronal circuits. However, the mechanism by which it affects interneuron development remains unknown. Here we investigated the developmental processes by which Vegfa may influence cortical interneuron development by analyzing transgenic mice that ubiquitously express the Vegfa120 isoform to perturb its signaling gradient. We found that interneurons reach the dorsal cortex at mid phases of corticogenesis despite an aberrant vascular network. Instead, endothelial ablation of Vegfa alters cortical interneuron numbers, their intracortical distribution and spatial proximity to blood vessels. We show for the first time that vascular-secreted guidance factors promote early-migrating interneurons in the intact forebrain in vivo and identify a novel role for vascular-Vegfa in this process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortical development", "GABAergic interneurons", "Neurovascular coupling", "Vegfa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "Blood Vessels", "Cell Movement", "Chemotaxis", "Computer Simulation", "Embryo, Mammalian", "GABAergic Neurons", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Glutamate Decarboxylase", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Models, Neurological", "Neuropilin-1", "Prosencephalon", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptor, TIE-2", "Signal Transduction", "Stem Cells", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054880230", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7202252013": {"Name": "Barber M.", "AuthorID": "7202252013", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "35197934600": {"Name": "Andrews W.D.", "AuthorID": "35197934600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "46461656000": {"Name": "Memi F.", "AuthorID": "46461656000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57206731765": {"Name": "Gardener P.", "AuthorID": "57206731765", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6507906930": {"Name": "Ciantar D.", "AuthorID": "6507906930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56800330200": {"Name": "Tata M.", "AuthorID": "56800330200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7006265542": {"Name": "Parnavelas J.G.", "AuthorID": "7006265542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
