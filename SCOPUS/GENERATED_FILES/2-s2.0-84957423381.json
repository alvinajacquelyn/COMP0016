Adductor muscle tendon injuries represent a small but important number of these injuries. Avulsion of the tendons attached to the symphysis pubis has previously been described: these can be managed both operatively and non-operatively. We describe an uncommon variant of this injury, namely complete avulsion of the adductor sleeve complex: this includes adductor longus, pectineus and rectus abdominis. We go on to describe a surgical technique which promotes a full return to the pre-injury level of sporting activity. Over a period of ten years, 15 high-level athletes with an MRI-confirmed acute adductor complex avulsion injury (six to 34 days old) underwent surgical repair. The operative procedure consisted of anatomical re-attachment of the avulsed tissues in each case and mesh reinforcement of the posterior inguinal wall in seven patients. All underwent a standardised rehabilitation programme, which was then individualised to be sport-specific. One patient developed a superficial wound infection, which was successfully treated with antibiotics. Of the 15 patients, four complained of transient local numbness which resolved in all cases. All patients (including seven elite athletes) returned to their previous level of participation in sport.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Athletic Injuries", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Prospective Studies", "Rectus Abdominis", "Sports", "Tendon Injuries", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957423381", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57100860600": {"Name": "Tansey R.J.", "AuthorID": "57100860600", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "36191637500": {"Name": "Benjamin-Laing H.", "AuthorID": "36191637500", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "55064551200": {"Name": "Jassim S.", "AuthorID": "55064551200", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "57206439419": {"Name": "Shankar A.", "AuthorID": "57206439419", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "24073628200": {"Name": "Liekens K.", "AuthorID": "24073628200", "AffiliationID": "60102710", "AffiliationName": "AZ St Lucas Hospital"}}}
