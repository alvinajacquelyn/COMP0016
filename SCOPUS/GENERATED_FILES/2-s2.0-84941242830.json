For foils, the dependence on material thickness is found to be similar to the prediction of the Vehanen-M\u00e4kinen diffusion model; however, the magnitude is 5-10 times lower. A broad consensus is observed between experiment and the results of a three-dimensional model developed in this work. For a given thickness, meshes are found to be generally better than foils by around a factor of 10 with a maximum efficiency (\u223c10<sup>-3</sup>) comparable to that achieved with thin single crystal foils, in accord with previous measurements and the results of the present model.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion model", "Material thickness", "Maximum Efficiency", "Thin foil", "Three-dimensional model", "Transmission geometries", "Tungsten mesh"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941242830", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35424940800": {"Name": "Williams A.I.", "AuthorID": "35424940800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8850798200": {"Name": "Murtagh D.J.", "AuthorID": "8850798200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56423845900": {"Name": "Fayer S.E.", "AuthorID": "56423845900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603774027": {"Name": "Van Reeth P.", "AuthorID": "6603774027", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6604029802": {"Name": "Humberston J.W.", "AuthorID": "6604029802", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004221275": {"Name": "Laricchia G.", "AuthorID": "7004221275", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55012477600": {"Name": "Andersen S.L.", "AuthorID": "55012477600", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}, "55708116100": {"Name": "Chevallier J.", "AuthorID": "55708116100", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}, "7007086551": {"Name": "K\u00f6v\u00e9r", "AuthorID": "7007086551", "AffiliationID": "60002536", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nuclear Research, Hungarian Academy of Sciences (MTA Atomki)"}}}
