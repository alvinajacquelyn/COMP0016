Moving from 2D cell culture methods into 3D models enables more-accurate investigation of those interactions. Current 3D cancer models focus on cancer spheroid interaction with stromal cells, such as fibroblasts. However, over recent years, the cancer immune environment has been shown to have a major role in tumour progression. This review summarises the state-of-art on immunocompetent 3D cancer models that, in addition to cancer cells, also incorporate immune cells, including monocytes, cancer-associated macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Dendritic Cells", "Humans", "Immunocompetence", "Leukocytes", "Macrophages", "Models, Biological", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964907633", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"54393816500": {"Name": "Nyga A.", "AuthorID": "54393816500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Nanotechnology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL"}, "55212600600": {"Name": "Stamati K.", "AuthorID": "55212600600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Nanotechnology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL"}, "57204294898": {"Name": "Loizidou M.", "AuthorID": "57204294898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Nanotechnology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL"}, "57194391748": {"Name": "Neves J.", "AuthorID": "57194391748", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL"}, "9238779300": {"Name": "Cheema U.", "AuthorID": "9238779300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Materials and Tissues, Institute of Orthopaedics, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL"}}}
