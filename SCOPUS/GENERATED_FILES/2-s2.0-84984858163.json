After TH, body temperature is brought back to 37 \u00b0C over 14 h. Lactate/N-acetylasperatate (Lac/NAA) peak area ratio on proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) is the best available outcome biomarker following HIE. We hypothesized that broadband near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measured changes in the oxidation state of cytochrome-c-oxidase concentration (\u0394[oxCCO]) and cerebral hemodynamics during rewarming would relate to Lac/NAA. Broadband NIRS and systemic data were collected during rewarming from 14 infants following HIE over a mean period of 12.5 h.1H MRS was performed on day 5\u20139. Heart rate increased by 20/min during rewarming while blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) remained stable. The relationship between mitochondrial metabolism and oxygenation (measured as \u0394[oxCCO] and \u0394[HbD], respectively) was calculated by linear regression analysis. This was reviewed in three groups: Lac/NAA values <0.5, 0.5\u20131, >1. Mean regression coeffi cient (r2) values in these groups were 0.41 (\u00b10.27), 0.22 (\u00b10.21) and 0.01, respectively. The relationship between mitochondrial metabolism and oxygenation became impaired with rising Lac/NAA. Cardiovascular parameters remained stable during rewarming.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebral metabolism", "Cerebral oxygenation", "Cytochrome-c-oxidase", "Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury", "Newborn infant"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aspartic Acid", "Biomarkers", "Body Temperature Regulation", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Electron Transport Complex IV", "Female", "Hemoglobins", "Humans", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Infant, Newborn", "Lactic Acid", "Linear Models", "Male", "Mitochondria", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Oxygen Consumption", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Rewarming", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984858163", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"21135277300": {"Name": "Mitra S.", "AuthorID": "21135277300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "56321585100": {"Name": "Bale G.", "AuthorID": "56321585100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "7102666483": {"Name": "Meek J.", "AuthorID": "7102666483", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "55601032200": {"Name": "Uria-Avellanal C.", "AuthorID": "55601032200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}}}
