We aimed to examine the relationship between pre-surgical anxiety and caregiver burden and diurnal cortisol measured 2 months after the surgery in the caregivers of CABG patients. Method: We used a sample of 103 caregivers of elective CABG patients that were assessed 28.86 days before and 60.94 days after patients\u2019 surgery. Anxiety and caregiver burden were assessed using the anxiety subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Oberst Burden Scale respectively. Saliva samples were collected to measure cortisol area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) and diurnal cortisol slope. Anxiety and caregiver burden were entered into linear regression models simultaneously. Results: While high levels of pre-surgical anxiety were positively associated with increased follow-up levels of AUCg (\u03b2 = 0.30, p = 0.001), greater pre-surgery perceived burden score was associated with steeper cortisol slope (\u03b2 = 0.27, p = 0.017) after controlling for a wide range of covariates. Conclusion: These outcomes support the utility of psychological interventions aimed to increase the awareness of caregiving tasks and demands in informal caregivers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Caregivers", "Coronary Artery Bypass", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Perception", "Saliva"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062018071", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"57206845380": {"Name": "Singh Solorzano C.", "AuthorID": "57206845380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "54794172400": {"Name": "Leigh E.", "AuthorID": "54794172400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "36946348400": {"Name": "Poole L.", "AuthorID": "36946348400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "9042254800": {"Name": "Kidd T.", "AuthorID": "9042254800", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Sciences and Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "16039205300": {"Name": "Jahangiri M.", "AuthorID": "16039205300", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Surgery, St George\u2019s Hospital, University of London"}}}
