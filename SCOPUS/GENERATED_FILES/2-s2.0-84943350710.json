A few reported cases have documented its occurrence in prosthetic neo-joints or juxta-articular to this. We present the first reported case at a bone prosthesis interface remote from any joint and mimicking sarcoma recurrence because of its unusual location.", "AuthorKeywords": ["arthritis gouty", "gout", "hyperuricemia", "joint", "prosthesis and implant", "uric acid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Neoplasms", "Bone-Implant Interface", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Gout", "Humans", "Knee Prosthesis", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Middle Aged", "Osteosarcoma", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943350710", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"26656943300": {"Name": "Ogunwale B.B.K.", "AuthorID": "26656943300", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6504346616": {"Name": "Amary M.F.", "AuthorID": "6504346616", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.M.I.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7403917783": {"Name": "Green R.A.R.", "AuthorID": "7403917783", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
