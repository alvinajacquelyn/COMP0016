The analysis resolves long-standing discrepancies between models and data by demonstrating the importance of distinguishing between measured age-velocity dispersion relations (AVRs) and the heating histories of the stars that make up the AVR. We fit both AVRs and heating histories with formulae \u221dt\u03b2 and determine the exponents \u03b2R and \u03b2z derived from in-plane and vertical AVRs and \u03b2~R and \u03b2~z from heating histories. Values of \u03b2z are in almost all simulations larger than values of \u03b2~z, whereas values of \u03b2R are similar to or mildly larger than values of \u03b2~R. Moreover, values of \u03b2z (\u03b2~z) are generally larger than values of \u03b2R (\u03b2~R). The dominant cause of these relations is the decline over the life of the disc in importance of GMCs as heating agents relative to spiral structure and the bar. We examine how age errors and biases in solar neighbourhood surveys influence the measured AVR: they tend to decrease \u03b2 values by smearing out ages and thus measured dispersions. We compare AVRs and velocity ellipsoid shapes \u03c3z/\u03c3R from simulations to solar neighbourhood data. We conclude that for the expected disc mass and dark halo structure, combined GMC and spiral/bar heating can explain the AVR of the Galactic thin disc. Strong departures of the disc mass or the dark halo structure from expectation spoil fits to the data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: evolution", "Galaxies: spiral", "Galaxy: disc", "Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics", "Methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988882835", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55874901200": {"Name": "Aumer M.", "AuthorID": "55874901200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics"}, "7004066158": {"Name": "Binney J.", "AuthorID": "7004066158", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics"}, "26642272800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nrich R.", "AuthorID": "26642272800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics"}}}
