Little is known about local metabolic processes preceding the appearance and during the pathological development of new lesions. Objective: To identify metabolite changes preceding white matter (WM) lesions and pathological severity of lesions over time. Methods: A total of 59 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were scanned four times, with 6-month intervals. Imaging included short-TE magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Results: A total of 16 new lesions appeared within the MRSI slab in 12 patients. Glutamate increased (+1.0 mM (+19%), p = 0.039) 12 and 6 months before new lesions appeared. In these areas, the increase in creatine and choline 6 months before until lesion appearance was negatively correlated with radial diffusivity (\u03c1 = \u22120.73, p = 0.002 and \u03c1 = \u22120.72, p = 0.002). Increase in creatine also correlated with the increase of axial diffusivity in the same period (\u03c1 = \u22120.53, p = 0.034). When splitting the lesions into \u201cmild\u201d and \u201csevere\u201d based on radial diffusivity, only mild lesions showed an increase in creatine and choline during lesion formation (p = 0.039 and p = 0.008, respectively). Conclusion: Increased glutamate heralded the appearance of new T2-visible WM lesions. In pathologically \u201cmild\u201d lesions, an increase in creatine and choline was found during lesion formation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DTI", "metabolite", "MRI", "MRS", "MRSI", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043371283", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"35264309600": {"Name": "Klauser A.", "AuthorID": "35264309600", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Medical Informatics, University of Geneva"}, "54794673700": {"Name": "Wiebenga O.", "AuthorID": "54794673700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "57193553789": {"Name": "Eijlers A.", "AuthorID": "57193553789", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy & Neurosciences, VU University Medical Center"}, "25958454400": {"Name": "Schoonheim M.", "AuthorID": "25958454400", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy & Neurosciences, VU University Medical Center"}, "26643174700": {"Name": "Geurts J.", "AuthorID": "26643174700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy & Neurosciences, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "7006076844": {"Name": "Uitdehaag B.", "AuthorID": "7006076844", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Center"}, "7005232562": {"Name": "Pouwels P.", "AuthorID": "7005232562", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Medical Technology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}}}
