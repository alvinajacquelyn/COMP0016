There is limited information, however, on how sO-LIFE scores compare across different countries. The main goal of the present study is to test the measurement invariance of the sO-LIFE scores in a large sample of non-clinical adolescents and young adults from four European countries (UK, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain). The scores were obtained from validated versions of the sO-LIFE in their respective languages. The sample comprised 4190 participants (M = 20.87 years; SD = 3.71 years). The study of the internal structure, using confirmatory factor analysis, revealed that both three (i.e., positive schizotypy, cognitive disorganisation, and introvertive anhedonia) and four-factor (i.e., positive schizotypy, cognitive disorganisation, introvertive anhedonia, and impulsive nonconformity) models fitted the data moderately well. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis showed that the three-factor model had partial strong measurement invariance across countries. Eight items were non-invariant across samples. Significant statistical differences in the mean scores of the s-OLIFE were found by country. Reliability scores, estimated with Ordinal alpha ranged from 0.75 to 0.87. Using the Item Response Theory framework, the sO-LIFE provides more accuracy information at the medium and high end of the latent trait. The current results show further evidence in support of the psychometric proprieties of the sO-LIFE, provide new information about the cross-cultural equivalence of schizotypy and support the use of this measure to screen for psychotic-like features and liability to psychosis in general population samples from different European countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-cultural", "Equivalence", "Invariance", "Schizotypal", "Schizotypy", "SO-LIFE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Europe", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Personality Inventory", "Phenotype", "Psychometrics", "Psychotic Disorders", "Reproducibility of Results", "Schizotypal Personality Disorder", "Spain", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Switzerland", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943426528", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"17433855700": {"Name": "Fonseca-Pedrero E.", "AuthorID": "17433855700", "AffiliationID": "115135264", "AffiliationName": "Prevention Program for Psychosis (P3)"}, "55936660400": {"Name": "Ortu\u00f1o-Sierra J.", "AuthorID": "55936660400", "AffiliationID": "60012329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Educational Sciences, University of La Rioja"}, "53982158100": {"Name": "Sierro G.", "AuthorID": "53982158100", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Lausanne"}, "7102642087": {"Name": "Mohr C.", "AuthorID": "7102642087", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Lausanne"}, "7102352433": {"Name": "Daniel C.", "AuthorID": "7102352433", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004241930": {"Name": "Mason O.", "AuthorID": "7004241930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "24333907400": {"Name": "Cella M.", "AuthorID": "24333907400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7006796339": {"Name": "Preti A.", "AuthorID": "7006796339", "AffiliationID": "107130734", "AffiliationName": "Centro Medico Genneruxi"}}}
