The second paper examines the influence of intra-operative patient, transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound, and anaesthetic variables on the incidence of PEH. Methods In total, 106 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under general anaesthesia. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) changes, anaesthetic and vasoactive agents, analgesia, and post-operative pain scores, as well as TCD derived changes in middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocity during surgery were recorded. Patients who met pre-existing unit criteria for treating PEH after CEA (SBP > 170 mmHg without symptoms or SBP > 160 mmHg with headache/seizure/neurological deficit) were treated according to an established and validated protocol. Results In total, 40/106 patients (38%) required treatment for PEH following CEA (26 in theatre recovery [25%], 27 back on the vascular surgery ward [25%]), whereas seven (7%) had SBP surges > 200 mmHg on the ward. Patients requiring treatment for PEH had significantly higher pre-induction SBP (174 \u00b1 21 mmHg vs. 153 \u00b1 21 mmHg; p <.001), the greatest decreases in SBP after induction of anaesthesia (median decrease 100 \u00b1 32 mmHg vs. 83 \u00b1 24 mmHg; p =.01) and were significantly more likely to experience moderate/severe pain scores post-operatively (p =.003). Logistic regression analysis of the pre- and intra-operative data revealed that higher pre-induction mean SBP and lower pre-operative (impaired) BRS were the only independent predictors of PEH. Conclusion This analysis of intra-operative variables has demonstrated that patients with poorly controlled and/or labile hypertension at induction of general anaesthesia were those at greatest risk of requiring treatment for PEH in the post-operative period after CEA. No other variables, including use of vasopressors, treatment of hypotension, anaesthetic agents, or changes in MCA velocity after clamp release and restoration of flow were able to predict who might go on to require treatment for PEH. Identification of at-risk individuals and aggressive blood pressure control in the post-operative period remains the mainstay of treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anaesthesia or general anaesthesia", "Arterial pressure", "Autoregulation", "Baroreceptor sensitivity", "Carotid endarterectomy", "Cerebral", "Hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anesthesia, General", "Baroreflex", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Carotid Stenosis", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Cohort Studies", "Endarterectomy, Carotid", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Risk Factors", "Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029420406", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"36912216600": {"Name": "Newman J.E.", "AuthorID": "36912216600", "AffiliationID": "60007974", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Leicester Royal Infirmary"}, "7003652591": {"Name": "Bown M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003652591", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, University of Leicester"}, "16747911400": {"Name": "Sayers R.D.", "AuthorID": "16747911400", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, University of Leicester"}, "7102226893": {"Name": "Naylor A.R.", "AuthorID": "7102226893", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, University of Leicester"}, "12646454700": {"Name": "Thompson J.P.", "AuthorID": "12646454700", "AffiliationID": "60007974", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Leicester Royal Infirmary"}, "7402678951": {"Name": "Robinson T.G.", "AuthorID": "7402678951", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, University of Leicester"}, "7006171600": {"Name": "Panerai R.", "AuthorID": "7006171600", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences and NIHR Leicester Biomedical Research Centre, University of Leicester"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science and NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7102763287": {"Name": "Lacy P.", "AuthorID": "7102763287", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science and NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
