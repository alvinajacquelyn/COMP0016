All rights reserved.We reconstruct a Riemannian manifold and a Hermitian vector bundle with compatible connection from the hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator associated with the wave equation of the connection Laplacian. The boundary data is local and the reconstruction is up to the natural gauge transformations of the problem. As a corollary we derive an elliptic analogue of the main result which solves a Calder\u00f3n problem for connections on a cylinder.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057006464", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"]], "AuthorData": {"6602606312": {"Name": "Kurylev Y.", "AuthorID": "6602606312", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "36241865400": {"Name": "Oksanen L.", "AuthorID": "36241865400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6603735706": {"Name": "Paternain G.", "AuthorID": "6603735706", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, University of Cambridge"}}}
