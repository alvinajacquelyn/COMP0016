Thus, HRV monitoring has been used for early detection of sepsis in adults and neonates. Liver cirrhosis is associated with reduced basal HRV and the development of tolerance to the cardiac chronotropic effects of bacterial endotoxin. This may pose limitations on the use of heart rate monitoring in early detection of sepsis in this patient population. In a study to develop a physiomarker for the detection of sepsis in cirrhosis, we observed that endotoxin administration in adult cirrhotic rats leads to the development of transient heart rate decelerations, a phenomenon which has been reported in neonates with sepsis, and quantified using sample asymmetry analysis. In the present study, cirrhosis was induced by surgical ligation of the bile duct in rats. Cirrhotic rats were given intraperitoneal injections of either saline or endotoxin (1 mg kg-1). Changes in sample asymmetry and memory length of cardiac time-series were studied in conscious rats using implanted telemetric probes. Cirrhotic (but not control) rats exhibited increased sample asymmetry following endotoxin injection, which was consistent with the development of transient heart rate deceleration. Endotoxin administration in cirrhotic rats was associated with prolongation of memory length for observing decelerating perturbations in the cardiac rhythm. These findings may have application in the development of an HRV monitoring system for early detection of sepsis in cirrhosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cirrhosis", "endotoxin", "heart rate variability", "memory length", "sample asymmetry", "sepsis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Heart", "Heart Rate", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Sepsis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994495039", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57191892916": {"Name": "Taghipour M.", "AuthorID": "57191892916", "AffiliationID": "60005096", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Department of Physiology, Kharazmi University"}, "55607958500": {"Name": "Eftekhari G.", "AuthorID": "55607958500", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University"}, "55135771600": {"Name": "Haddadian Z.", "AuthorID": "55135771600", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University"}, "55001141700": {"Name": "Mazloom R.", "AuthorID": "55001141700", "AffiliationID": "60032053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University"}, "57191892601": {"Name": "Mani M.", "AuthorID": "57191892601", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, King's College London"}, "7101619634": {"Name": "Mani A.R.", "AuthorID": "7101619634", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
