All rights reserved.Within the community-randomized ANRS 12249 Treatment-as-Prevention trial conducted in rural South Africa, we analysed sexual behaviours stratified by sex over time, comparing immediate antiretroviral therapy irrespective of CD4 cell count vs. CD4-guided antiretroviral therapy (start at CD4cell count>350 cells/\u03bcl then >500 cells/\u03bcl) arms.Methods:As part of the 6-monthly home-based trial rounds, a sexual behaviour individual questionnaire was administered to all residents at least 16 years. We considered seven indicators: sexual intercourse in the past month; at least one regular sexual partner in the past 6 months; at least one casual sexual partner in the past 6 months and more than one sexual partner in the past 6 months; condom use at last sex (CLS) with regular partner, CLS with casual partner, and point prevalence estimate of concurrency. We conducted repeated cross-sectional analyses, stratified by sex. Generalized Estimating Equations models were used, including trial arm, trial time, calendar time and interaction between trial arm and trial time.Results:CLS with regular partner varied between 29-51% and 23-46% for men and women, respectively, with significantly lower odds among women in the control vs. intervention arm by trial end (P<0.001). CLS with casual partner among men showed a significant interaction between arm and trial round, with no consistent pattern. Women declared more than one partner in the past 6 months in less than 1% of individual questionnaires; among men, rates varied between 5-12%, and odds significantly and continuously declined between calendar rounds 1 and 7 [odds ratio=4.2 (3.24-5.45)].Conclusion:Universal Test and Treat was not associated with increased sexual risk behaviours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "antiretroviral therapy", "HIV", "prevention", "sexual behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Management", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Female", "Health Policy", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk-Taking", "Rural Population", "Sexual Behavior", "South Africa", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062419609", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57200285951": {"Name": "Rolland M.", "AuthorID": "57200285951", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905, 60116091", "AffiliationName": "University Bordeaux, ISPED, Inserm, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, UMR 1219"}, "57197830259": {"Name": "Tiendrebeogo T.", "AuthorID": "57197830259", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905, 60116091", "AffiliationName": "University Bordeaux, ISPED, Inserm, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, UMR 1219"}, "7101905261": {"Name": "Dabis F.", "AuthorID": "7101905261", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "15839872600": {"Name": "Orne-Gliemann J.", "AuthorID": "15839872600", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60000905, 60116091", "AffiliationName": "University Bordeaux, ISPED, Inserm, Bordeaux Population Health Research Center, UMR 1219"}, "16069002500": {"Name": "McGrath N.", "AuthorID": "16069002500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "26023442300": {"Name": "Larmarange J.", "AuthorID": "26023442300", "AffiliationID": "124008542, 60123796, 60028993, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Centre Population et D\u00e9veloppement, Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
