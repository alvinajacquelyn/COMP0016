Extemporaneous speech elicited from 40 French speakers of English with varied L2 proficiency levels was first evaluated by 10 native-speaking raters for comprehensibility and accentedness. Subsequently, the dataset was transcribed and analyzed for 12 lexical factors. Various lexical properties of L2 speech were found to be associated with L2 comprehensibility, and especially lexical accuracy (lemma appropriateness) and complexity (polysemy), indicating that these lexical variables are associated with successful L2 communication. In contrast, native speakers' accent judgements seemed to be linked to surface-level details of lexical content (abstractness) and form (variation, morphological accuracy) rather than to its conceptual and contextual details (e.g., lemma appropriateness, polysemy).", "AuthorKeywords": ["accentedness", "comprehensibility", "Second language speech", "vocabulary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931096594", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"36515364100": {"Name": "Saito K.", "AuthorID": "36515364100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck, University of London, Department of Applied Linguistics and Communication"}, "12752669100": {"Name": "Webb S.", "AuthorID": "12752669100", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "University of Western Ontario"}, "12778397100": {"Name": "Trofimovich P.", "AuthorID": "12778397100", "AffiliationID": "60033154", "AffiliationName": "Concordia University"}, "24466404600": {"Name": "Isaacs T.", "AuthorID": "24466404600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}}}
