Amongst classical Indian philosophers, the Buddhists argued for reidentification scepticism. In this essay, I will discuss two responses to this Buddhist argument. The first response, defended by V\u0101caspati Mi\u015bra (9th century CE), is that our outer senses allow us to knowledgeably reidentify objects. I will claim that this proposal is problematic. The second response, due to Jayanta Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da (9th century CE), is that the manas or the inner sense, functioning as a capacity of attention, helps us knowledgeably reidentify objects. I will explain how this second response answers the Buddhists\u2019 challenge.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attention", "Buddhism", "Ny\u0101ya", "object reidentification", "scepticism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054516796", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"57201973963": {"Name": "Das N.", "AuthorID": "57201973963", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}}}
