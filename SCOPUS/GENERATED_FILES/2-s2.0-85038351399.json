However, the lack of empirical evidence has lead to a debate on whether gravity is a quantum entity. Despite varied proposed probes for quantum gravity, it is fair to say that there are no feasible ideas yet to test its quantum coherent behavior directly in a laboratory experiment. Here, we introduce an idea for such a test based on the principle that two objects cannot be entangled without a quantum mediator. We show that despite the weakness of gravity, the phase evolution induced by the gravitational interaction of two micron size test masses in adjacent matter-wave interferometers can detectably entangle them even when they are placed far apart enough to keep Casimir-Polder forces at bay. We provide a prescription for witnessing this entanglement, which certifies gravity as a quantum coherent mediator, through simple spin correlation measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Casimir-Polder force", "Gravitational interaction", "Laboratory experiments", "Matter-wave interferometers", "Phase evolutions", "Quantum entities", "Spin correlations", "Spin entanglement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038351399", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203084776": {"Name": "Barker P.F.", "AuthorID": "57203084776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006557450": {"Name": "Mazumdar A.", "AuthorID": "7006557450", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Van Swinderen Institute, University of Groningen"}, "17435224400": {"Name": "Morley G.W.", "AuthorID": "17435224400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "14623577800": {"Name": "Ulbricht H.", "AuthorID": "14623577800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton"}, "57190953105": {"Name": "Toro\u0161 M.", "AuthorID": "57190953105", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Southampton"}, "8550716400": {"Name": "Paternostro M.", "AuthorID": "8550716400", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "CTAMOP, School of Mathematics and Physics, Queen's University Belfast"}, "7005032718": {"Name": "Geraci A.A.", "AuthorID": "7005032718", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Nevada"}, "36067105100": {"Name": "Kim M.S.", "AuthorID": "36067105100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "QOLS, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College"}, "7005193923": {"Name": "Milburn G.", "AuthorID": "7005193923", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60160423", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Queensland"}}}
