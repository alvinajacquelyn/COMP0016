Paint micro-samples were investigated by scanning electron and optical microscopy, and multi-spectral imaging of the paintings conducted at site. Azurite, vermilion, orpiment, indigo, and madder are the main inorganic and organic pigments identified. Pigments were typically applied in one or more layers on the wall surfaces, depending on the painting scheme and on the colour finish desired. The materials and techniques employed for the Saspol paintings are consistent with those known to exist in the region up to that time, with no indications of any new external influences as made out for their artistic style or iconographic content.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analysis", "Buddhist", "Imaging", "Ladakh", "Microscopy", "Pigments", "Saspol", "Wall paintings"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050275816", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57203017658": {"Name": "Pinto M.", "AuthorID": "57203017658", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar"}, "14719256100": {"Name": "Georgakopoulou M.", "AuthorID": "14719256100", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar"}, "55887173400": {"Name": "Gill M.", "AuthorID": "55887173400", "AffiliationID": "109722861", "AffiliationName": "Art Conservation Solutions"}, "56365394300": {"Name": "Menon S.", "AuthorID": "56365394300", "AffiliationID": "109722861", "AffiliationName": "Art Conservation Solutions"}}}
