Any instrumental imperfections that couple temperature fluctuations to B-mode polarization must therefore be carefully controlled and/or removed. We investigate the role that a scan strategy can have in mitigating certain common systematics by averaging systematic errors down with many crossing angles.We present approximate analytic forms for the error on the recovered B-mode power spectrum that would result from differential gain, differential pointing and differential ellipticity for the case where two detector pairs are used in a polarization experiment. We use these analytic predictions to search the parameter space of common satellite scan strategies in order to identify those features of a scan strategy that have most impact in mitigating systematic effects. As an example, we go on to identify a scan strategy suitable for the CMB satellite proposed for the European Space Agency M5 call, considering the practical considerations of fuel requirement, data rate and the relative orientation of the telescope to the earth. Having chosen a scan strategy we then go on to investigate the suitability of the scan strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmic background radiation", "Cosmology: observations", "Inflation", "Methods: observational"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018320801", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56285116500": {"Name": "Wallis C.G.R.", "AuthorID": "56285116500", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7405386498": {"Name": "Brown M.L.", "AuthorID": "7405386498", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, School of Physics and Astronomy, The University of Manchester"}, "7004373965": {"Name": "Battye R.A.", "AuthorID": "7004373965", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, School of Physics and Astronomy, The University of Manchester"}, "6603577641": {"Name": "Delabrouille J.", "AuthorID": "6603577641", "AffiliationID": "60105477", "AffiliationName": "APC"}}}
