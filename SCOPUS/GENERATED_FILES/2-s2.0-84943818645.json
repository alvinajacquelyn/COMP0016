Journal of Viral Hepatitis Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The efficacy of treatment for hepatitis C genotype 1 infection has significantly improved with the introduction of first-generation protease inhibitors. However, there remains a need for effective treatments for patients infected with other genotypes, for nonresponders and patients unsuitable for interferon. Sofosbuvir is the first nucleotide polymerase inhibitor with pan-genotypic activity. Sofosbuvir-based regimens have resulted in >90% sustained virological response across treatment-na\u00efve genotype 1-6 patients in five phase III clinical trials of sofosbuvir administered with ribavirin or pegylated interferon and ribavirin. This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir within the current licensed indication, for genotype 1-6 in the UK. A Markov model followed a cohort of 10 000 patients over lifetime, with approximately 20% initiating treatment for compensated cirrhosis. Sofosbuvir-regimens were compared to telaprevir, boceprevir, pegylated interferon and ribavirin, or no treatment. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. The cost perspective utilized costs applicable to the National Health Service in the UK. Sofosbuvir proved to be cost-effective in most patient populations with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at \u00a311 836/QALY and \u00a37292/QALY against telaprevir and boceprevir, respectively. In genotype 3, sofosbuvir had a weighted ICER of \u00a318 761/QALY. Sofosbuvir-based regimens are a cost-effective option for the majority of hepatitis C-infected patients in the United Kingdom although the incremental cost-effectiveness varies by genotype and regimen. Sofosbuvir and ribavirin is an alternative regimen for patients unsuitable for interferon.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic hepatitis C infection", "cost-effectiveness analysis", "sofosbuvir"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiviral Agents", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Great Britain", "Health Care Costs", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Sofosbuvir"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943818645", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"23567672700": {"Name": "Cure S.", "AuthorID": "23567672700", "AffiliationID": "115757475", "AffiliationName": "Mapi, Beaufort House"}, "56583875100": {"Name": "Guerra I.", "AuthorID": "56583875100", "AffiliationID": "115757475", "AffiliationName": "Mapi, Beaufort House"}, "7006885162": {"Name": "Dusheiko G.", "AuthorID": "7006885162", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Liver and Digestive Health Royal Free Hospital"}}}
