We define financialisation broadly as a trend towards a greater reliance on assets and/or debt, with particular manifestations across different domains of the economy: a greater reliance on financial tools and metrics for the state and non-financial corporations, a shift to market-based banking and increasing dependence on credit or asset-based welfare for households. We use OECD time-series balance sheet data and qualitative accounts drawn from the literature to overview economic change in our case countries. Using this informal comparison we develop the concept of \u2018variegated financialisation\u2019 by exploring the common but not convergent financialising trajectories of our case countries and relating them to the politics of finance\u2019s institutional embedding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["balance sheets", "European Union", "Germany", "the Netherlands", "United Kingdom", "variegated financialisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056852263", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57190296590": {"Name": "Ward C.", "AuthorID": "57190296590", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geography and Tourism KU Leuven"}, "56684402400": {"Name": "Van Loon J.", "AuthorID": "56684402400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geography and Tourism KU Leuven"}, "57193418726": {"Name": "Wijburg G.", "AuthorID": "57193418726", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning, Utrecht University"}}}
