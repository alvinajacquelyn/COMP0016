X-ray tomography samples of ca. 50 mm in diameter were prepared from a bulk sample and an internal tomogram was collected from the Ni-YSZ sample: this was achieved using a lab-based X-ray nano-CT instrument with an isotropic voxel resolution of 32 nm. To obtain a tomogram many 2D radiograph projections are collected at discrete angular increments through rotation of the sample, these projections are then reconstructed using a filtered back-projection algorithm into a 3D volume of greyscale voxels. Once reconstructed the data was segmented according to greyscale into three phases, Ni, YSZ and pore. A centroid path was then mapped for the Ni phase using Avizo Fire software (FEI, France) by applying a medial axis-based method using distanceordered homotopic thinning (DOHT) where a skeletonisation is achieved through a combination of morphological thinning and distance mapping techniques. Inspecting the figure, the central node connecting many segments displays a large heterogeneous Ni particle while in contrast the empty region in the bottom left of the figure displays no paths as no Ni occupied this region.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Central nodes", "Electrochemical activities", "Filtered back projection", "FIRE softwares", "Mapping techniques", "Ni-YSZ anode", "Thinning methods", "X-ray tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017461603", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57044825000": {"Name": "Heenan T.", "AuthorID": "57044825000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
