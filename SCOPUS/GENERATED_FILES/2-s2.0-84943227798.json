Methods: From the prospective, longitudinal BioFINDER study, we included 122 healthy elderly and 34 patients with mild cognitive impairment who developed AD dementia within 3 years (MCI-AD). \u03b2-Amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition in 9 brain regions was examined with [ 18 F]-flutemetamol PET. CSF was analyzed with INNOTEST and EUROIMMUN ELISAs. The results were replicated in 146 controls and 64 patients with MCI-AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. Results: The best CSF measures for identifying MCI-AD were A\u03b242/total tau (t-tau) and A\u03b242/hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) (area under the curve [AUC] 0.93-0.94). The best PET measures performed similarly (AUC 0.92-0.93; anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate/precuneus, and global neocortical uptake). CSF A\u03b242/t-tau and A\u03b242/p-tau performed better than CSF A\u03b242 and A\u03b242/40 (AUC difference 0.03-0.12, p < 0.05). Using nonoptimized cutoffs, CSF A\u03b242/t-tau had the highest accuracy of all CSF/PET biomarkers (sensitivity 97%, specificity 83%). The combination of CSF and PET was not better than using either biomarker separately. Conclusions: Amyloid PET and CSF biomarkers can identify early AD with high accuracy. There were no differences between the best CSF and PET measures and no improvement when combining them. Regional PET measures were not better than assessing the global A\u03b2 deposition. The results were replicated in an independent cohort using another CSF assay and PET tracer. The choice between CSF and amyloid PET biomarkers for identifying early AD can be based on availability, costs, and doctor/patient preferences since both have equally high diagnostic accuracy. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that amyloid PET and CSF biomarkers identify early-stage AD equally accurately.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Radionuclide Imaging", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943227798", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"25422587800": {"Name": "Palmqvist S.", "AuthorID": "25422587800", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Skane University Hospital"}, "7003614157": {"Name": "Minthon L.", "AuthorID": "7003614157", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Skane University Hospital"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Skane University Hospital"}, "57213307980": {"Name": "Olsson M.", "AuthorID": "57213307980", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Biology and Biological Physics, Lund University"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60105915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "36573616800": {"Name": "Johansson P.", "AuthorID": "36573616800", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}}}
