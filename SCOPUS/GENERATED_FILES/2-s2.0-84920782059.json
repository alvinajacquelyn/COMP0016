High concentrations are found in some rice-based foods and drinks widely used in infants and young children. In order to reduce exposure, we recommend avoidance of rice drinks for infants and young children. For all of the rice products, strict regulation should be enforced regarding arsenic content. Moreover, infants and young children should consume a balanced diet including a variety of grains as carbohydrate sources. Although rice protein-based infant formulas are an option for infants with cows' milk protein allergy, the inorganic arsenic content should be declared and the potential risks should be considered when using these products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "infants", "rice drinks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arsenic", "Carcinogens, Environmental", "Child", "Food Contamination", "Food Labeling", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Infant", "Oryza sativa", "Seeds", "Soil Pollutants", "Water Pollutants, Chemical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920782059", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"7801459343": {"Name": "Hojsak I.", "AuthorID": "7801459343", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital"}, "7004464897": {"Name": "Braegger C.", "AuthorID": "7004464897", "AffiliationID": "60002695", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital"}, "6603234228": {"Name": "Bronsky J.", "AuthorID": "6603234228", "AffiliationID": "60023469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Motol"}, "55881021700": {"Name": "Campoy C.", "AuthorID": "55881021700", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Granada"}, "7006817006": {"Name": "Colomb V.", "AuthorID": "7006817006", "AffiliationID": "60026877", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Necker"}, "7005367640": {"Name": "Decsi T.", "AuthorID": "7005367640", "AffiliationID": "60004737", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Pecs"}, "6508129151": {"Name": "Domell\u00f6f M.", "AuthorID": "6508129151", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Umea University"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "13611736500": {"Name": "Mis N.F.", "AuthorID": "13611736500", "AffiliationID": "60073906, 60021479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana"}, "6701736868": {"Name": "Mihatsch W.", "AuthorID": "6701736868", "AffiliationID": "100333388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Harlaching, Munich Municipal Hospitals"}, "7005027256": {"Name": "Molgaard C.", "AuthorID": "7005027256", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, University of Copenhagen"}, "7004219656": {"Name": "Van Goudoever J.", "AuthorID": "7004219656", "AffiliationID": "60070178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Emma Children's Hospital-AMC"}}}
