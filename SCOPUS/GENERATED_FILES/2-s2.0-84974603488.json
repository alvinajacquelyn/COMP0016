Although we know that the majority of synaptic GABAA R subtypes are assembled from \u03b11-3, \u03b2 and \u03b32 subunits, our understanding of how neurons facilitate their targeting to and stabilization at inhibitory synapses is rudimentary. To address these issues, we have created knock-in mice in which the pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the Myc epitope were introduced to the extracellular domain of the mature receptor\u03b12 subunit (pH\u03b12). Using immunoaffinity purification and mass spectroscopy, we identified a stable complex of 174 proteins that were associated with pH\u03b12, including other GABAA R subunits, and previously identified receptor-associated proteins such as gephyrin and collybistin. 149 of these proteins were novel GABAA R binding partners and included G-protein-coupled receptors and ion channel subunits, proteins that regulate trafficking and degradation, regulators of protein phosphorylation, GTPases, and a number of proteins that regulate their activity. Notably, members of the postsynaptic density family of proteins that are critical components of excitatory synapses were not associated with GABAA Rs. Crucially, we demonstrated for a subset of these novel proteins (including cullin1, ephexin, potassium channel tetramerization domain containing protein 12, mitofusin2, metabotropic glutamate receptor 5, p21-activated kinase 7, and Ras-related protein 5A) bind directly to the intracellular domains of GABAA Rs, validating our proteomic analysis. Thus, our experiments illustrate the complexity of the GABAA R proteome and enhance our understanding of the mechanisms neurons use to construct inhibitory synapses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Domain-containing proteins", "G protein coupled receptors", "Gamma-aminobutyric acids", "Green fluorescent protein", "Metabotropic glutamate receptors", "Postsynaptic densities", "Protein phosphorylation", "Receptor-associated proteins", "Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "HEK293 Cells", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Mass Spectrometry", "Mice, 129 Strain", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons", "Proteome", "Proteomics", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Synapses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974603488", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57192949688": {"Name": "Nakamura Y.", "AuthorID": "57192949688", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "56663934300": {"Name": "Morrow D.H.", "AuthorID": "56663934300", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "36809897600": {"Name": "Modgil A.", "AuthorID": "36809897600", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "16052668300": {"Name": "Huyghe D.", "AuthorID": "16052668300", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "13404206900": {"Name": "Deeb T.Z.", "AuthorID": "13404206900", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "55293068200": {"Name": "Davies P.A.", "AuthorID": "55293068200", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University, School of Medicine"}, "7402067232": {"Name": "Moss S.J.", "AuthorID": "7402067232", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College"}, "57215672401": {"Name": "Lumb M.J.", "AuthorID": "57215672401", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College"}}}
