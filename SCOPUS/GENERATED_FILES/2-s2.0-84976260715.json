In this article, we review the current understanding on the pathophysiology, the diagnostic criteria and the available therapeutic options for patients with emerging hepatic syndromes in cirrhosis, namely the hepatorenal, hepato-adrenal and hepatopulmonary syndrome. The hepatorenal syndrome is a well-recognized complication of advanced cirrhosis and is usually associated with an accelerated course to death unless liver transplantation is performed. The hepatopulmonary syndrome is often missed in the evaluation of patients with cirrhosis; however, early recognition is essential for the efficient management of individual patients. The hepato-adrenal syndrome, although not fully characterized, offers an exciting field for research and potential therapeutic interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cirrhosis", "Hepato-adrenal", "Hepatopulmonary", "Hepatorenal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Adrenal Insufficiency", "Ascites", "Creatinine", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Hepatorenal Syndrome", "Humans", "Hypertension, Portal", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver Transplantation", "Lypressin", "Midodrine", "Norepinephrine", "Octreotide", "Plasma Substitutes", "Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic", "Serum Albumin", "Vasodilator Agents", "Vasopressins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976260715", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"]], "AuthorData": {"6701614804": {"Name": "Bertino G.", "AuthorID": "6701614804", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania"}, "55597869500": {"Name": "Demma S.", "AuthorID": "55597869500", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania"}, "55597607700": {"Name": "Crisafulli E.", "AuthorID": "55597607700", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania"}, "57194561895": {"Name": "Privitera G.", "AuthorID": "57194561895", "AffiliationID": "60010146, 60010444", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania"}, "7003540633": {"Name": "Purrello F.", "AuthorID": "7003540633", "AffiliationID": "60010146, 60010444", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania"}, "23669127500": {"Name": "Spadaro L.", "AuthorID": "23669127500", "AffiliationID": "60010146, 60010444", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania"}, "47962127500": {"Name": "Koukias N.", "AuthorID": "47962127500", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health and Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.A.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health and Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}}}
