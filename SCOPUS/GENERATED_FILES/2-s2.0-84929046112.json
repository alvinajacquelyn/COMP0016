Social interactions with primary caregivers may play a key role in the development of this complex ability. This study aimed to investigate how variations in parenting behavior affect infants' neural responses to emotional faces. Event-related potentials (ERPs) to emotional faces were recorded from 40 healthy 7-month-old infants (24 males). Parental behavior was assessed and coded using the Emotional Availability Scales during free-play interaction. Sensitive parenting was associated with increased amplitudes to positive facial expressions on the face-sensitive ERP component, the negative central. Findings are discussed in relation to the interactive mechanisms influencing how infants neurally encode positive emotions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral Cortex", "Child Development", "Emotions", "Evoked Potentials", "Facial Expression", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Mother-Child Relations", "Parenting", "Temperament"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929046112", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"56520369700": {"Name": "Taylor-Colls S.", "AuthorID": "56520369700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Developmental Neuroscience Unit, Anna Freud Centre"}, "6503879291": {"Name": "Pasco Fearon R.M.", "AuthorID": "6503879291", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170329", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Developmental Neuroscience Unit, Anna Freud Centre"}}}
