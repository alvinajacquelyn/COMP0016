Our goal was to record and chart the children\u2019s social engagement \u2013 measured using interpersonal movement synchrony \u2013 as they took part in a theatrical workshop that was specifically designed to enhance their social skills. Interpersonal synchrony, an important factor of social engagement that is known to be impaired in autism, is calculated using a cross-wavelet similarity comparison between participants\u2019 movement data. We evaluate the feasibility of the approach over 3 live performances, each lasting 2 hours, using 6 actors and a total of 10 autistic children. We show that by visualising each child\u2019s engagement over the course of a performance, it is possible to highlight subtle moments of social coordination that might otherwise be lost when reviewing video footage alone. This is important because it points the way to a new method for people who work with autistic children to be able to monitor the development of those in their care, and to adapt their therapeutic activities accordingly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerometers", "Autism", "Cross wavelet", "Interpersonal synchrony", "Theatre", "Wearable sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autism", "Cross wavelet", "Interpersonal synchrony", "Theatre", "Wearable sensing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056888795", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57196494666": {"Name": "Ward J.A.", "AuthorID": "57196494666", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7403445239": {"Name": "Richardson D.", "AuthorID": "7403445239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14123619400": {"Name": "Orgs G.", "AuthorID": "14123619400", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Goldsmiths"}, "57204727014": {"Name": "Hunter K.", "AuthorID": "57204727014", "AffiliationID": "121665363", "AffiliationName": "Flute Theatre"}}}
