This paper analyses morphodynamic change of a complex estuary inlet which is subjected to multiple environmental drivers and proposes a reduced physics model to explain the historic medium term morphodynamic change of the inlet. The analysis shows that even though the estuary inlet undergoes multiscale morphological change, the changes that take place over a timescale of several years are more significant and important. The reduced physics model suggests that this simplified modelling approach is able to recognise principal historic morphodynamic trends in the estuary. However, the length and quality of the inlet bathymetry data set limits the applicability of the models and the quality of model outputs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deben estuary", "Diffusion coefficient", "Estuary morphodynamics", "Reduced-physics model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Medium term", "Model outputs", "Morphodynamics", "Morphological changes", "nocv1", "Paper analysis", "Physics modeling", "Simplified modelling", "Time-scales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001949371", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"6507503264": {"Name": "Karunarathna H.", "AuthorID": "6507503264", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Energy and the Environment Research Group, Zienkiewitcz Centre for Computational Engineering, College of Engineering, Swansea University"}, "22937834800": {"Name": "Horrillo-Caraballo J.", "AuthorID": "22937834800", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Energy and the Environment Research Group, Zienkiewitcz Centre for Computational Engineering, College of Engineering, Swansea University"}, "7102510774": {"Name": "Reeve D.", "AuthorID": "7102510774", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Energy and the Environment Research Group, Zienkiewitcz Centre for Computational Engineering, College of Engineering, Swansea University"}, "10540040600": {"Name": "Burningham H.", "AuthorID": "10540040600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Coastal & Estuarine Research Unit, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7402713520": {"Name": "Pan S.", "AuthorID": "7402713520", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}}}
