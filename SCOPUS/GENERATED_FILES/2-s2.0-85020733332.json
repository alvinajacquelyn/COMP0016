We hypothesised that blood pressure would fall following administration of paracetamol in critically-ill children and this effect would be greater during fever and among children with a high body surface area to weight ratio. Methods A 12-month prospective observational study of children (0\u201316 years) admitted to paediatric intensive care, who underwent pulse contour analysis and received paracetamol concurrently. Results Mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly by 4.7% from baseline (95% CI 1.75\u20138.07%) in 31 children following 148 doses of paracetamol. The nadir was 2-hour post-dose. The effect was pronounced in children with fever at baseline (6.4%, 95% CI 2.8\u201310%), although this was not statistically significant. There was no simple relationship between this effect and body surface area to weight ratio. The association between a change in blood pressure and changes in heart rate or measured stroke volume was poor; therefore it was likely that a change in the systemic vascular resistance contributes most to this effect. Conclusion There is a significant but modest reduction in blood pressure post-paracetamol in critically-ill children. This is likely related to a change in systemic vascular resistance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child", "Critical care", "Fever", "Paracetamol", "Physiologic monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetaminophen", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic", "Blood Pressure", "Child", "Child, Hospitalized", "Child, Preschool", "Critical Illness", "Female", "Fever", "Heart Rate", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Prospective Studies", "Vascular Resistance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020733332", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"56801266700": {"Name": "Ray S.", "AuthorID": "56801266700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Anaesthesia and Critical Care Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56145462600": {"Name": "Brick T.", "AuthorID": "56145462600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "36022965700": {"Name": "Raman S.", "AuthorID": "36022965700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Anaesthesia and Critical Care Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7402415882": {"Name": "Peters M.J.", "AuthorID": "7402415882", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Anaesthesia and Critical Care Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "47161022500": {"Name": "Birrell P.J.", "AuthorID": "47161022500", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit, Institute of Public Health"}, "7201775981": {"Name": "Klein N.J.", "AuthorID": "7201775981", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Inflammation and Rheumatology Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
