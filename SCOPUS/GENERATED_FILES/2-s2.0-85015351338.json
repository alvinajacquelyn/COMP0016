All rights reserved.Headaches are a common complaint in HIV positive patients attending emergency services. A thorough understanding of the differential diagnoses, initial investigations and empirical management of this presentation is essential for the assessing physician. We discuss a case of a patient with known advanced HIV infection presenting with headache to the emergency department. Given the range of possible diagnoses, broadspectrum antimicrobial therapy was initially commenced. This was stopped when magnetic resonance imaging confi rmed a diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy was started in accordance with current clinical guidelines after discussing the rationale and options for treatment with the patient. Here, we review the guidelines and supporting evidence for management of venous sinus thrombosis, and consider the challenges and strategies for engaging a patient with previous poor attendance in their ongoing care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anticoagulation", "Headache", "HIV", "Tumour", "Venous sinus thrombosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anticoagulants", "Brain", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Headache", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Male", "Sinus Thrombosis, Intracranial"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015351338", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56245333200": {"Name": "Creamer A.", "AuthorID": "56245333200", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London"}, "57192365456": {"Name": "Ioannidis S.", "AuthorID": "57192365456", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London"}, "56419584900": {"Name": "Wilhelm T.", "AuthorID": "56419584900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London"}, "57192366091": {"Name": "Mahangu T.", "AuthorID": "57192366091", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London"}}}
