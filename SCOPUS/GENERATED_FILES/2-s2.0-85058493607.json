This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.The Sharing Economy (SE) is a growing ecosystem focusing on peer-to-peer enterprise. In the SE the information available to assist individuals (users) in making decisions focuses predominantly on community-generated trust and reputation information. However, how such information impacts user judgement is still being understood. To explore such effects, we constructed an artificial SE accommodation platform where we varied the elements related to hosts\u2019 digital identity, measuring users\u2019 perceptions and decisions to interact. Across three studies, we find that trust and reputation information increases not only the users\u2019 perceived trustworthiness, credibility, and sociability of hosts, but also the propensity to rent a private room in their home. This effect is seen when providing users both with complete profiles and profiles with partial user-selected information. Closer investigations reveal that three elements relating to the host\u2019s digital identity are sufficient to produce such positive perceptions and increased rental decisions, regardless of which three elements are presented. Our findings have relevant implications for human judgment and privacy in the SE, and question its current culture of ever increasing information-sharing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Economics", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Trust", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058493607", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57202874230": {"Name": "Zloteanu M.", "AuthorID": "57202874230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering, University College London"}, "35366644500": {"Name": "Livan G.", "AuthorID": "35366644500", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}, "57206194829": {"Name": "Harvey N.", "AuthorID": "57206194829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6602003712": {"Name": "Tuckett D.", "AuthorID": "6602003712", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Decision-Making Uncertainty, University College London"}}}
