By addressing the impacts of employing different numbers of antennas and bandwidths at lower and higher frequencies, we evaluate the amount of harvested energy and throughput in such networks. Based on the derived results, we obtain the required small cell density to achieve an expected level of harvested energy or throughput. Also, we obtain that when the ratio of the number of sub-6-GHz BSs to that of the mmWave BSs is lower than a given threshold, UE harvests more energy from an mmWave BS than a sub-6-GHz BS. We find how many mmWave small cells are needed to perform better than the sub-6-GHz small cells from the perspectives of harvested energy and throughput. Our results reveal that the amount of harvested energy from the mmWave tier can be comparable to the sub-6-GHz counterpart in the dense scenarios. For the same tier scale, mmWave tier can achieve higher throughput. Furthermore, the throughput gap between different mmWave frequencies increases with the mmWave BS density.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dense small cells", "Millimeter wave (mmWave)", "throughput", "wireless power transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular network", "Millimeter waves (mmwave)", "Mobile communications", "Radio frequencies", "Small cells", "Wireless communications", "Wireless power transfer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023754129", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56072896600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56072896600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55934670700": {"Name": "Heath R.", "AuthorID": "55934670700", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55549083700": {"Name": "Yuan J.", "AuthorID": "55549083700", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales"}}}
