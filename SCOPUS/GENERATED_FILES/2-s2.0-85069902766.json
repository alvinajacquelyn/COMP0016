GP and DP models and their stability, antecedents and outcomes are studied in a longitudinal sample of 1073 children (49.8% female). GP and DP models were estimated at ages 8 and 14 years using the parent-reported Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self Report (YSR). Early childhood antecedents and adolescent outcomes were derived using a multi-method multi-informant approach. Results showed that the general GP and DP had similar key symptoms and were similarly related to early-childhood antecedents (e.g., lower effortful control, higher maternal depression) and adolescent outcomes (e.g., reduced academic functioning, poorer mental health). This study demonstrates that GP and DP are highly similar constructs in middle childhood and adolescence, both describing a general vulnerability for psychopathology with (emotional) dysregulation at its core. Scientific integration of these approaches could lead to a better understanding of the structure, antecedents and outcomes of psychopathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bifactor model", "Child Behavior Checklist", "Comorbidity", "Dysregulation", "p factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Personality Tests", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Self Report"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069902766", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56117287000": {"Name": "Deutz M.H.F.", "AuthorID": "56117287000", "AffiliationID": "60022265", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Education & Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "56685858200": {"Name": "Geeraerts S.B.", "AuthorID": "56685858200", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Studies, Utrecht University"}, "6701827782": {"Name": "Dekovi\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "6701827782", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Studies, Utrecht University"}, "6701444702": {"Name": "van Baar A.L.", "AuthorID": "6701444702", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Studies, Utrecht University"}, "6505835155": {"Name": "Prinzie P.", "AuthorID": "6505835155", "AffiliationID": "60022265", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Education & Child Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam"}, "7006451757": {"Name": "Belsky J.", "AuthorID": "7006451757", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "55746318400": {"Name": "Patalay P.", "AuthorID": "55746318400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
