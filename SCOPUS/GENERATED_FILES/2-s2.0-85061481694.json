The specific insulation materials correspond to rigid closed-cell plastic foams, a type of polyisocyanurate (foam A) and a type of phenolic foam (foam B), whose thermal decomposition and flammability were characterised in previous studies. The assemblies were instrumented with thermocouples. The plasterboard facing was subjected to constant levels of irradiation of 15, 25, and 65 kW m\u22122 using the heat-transfer rate inducing system. These experiments serve as (1) an assessment of the fire behaviour of these materials studied at the assembly scale and (2) an identification of the fire hazards that these systems pose in building construction. The manifestation of the hazards occurred via initial pyrolysis reactions and release of volatiles followed by various complex behaviours including char oxidation (smouldering), cracking, and expansion of the foam. Gas-phase conditions may support ignition of the volatiles, sustained burning, and ultimately spread of the flame through the unexposed insulation face. The results presented herein are used to validate the insulation \u201ccritical temperature\u201d concept used for a performance-based methodology focused on the selection of suitable thermal barriers for flammable insulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["charring foams", "insulation materials", "plasterboard", "pyrolysis", "smouldering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical temperatures", "Heat transfer rate", "Insulation materials", "Performance based", "plasterboard", "Pyrolysis reaction", "smouldering", "Sustained burning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061481694", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"56903753000": {"Name": "Hidalgo J.", "AuthorID": "56903753000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering, Institute for Infrastructure and Environment, The University of Edinburgh"}, "7101674199": {"Name": "Welch S.", "AuthorID": "7101674199", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, BRE Centre for Fire Safety Engineering, Institute for Infrastructure and Environment, The University of Edinburgh"}, "7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
