This paper presents a critical evaluation of the inductor characteristics of circular weft knitted coils for applications in e-textiles. Inductors are knitted using circular needles with thin insulated metal wire and yarn knitted together. The resulting helical coils are characterized as a function of number of turns, coil diameter, needle size, and insulated metal wire material. The results are compared to wound coils. Simulations of the knitted and wound coils show close agreement with the experimental results and confirm a higher inductance for the knits compared to the wound coils with the same pitch between turns. The parasitic coil capacitance is higher in the knit due to the vertical legs of the stitches, absent in wound coils. Knits with thin Cu and Litz wires result in flexible and wearable textile coils.", "AuthorKeywords": ["circular weft knit", "Flexible coils", "smart textiles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coil diameter", "Critical evaluation", "Flexible coils", "Health monitoring", "Helical coil", "Inductor coils", "Metal wires", "Weft knit"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070946109", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56277589700": {"Name": "Fobelets K.", "AuthorID": "56277589700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London"}, "57210571711": {"Name": "Mathivanan A.", "AuthorID": "57210571711", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London"}, "6701426596": {"Name": "Papavassiliou C.", "AuthorID": "6701426596", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department, Imperial College London"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Hospital, Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}}}
