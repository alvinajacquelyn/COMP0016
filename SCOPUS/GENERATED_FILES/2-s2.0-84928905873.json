Here we analyze the effect of weighted decomposition on the performance of the HemeLB lattice-Boltzmann simulation environment, when applied to sparse domains. Prior to domain decomposition, we assign wall and in/outlet sites with increased weights which reflect their increased computational cost. We combine our weighted decomposition with a second optimization, which is to sort the lattice sites according to a space filling curve. We tested these strategies on a sparse bifurcation and very sparse aneurysm geometry, and find that using weights reduces calculation load imbalance by up to 85%, although the overall communication overhead is higher than some of our runs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domain decomposition", "High performance computing", "Lattice-Boltzmann"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communication overheads", "Computational costs", "High performance computing", "Lattice boltzmann", "Lattice Boltzmann simulations", "Second optimization", "Space-filling curve", "Weighted decomposition"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928905873", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"23049787700": {"Name": "Groen D.", "AuthorID": "23049787700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "56623041900": {"Name": "Chacra D.", "AuthorID": "56623041900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "55631933500": {"Name": "Nash R.", "AuthorID": "55631933500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "14053541200": {"Name": "Bernabeu M.", "AuthorID": "14053541200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "13408713400": {"Name": "Jaros J.", "AuthorID": "13408713400", "AffiliationID": "60013826", "AffiliationName": "Brno University of Technology"}}}
