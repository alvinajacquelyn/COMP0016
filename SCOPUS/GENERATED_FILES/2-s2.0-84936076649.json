Studies in rodents suggest that information flow to the nucleus accumbens may be regulated via task-dependent oscillatory coupling between regions. During instrumental behavior, local field potentials (LFP) in the rat nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex are coupled at delta frequencies (Gruber AJ, Hussain RJ, O\u2019Donnell P. PLoS One 4: e5062, 2009), possibly mediating suppression of afferent input from other areas and thereby supporting cortical control (Calhoon GG, O\u2019Donnell P. Neuron 78: 181\u2013190, 2013). In this report, we demonstrate low-frequency cortico-accumbens coupling in humans, both at rest and during a decision-making task. We recorded LFP from the nucleus accumbens in six epilepsy patients who underwent implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes. All patients showed significant coherence and phase-synchronization between LFP and surface EEG at delta and low theta frequencies. Although the direction of this coupling as indexed by Granger causality varied between subjects in the resting-state data, all patients showed a cortical drive of the nucleus accumbens during action selection in a decision-making task. In three patients this was accompanied by a significant coherence increase over baseline. Our results suggest that low-frequency corticoaccumbens coupling represents a highly conserved regulatory mechanism for action selection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action selection", "Deep brain stimulation", "Local field potentials", "Nucleus accumbens", "Synchronization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cerebral Cortex", "Decision Making", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Delta Rhythm", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Implantable Neurostimulators", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Nucleus Accumbens", "Periodicity", "Psychomotor Performance", "Rest", "Theta Rhythm"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936076649", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"25228089900": {"Name": "Stenner M.", "AuthorID": "25228089900", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "23995713600": {"Name": "Litvak V.", "AuthorID": "23995713600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7101911123": {"Name": "Rutledge R.", "AuthorID": "7101911123", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London, Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London, Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "7801660336": {"Name": "Zaehle T.", "AuthorID": "7801660336", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "35952175000": {"Name": "Schmitt F.", "AuthorID": "35952175000", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "7103232231": {"Name": "Heinze H.", "AuthorID": "7103232231", "AffiliationID": "60020075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Neurology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology"}, "7003574897": {"Name": "Voges J.", "AuthorID": "7003574897", "AffiliationID": "60020075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Neurology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology"}}}
