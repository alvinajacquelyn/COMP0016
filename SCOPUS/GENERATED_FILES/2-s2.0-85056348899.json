Here, we review the increasing number of reported families and isolated cases have been reported with a variety of different pathogenic variants. The spectrum of clinical features is expanding with early-onset seizures as a frequent comorbidity in both affected male and female patients. There is a growing number of female patients with de novo loss-of-function variants in IQSEC2 have a more severe phenotype than the heterozygous state would predict, particularly if IQSEC2 is thought to escape X-inactivation. Interestingly, these findings highlight that the classical understanding of X-linked inheritance does not readily explain the emergence of these affected females, warranting further investigations into the underlying mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affected females", "escape X-inactivation", "intellectual disability", "IQSEC2", "seizures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Epilepsy", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Mutation", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056348899", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6602543742": {"Name": "Shoubridge C.", "AuthorID": "6602543742", "AffiliationID": "60189792, 60009512", "AffiliationName": "Robinson Research Institute, University of Adelaide"}, "57203196300": {"Name": "Harvey R.J.", "AuthorID": "57203196300", "AffiliationID": "60159369", "AffiliationName": "Sunshine Coast Health Institute"}, "6701579672": {"Name": "Dudding-Byth T.", "AuthorID": "6701579672", "AffiliationID": "60017054, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "Grow-Up-Well Priority Research Centre, University of Newcastle"}}}
