Neither is there evidence of which we are aware to favour the notion that the entity is a return to a phenotype seen in cold-blooded animals. It is also known that when seen in adults, the presence of excessive ventricular trabeculations does not portend a poor prognosis when the ejection fraction is normal, with the risks of complications such as arrhythmia and stroke being rare in this setting. It is also the case that images of \u201cnoncompaction\u201d as provided from children or autopsy studies are quite different from the features observed clinically in asymptomatic adults with excessive trabeculation. Our review suggests that the presence of an excessively trabeculated left ventricular wall is not in itself a clinical entity. It is equally possible that the excessive trabeculation is no more than a bystander in the presence of additional lesions such as dilated cardiomyopathy, with the additional lesions being responsible for the reduced ejection fraction bringing a given patient to clinical attention. We, therefore, argue that the term \u201cnoncompaction cardiomyopathy\u201d is misleading, because there is neither failure of compaction nor a cardiomyopathic process in most individuals that fulfill widely used diagnostic criteria.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Isolated Noncompaction of the Ventricular Myocardium", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017185375", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Sciences, University College London"}, "35746198000": {"Name": "Jensen B.", "AuthorID": "35746198000", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "7004364635": {"Name": "Mohun T.J.", "AuthorID": "7004364635", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Medical Research"}, "35430477200": {"Name": "Petersen S.E.", "AuthorID": "35430477200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit at Barts, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55785914100": {"Name": "Aung N.", "AuthorID": "55785914100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit at Barts, Queen Mary University of London"}, "53865866400": {"Name": "Zemrak F.", "AuthorID": "53865866400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit at Barts, Queen Mary University of London"}, "12774748100": {"Name": "Planken R.N.", "AuthorID": "12774748100", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "56890941200": {"Name": "MacIver D.H.", "AuthorID": "56890941200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}}}
