This is a well known financial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is uninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one would not expect profits from such strategies. That is, according to uncovered interest rate parity (UIP), changes in the related exchange rates should offset the potential to profit from such interest rate differentials. However, it has been shown empirically, that investors can earn profits on average by borrowing in a country with a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a higher interest rate, whilst allowing for any losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. This paper explores the financial risk that trading strategies seeking to exploit a violation of the UIP condition are exposed to with respect to multivariate tail dependence present in both the funding and investment currency baskets. It will outline in what contexts these portfolio risk exposures will benefit accumulated portfolio returns and under what conditions such tail exposures will reduce portfolio returns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Currency carry trade", "Forward premium puzzle", "Generalised archimedean copula", "Mixture models", "Multivariate tail dependence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Archimedean copula", "Domestic currency", "Foreign countries", "Forward premium puzzle", "Investment strategy", "Mixture model", "Tail dependence", "Trading strategies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920934190", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"56480173600": {"Name": "Ames M.", "AuthorID": "56480173600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "55764426800": {"Name": "Peters G.", "AuthorID": "55764426800", "AffiliationID": "60112639, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford-Man Institute, Oxford University"}, "56480793000": {"Name": "Bagnarosa G.", "AuthorID": "56480793000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, ESC Rennes School of Business, University College London"}, "35198281300": {"Name": "Kosmidis I.", "AuthorID": "35198281300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
