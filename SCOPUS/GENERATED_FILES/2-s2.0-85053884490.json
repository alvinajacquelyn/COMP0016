Some keywords, such as resilience, have an extensive literature on definitions, meanings, and interpretations. Other terms have been less explored. This article investigates core disaster risk science vocabulary that has not received extensive attention in terms of examining the meanings, interpretations, and connotations based on key United Nations glossaries. The terms covered are hazard, vulnerability, disaster risk, and the linked concepts of disaster risk reduction and disaster risk management. Following a presentation and analysis of the glossary-based definitions, discussion draws out understandings of disasters and disaster risk science, which the glossaries do not fully provide in depth, especially vulnerability and disasters as processes. Application of the results leads to considering the possibility of a focus on risk rather than disaster risk while simplifying vocabulary by moving away from disaster risk reduction and disaster risk management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disaster risk", "Disaster risk management (DRM)", "Disaster risk reduction (DRR)", "Hazard", "Vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053884490", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60080184", "AffiliationName": "University of Agder"}}}
