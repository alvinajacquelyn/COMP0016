In experiment 1, we used a new two-alternative-forced-choice method with a roving pedestal designed to minimise cognitive biases. Here, children judged which of two comparison stimuli was most similar in size to a reference stimulus. In experiments 2 and 3, we used methods previously used with autistic populations. In experiment 2, children judged whether stimuli were the 'same' or 'different', and in experiment 3, we used a method-of-adjustment task.RESULTS: Across all tasks, autistic children were equally susceptible to the Ebbinghaus illusion as typically developing children. Autistic children showed a heightened susceptibility to the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, but only in the method-of-adjustment task. This result may reflect differences in decisional criteria.CONCLUSIONS: Our results are inconsistent with theories proposing reduced contextual integration in autism and suggest that previous reports of altered susceptibility to illusions may arise from differences in decision-making, rather than differences in perception per se. Our findings help to elucidate the underlying reasons for atypical responses to perceptual illusions in autism and call for the use of methods that reduce cognitive bias when measuring illusion susceptibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "Cognitive bias", "Context", "Global processing", "Perception", "Response bias", "Vision", "Visual illusions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Autistic Disorder", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Optical Illusions", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Photic Stimulation", "Size Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019187994", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55350768800": {"Name": "Manning C.", "AuthorID": "55350768800", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Western Australia"}, "57207295448": {"Name": "Morgan M.", "AuthorID": "57207295448", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Western Australia"}, "57194630647": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "57194630647", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Western Australia"}, "6507658484": {"Name": "Pellicano E.", "AuthorID": "6507658484", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Western Australia"}}}
