Direct current electric fields were applied and increased in a range of 0 to 30 V during the reaction. Changes in particle size, agglomeration and particle shape were observed. Raman spectroscopy analysis revealed different composition of anatase and rutile and crystal phase depending on the field strength applied. The photocatalytic activity was calculated from the half-life or time needed by the films to degrade 50% Resazurin dye-ink initial concentration. High photocatalytic performance with high anatase content (98.3%) was observed with half-life values of 3.9 min. Deposited films with pure content in rutile showed better photocatalytic performance than films with mix of crystal phases with anatase content below 40%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aerosol assisted", "CVD", "DC electric fields", "Photocatalysis", "Titanium (IV) chloride"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Chemical vapour deposition", "Dc electric field", "Direct current electric fields", "Photocatalytic activities", "Photocatalytic performance", "Titanium chloride", "Titanium dioxide thin film"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928597740", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55754732600": {"Name": "Romero L.", "AuthorID": "55754732600", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7801602505": {"Name": "Binions R.", "AuthorID": "7801602505", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56516929900": {"Name": "Jorge-Sobrido A.", "AuthorID": "56516929900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Building (Chemistry), University College of London"}, "56516979500": {"Name": "McMillian P.", "AuthorID": "56516979500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Building (Chemistry), University College of London"}}}
