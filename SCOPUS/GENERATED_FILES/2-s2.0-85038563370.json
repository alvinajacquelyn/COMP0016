Herein we use piperacillin hypersensitivity as a model to explore the reactivity of drug-specific IgG against alternative \u03b2-lactam protein adducts. Mass spectrometry was used to show the drugs (amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, benzyl penicillin, aztreonam, and piperacillin) bind to similar lysine residues on the protein carrier bovine serum albumin. However, the hapten-specific IgG antibodies found in piperacillin hypersensitive patient plasma did not bind to other \u03b2-lactam protein conjugates. These data outline the fine specificity of piperacillin-specific IgG antibodies that circulate in patients with hypersensitivity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "beta-Lactams", "Drug Hypersensitivity", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Piperacillin", "Protein Binding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038563370", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"]], "AuthorData": {"57192427116": {"Name": "Amali M.O.", "AuthorID": "57192427116", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "7402398972": {"Name": "Jenkins R.E.", "AuthorID": "7402398972", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "15136654200": {"Name": "Meng X.", "AuthorID": "15136654200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "7103404706": {"Name": "Faulkner L.", "AuthorID": "7103404706", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "35478124100": {"Name": "Park B.K.", "AuthorID": "35478124100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "6603779088": {"Name": "Naisbitt D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603779088", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "26634614800": {"Name": "Whitaker P.", "AuthorID": "26634614800", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Regional Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit, St. James's Hospital"}, "7005935206": {"Name": "Peckham D.", "AuthorID": "7005935206", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Regional Adult Cystic Fibrosis Unit, St. James's Hospital"}}}
