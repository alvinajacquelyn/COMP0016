Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.An important component in bioimpedance measurements is the current driver, which can operate over a wide range of impedance and frequency. This paper provides a review of integrated circuit analog current drivers which have been developed in the last 10 years. Important features for current drivers are high output impedance, low phase delay, and low harmonic distortion. In this paper, the analog current drivers are grouped into two categories based on open loop or closed loop designs. The characteristics of each design are identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioimpedance measurement", "Current driver", "Integrated circuit", "Linear feedback", "Nonlinear feedback", "Transconductance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analog current", "Bio-impedance", "Bioimpedance measurement", "Closed-loop design", "Current drivers", "Important features", "Integrated currents", "Linear feedback", "Algorithms", "Dielectric Spectroscopy", "Electric Impedance", "Finite Element Analysis", "Humans", "Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061844592", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"38961723700": {"Name": "Neshatvar N.", "AuthorID": "38961723700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36936417600": {"Name": "Langlois P.", "AuthorID": "36936417600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603764288": {"Name": "Bayford R.", "AuthorID": "6603764288", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
