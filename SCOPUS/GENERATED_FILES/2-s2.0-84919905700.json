Mouse lines derived from the early blastocyst and from primordial germ cells (PGCs) can contribute to all somatic lineages and to the germ line, whereas cells from slightly later embryos (EpiSC) no longer contribute to the germ line. In chick, pluripotent ESCs can be obtained from PGCs and from early blastoderms. Established PGC lines and freshly isolated blastodermal cells (cBC) can contribute to both germinal and somatic lineages but established lines from the former (cESC) can only produce somatic cell types. For this reason, cESCs are often considered to be equivalent to mouse EpiSC. To define these cell types more rigorously, we have performed comparative microarray analysis to describe a transcriptomic profile specific for each cell type. This is validated by real time RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation. We find that both cES and cBC cells express classic pluripotency-related genes (including cPOUV/OCT4, NANOG, SOX2/3, KLF2 and SALL4), whereas expression of DAZL, DND1, DDX4 and PIWIL1 defines a molecular signature for germ cells. Surprisingly, contrary to the prevailing view, our results also suggest that cES cells resemble mouse ES cells more closely than mouse EpiSC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Argonaute Proteins", "Blastocyst", "Cells, Cultured", "Chickens", "Cluster Analysis", "DEAD-box RNA Helicases", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Germ Cells", "In Situ Hybridization", "Mice", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Principal Component Analysis", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919905700", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55533527200": {"Name": "Jean C.", "AuthorID": "55533527200", "AffiliationID": "60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, UMR S 846"}, "56462963200": {"Name": "Fuet A.", "AuthorID": "56462963200", "AffiliationID": "60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, UMR S 846"}, "56462718100": {"Name": "Mazoyer C.", "AuthorID": "56462718100", "AffiliationID": "60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, UMR S 846"}, "55533957200": {"Name": "Aubel P.", "AuthorID": "55533957200", "AffiliationID": "60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, UMR S 846"}, "57203054551": {"Name": "Pain B.", "AuthorID": "57203054551", "AffiliationID": "60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, UMR S 846"}, "57209079309": {"Name": "Oliveira N.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57209079309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "55799724200": {"Name": "Intarapat S.", "AuthorID": "55799724200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "23977793700": {"Name": "De Almeida I.", "AuthorID": "23977793700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "37120992500": {"Name": "Trevers K.", "AuthorID": "37120992500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6602905803": {"Name": "Boast S.", "AuthorID": "6602905803", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6506015825": {"Name": "Bertocchini F.", "AuthorID": "6506015825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7201805780": {"Name": "Stern C.D.", "AuthorID": "7201805780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
