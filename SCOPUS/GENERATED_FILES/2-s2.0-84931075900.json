Emergent awareness refers to a specific facet of motor unawareness in which anosognosic subjects recognise their motor deficits only when they have been requested to perform an action and they realise their errors. Four participants in the chronic phase after a stroke with anosognosia for hemiplegia were recruited. They took part in an \"error-full\" or \"analysis of error-based\" rehabilitative training programme. They were asked to attempt to execute specific actions, analyse their own strategies and errors and discuss the reasons for their failures. Pre- and post-training and follow-up assessments showed that motor unawareness improved in all four patients. These results indicate that unsuccessful action attempts with concomitant error analysis may facilitate the recovery of emergent awareness and, sometimes, of more general aspects of awareness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action planning", "Anosognosia for hemiplegia", "Emergent awareness", "Judgments of Action Test", "Rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Agnosia", "Awareness", "Brain", "Hemiplegia", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychomotor Performance", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931075900", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"6603640267": {"Name": "Moro V.", "AuthorID": "6603640267", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, Education and Psychology, University of Verona"}, "53878602000": {"Name": "Scandola M.", "AuthorID": "53878602000", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "IRCSS Santa Lucia"}, "54406565100": {"Name": "Bulgarelli C.", "AuthorID": "54406565100", "AffiliationID": "60108138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation, Sacro Cuore Hospital"}, "6507026143": {"Name": "Avesani R.", "AuthorID": "6507026143", "AffiliationID": "60108138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rehabilitation, Sacro Cuore Hospital"}, "26767738700": {"Name": "Fotopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "26767738700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
