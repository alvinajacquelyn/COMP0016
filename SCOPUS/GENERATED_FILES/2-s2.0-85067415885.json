Optimizing for airline cost for hypothetical disruptive events suggests that, for airport closures of up to 10 h, airlines could benefit from up to a 20% reduction in passenger delay-related costs. The mean passenger delay could be reduced by up to 70%, mainly via a reduction in very long delays.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Airline costs", "Aviation systems", "Collaborative decision making", "Coordinated strategies", "Disruptive event", "European airports", "Long delays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067415885", "SubjectAreas": [["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"6603160782": {"Name": "Dray L.", "AuthorID": "6603160782", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Energy Institute"}, "55672845100": {"Name": "Laplace I.", "AuthorID": "55672845100", "AffiliationID": "60083826, 60102124", "AffiliationName": "ENAC, University of Toulouse"}, "54791169900": {"Name": "Marzuoli A.", "AuthorID": "54791169900", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "57204341846": {"Name": "Feron E.", "AuthorID": "57204341846", "AffiliationID": "60019647", "AffiliationName": "Georgia Institute of Technology"}, "35514836700": {"Name": "Evans A.", "AuthorID": "35514836700", "AffiliationID": "60159764", "AffiliationName": "Crown Consulting, Inc., Moffett Field"}}}
