Using a well-characterised model of carcinogen-induced fibrosarcomas we show that the enriched tumor-infiltrating Treg population comprises largely of CXCR3+ T-bet+ 'TH1-like' Tregs which are thymus-derived Helios+ cells. Whilst IL-2 maintains homeostatic ratios of Tregs in lymphoid organs, we found that the perturbation in Treg frequencies in tumors is IL-2 independent. Moreover, we show that the TH1 phenotype of tumor-infiltrating Tregs is dispensable for their ability to influence tumor progression. We did however find that unlike Tconvs, the majority of intra-tumoral Tregs express the activation markers CD69, CD25, ICOS, CD103 and CTLA4 and are significantly more proliferative than Tconvs. Moreover, we have found that CD69+ Tregs are more suppressive than their CD69- counterparts. Collectively, these data indicate superior activation of Tregs in the tumor microenvironment, promoting their suppressive ability and selective proliferation at this site.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "CD69", "Immune response", "Immunity", "Immunology Section", "Proliferation", "T-bet", "Treg"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Fibrosarcoma", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "Inflammation Mediators", "Interleukin-2", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating", "Methylcholanthrene", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Phenotype", "Sarcoma, Experimental", "Signal Transduction", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Th1 Cells", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944463513", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56094804900": {"Name": "Colbeck E.J.", "AuthorID": "56094804900", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "23011938100": {"Name": "Hindley J.P.", "AuthorID": "23011938100", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "42462280800": {"Name": "Smart K.", "AuthorID": "42462280800", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "7404231899": {"Name": "Jones E.", "AuthorID": "7404231899", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "55887410200": {"Name": "Bloom A.", "AuthorID": "55887410200", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "55443015500": {"Name": "Bridgeman H.", "AuthorID": "55443015500", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "6507063190": {"Name": "Ladell K.", "AuthorID": "6507063190", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "7403719208": {"Name": "Price D.A.", "AuthorID": "7403719208", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "55887142300": {"Name": "Godkin A.J.", "AuthorID": "55887142300", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "7005402663": {"Name": "Gallimore A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005402663", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection Immunity and Biochemistry, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "55641594000": {"Name": "McPherson R.C.", "AuthorID": "55641594000", "AffiliationID": "60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Centre for Multiple Sclerosis Research and Centre for Immunity Infection and Evolution, University of Edinburgh"}, "8644363200": {"Name": "Turner D.G.", "AuthorID": "8644363200", "AffiliationID": "60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Centre for Multiple Sclerosis Research and Centre for Immunity Infection and Evolution, University of Edinburgh"}, "7202869110": {"Name": "O'Connor R.A.", "AuthorID": "7202869110", "AffiliationID": "60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Centre for Multiple Sclerosis Research and Centre for Immunity Infection and Evolution, University of Edinburgh"}, "7003918967": {"Name": "Anderton S.M.", "AuthorID": "7003918967", "AffiliationID": "60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Centre for Multiple Sclerosis Research and Centre for Immunity Infection and Evolution, University of Edinburgh"}}}
