In this work we examine the feasibility of using actor-reported 'anger scores', during a challenging communication scenario, as a tool to stimulate debriefing. Methods: This teaching session was delivered to 10 groups of final-year MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) students at Newcastle University. One student from each group took on the role of the foundation year 1 (F1) doctor and had 10 minutes to talk to an angry relative (actor), who was unhappy with the care her mother had received. During the scenario the actor recorded her level of anger on a 10-point Likert scale (1, 'no anger'; 10, 'extreme anger') at 1-minute intervals. Once the scenario was complete, the in-room tutor graphically presented these scores against time. During debriefing, students were asked to examine the graph produced: fluctuations in anger levels were identified, discussion was held regarding possible precipitants for the changes seen and strategies were developed for tackling future such incidents. Teaching communication skills using role-play addresses an important learning need for medical students Results: Examples of graphs produced during the session are presented, including annotations highlighting the discussion topics that arose. Feedback on the session from both students and actor was positive, with no reports that the scoring process interfered with the fidelity of the scenario. Discussion: We believe that actor-reported 'anger scores' provide a quick, simple and cheap method of producing a visual aid to the debriefing process that, in the context of a challenging communication scenario, provided a stimulus for discussion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anger", "Communication", "Education, Medical", "Humans", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Role Playing", "Students, Medical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925273581", "SubjectAreas": [["Review and Exam Preparation", "NURS", "2923"]], "AuthorData": {"56111849200": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "56111849200", "AffiliationID": "60014645", "AffiliationName": "Education Department, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56562640100": {"Name": "Norris L.", "AuthorID": "56562640100", "AffiliationID": "60014645", "AffiliationName": "Education Department, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55257028800": {"Name": "Keddie S.", "AuthorID": "55257028800", "AffiliationID": "60014645", "AffiliationName": "Education Department, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220640452": {"Name": "Thomson R.", "AuthorID": "57220640452", "AffiliationID": "60014645", "AffiliationName": "Education Department, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35067950100": {"Name": "Grogan E.", "AuthorID": "35067950100", "AffiliationID": "60014645", "AffiliationName": "Education Department, Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
