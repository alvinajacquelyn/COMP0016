In this work, a novel plasmonic particle-in-cavity nanoantenna (PIC-NA) is proposed. The second harmonic generation (SHG) of the PIC-NA under strong localized SP resonance is systematically analyzed by a self-consistent numerical solution based on boundary element method (BEM). The developed method solves the fundamental field and second harmonic (SH) field together iteratively to capture their mutual coupling. Strong enhancement of SHG from PIC-NA is achieved. The SHG enhancement factor is around four orders of magnitude, which is much higher than those achieved in literatures. Moreover, unidirectional SH radiation for the asymmetric PIC-NA is realized. Its emission direction can be controlled by the location of the nanosphere. The proposed novel plasmonic PIC-NA functions as the new synthetic second-order nonlinear optical material that has promising applications in the nonlinear sensing, spectroscopy and frequency generation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Frequency generation", "Nonlinear optical media", "Orders of magnitude", "Plasmonic nanostructures", "Plasmonic particles", "Second-harmonic fields", "Second-order nonlinear optical", "Strong enhancement"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992109279", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"55510328500": {"Name": "Xiong X.", "AuthorID": "55510328500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56353178500": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "56353178500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "53880066900": {"Name": "Lo Y.", "AuthorID": "53880066900", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "26643168800": {"Name": "Chew W.", "AuthorID": "26643168800", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}}}
