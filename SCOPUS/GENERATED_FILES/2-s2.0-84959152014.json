All rights reserved.There is a lack of evidence-based guidance for the prevention and management of thrombosis in children and young people treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To determine current UK practice, a survey was sent to 28 centers participating in the Medical Research Council UKALL 2011 trial. Marked variation in practice was noted. In total, 43% of centers defer central venous access device insertion until end of induction for treatment of low-risk disease. Central venous access devices are removed at the end of intensive blocks in 38% and end of treatment in 42%. Duration of anticoagulation for line-associated thrombosis is 6 weeks in 43% and 3 months in 33% and for cerebral sinovenous thrombosis is 3 months in 71% and 6 months in 24%. Platelet transfusion to maintain platelet count >50\u00d7109/L, in preference to interrupting therapeutic anticoagulation, is used by 50% for line-associated thrombosis and 73% for cerebral sinovenous thrombosis. Conformity of practice was seen in some areas. In total, 70% treat thrombosis with twice-daily low-molecular weight heparin and 86% monitor antifactor Xa activity levels. In total, 91% reexpose individuals to asparaginase following a thrombotic event. Given this variation in practice, in the absence of highquality evidence, consensus guidelines may be helpful.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute lymphoblastic leukemia", "Anticoagulation", "Central venous access device", "Thrombophilia", "Thrombosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Medical Oncology", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Thrombosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959152014", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56048280600": {"Name": "Biss T.T.", "AuthorID": "56048280600", "AffiliationID": "60024240, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Royal Victoria Infirmary"}, "57089725900": {"Name": "Payne J.H.", "AuthorID": "57089725900", "AffiliationID": "60002869", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Children's Hospital"}, "9941088900": {"Name": "Hough R.E.", "AuthorID": "9941088900", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "7102131809": {"Name": "Grainger J.D.", "AuthorID": "7102131809", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Royal Manchester Children's Hospital"}, "6506965482": {"Name": "Macartney C.", "AuthorID": "6506965482", "AffiliationID": "60028697", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belfast Children's Hospital"}, "15829908100": {"Name": "Sibson K.R.", "AuthorID": "15829908100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7003909314": {"Name": "Chalmers E.A.", "AuthorID": "7003909314", "AffiliationID": "60190225", "AffiliationName": "Royal Hospital for Children"}}}
