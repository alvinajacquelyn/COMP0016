To gain further insight into SAFB1 function we used iCLIP and mapped its interaction with RNA on a genome wide level. Results: iCLIP analysis found SAFB1 binding was enriched, specifically in exons, ncRNAs, 3' and 5' untranslated regions. SAFB1 was found to recognise a purine-rich GAAGA motif with the highest frequency and it is therefore likely to bind core AGA, GAA, or AAG motifs. Confirmatory RT-PCR experiments showed that the expression of coding and non-coding genes with SAFB1 cross-link sites was altered by SAFB1 knockdown. For example, we found that the isoform-specific expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM1) and ASTN2 was influenced by SAFB1 and that the processing of miR-19a from the miR-17-92 cluster was regulated by SAFB1. These data suggest SAFB1 may influence alternative splicing and, using an NCAM1 minigene, we showed that SAFB1 knockdown altered the expression of two of the three NCAM1 alternative spliced isoforms. However, when the AGA, GAA, and AAG motifs were mutated, SAFB1 knockdown no longer mediated a decrease in the NCAM1 9-10 alternative spliced form. To further investigate the association of SAFB1 with splicing we used exon array analysis and found SAFB1 knockdown mediated the statistically significant up- and downregulation of alternative exons. Further analysis using RNAmotifs to investigate the frequency of association between the motif pairs (AGA followed by AGA, GAA or AAG) and alternative spliced exons found there was a highly significant correlation with downregulated exons. Together, our data suggest SAFB1 will play an important physiological role in the central nervous system regulating synaptic function. We found that SAFB1 regulates dendritic spine density in hippocampal neurons and hence provide empirical evidence supporting this conclusion. Conclusions: iCLIP showed that SAFB1 has previously uncharacterised specific RNA binding properties that help coordinate the isoform-specific expression of coding and non-coding genes. These genes regulate splicing, axonal and synaptic function, and are associated with neuropsychiatric disease, suggesting that SAFB1 is an important regulator of key neuronal processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HnRNP", "ICLIP", "Long non-coding RNA", "MiRNA", "NCAM1", "Neuronal", "RNA", "SAFB1", "Splicing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative Splicing", "Antigens, CD56", "Down-Regulation", "Gene Expression", "Glycoproteins", "Humans", "Matrix Attachment Region Binding Proteins", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins", "Receptors, Estrogen", "RNA Splicing", "RNA, Untranslated", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951786426", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36840245900": {"Name": "Rivers C.", "AuthorID": "36840245900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University Walk, University of Bristol, Regenerative Medicine Laboratories, School of Clinical Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Medical Sciences Building"}, "57021651500": {"Name": "Idris J.", "AuthorID": "57021651500", "AffiliationID": "60031886", "AffiliationName": "University of Kuala Lumpur, Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology"}, "56679029300": {"Name": "Scott H.", "AuthorID": "56679029300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University Walk, University of Bristol, Regenerative Medicine Laboratories, School of Clinical Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Medical Sciences Building"}, "56906054500": {"Name": "Gaunt J.", "AuthorID": "56906054500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University Walk, University of Bristol, Regenerative Medicine Laboratories, School of Clinical Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Medical Sciences Building"}, "57210739454": {"Name": "Norman M.", "AuthorID": "57210739454", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University Walk, University of Bristol, Regenerative Medicine Laboratories, School of Clinical Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Medical Sciences Building"}, "7004494549": {"Name": "Uney J.", "AuthorID": "7004494549", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University Walk, University of Bristol, Regenerative Medicine Laboratories, School of Clinical Sciences, Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Medical Sciences Building"}, "7403368323": {"Name": "Campbell C.", "AuthorID": "7403368323", "AffiliationID": "60031886", "AffiliationName": "University of Kuala Lumpur, Institute of Medical Sciences and Technology"}, "14042232700": {"Name": "Rogers M.", "AuthorID": "14042232700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Department of Engineering and Mathematics"}, "8523814900": {"Name": "Lee Y.", "AuthorID": "8523814900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, MRC Centre for Neurodegeneration Research, King's College London"}, "6602100709": {"Name": "Phylactou L.", "AuthorID": "6602100709", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science"}, "6506958162": {"Name": "Curk T.", "AuthorID": "6506958162", "AffiliationID": "60071321", "AffiliationName": "The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics"}, "57204150692": {"Name": "Ule J.", "AuthorID": "57204150692", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Department of Molecular Neuroscience"}}}
