Objective measurement allows a robust examination of genetic and environmental influences on physical activity. Objective: To systematically review the evidence on the extent of genetic and environmental influence on children's objectively-measured activity levels from twin studies. Data sources and search terms: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Health and Psychosocial Instruments and all Ovid Databases. Search terms: \"accelerometer\" OR \"actometer\" OR \"motion sensor\" OR \"heart rate monitor\" OR \"physical activity energy expenditure\" AND \"twin\". Limited to Human, English language and children (0-18. years). Results: Seven sets of analyses were included in the review. Six analyses examined children's daily-life activity and found that the shared environment had a strong influence on activity levels (weighted mean 60%), with a smaller contribution from genetic factors (weighted mean 21%). Two analyses examined short-term, self-directed activity in a standard environment and found a smaller shared environment effect (weighted mean 25%) and a larger genetic estimate (weighted mean 45%). Conclusions: Although genetic influences may be expressed when children have brief opportunities for autonomous activity, activity levels in daily-life are predominantly explained by environmental factors. Future research should aim to identify key environmental drivers of childhood activity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activity", "Child", "Environment", "Genetic", "Twin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934979431", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56660238600": {"Name": "Fisher A.", "AuthorID": "56660238600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603929009": {"Name": "van Jaarsveld C.", "AuthorID": "6603929009", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003435566": {"Name": "Sawyer A.", "AuthorID": "7003435566", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
