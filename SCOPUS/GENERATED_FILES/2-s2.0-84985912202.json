It explains how the film both inhabits yet contests the discourses of the modern nation state underpinning those celebrations, in particular through its representation of conflict between the state and indigenous groups. Its representation draws on images proposed by an earlier work, Sarmiento\u2019s utopian tract of 1850, Argir\u00f3polis, images including the river and the island which in Martel\u2019s film undergo a resignification, which overturns Sarmiento\u2019s understanding of relationships between geography, capital, nation and ethnicity. Political and cultural debates of particular relevance to indigenous communities, such as access to land, as well as the way the indigenous are represented in state discourses, surface obliquely in this short film, which both represents diegetically the circulation and relay of rumours of indigenous resistance, as well as suggesting these formally through a soundtrack suffused with murmurs and barely audible sounds. The unsubtitled words of indigenous actors, as well as the authorities\u2019 attempts at investigation of indigenous political activity through staging encounters of (failed) interpretation, and the subversive mimicry by indigenous activists of hegemonic ideas of national foundation are themselves muted, rumoured suggestions of a resistance which always lies just outside this short film\u2019s visual grasp.", "AuthorKeywords": ["indigenous people", "language", "Nation", "Sarmiento", "water"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985912202", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"57213252224": {"Name": "Martin D.", "AuthorID": "57213252224", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}}}
