Retinal thickness maps from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) inform treatment decisions in other retinal conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic maculopathy. In this report, we demonstrate their value in providing quantitative monitoring of a patient with punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC). Retinal thickness maps referenced against a baseline scan reliably detected focal areas of increased macular volume in active PIC lesions during symptomatic episodes, highlighting these as \u2018hot spots\u2019 that could be quantified, providing an objective basis for treatment decisions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Macular grid", "Punctate inner choroidopathy", "Retinal thickness map", "SD-OCT", "White dot syndromes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961257745", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"16053052400": {"Name": "Madhusudhan S.", "AuthorID": "16053052400", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54880010400": {"Name": "Denniston A.K.", "AuthorID": "54880010400", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Inflammation Research, Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
