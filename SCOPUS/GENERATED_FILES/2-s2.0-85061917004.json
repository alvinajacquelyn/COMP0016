Part of this assessment comprises an investigation of relationships among palaeodemographic data, evidence for vegetation change and some consideration of rapid climate change events. The erosion data include recent or hitherto unpublished work from the authors. Where possible, we consider summed probabilities of 14C dates as well as the first published synthesis of all known optically stimulated luminescence dated sequences. The results suggest that while there were some periods when erosion took place contemporaneously across a number of regions, possibly induced by climate changes, more often than not, we see a complex and heterogeneous interplay of demographic and environmental changes that result in a mixed pattern of erosional activity across the Mediterranean.", "AuthorKeywords": ["demography", "erosion", "geoarchaeology", "Holocene", "human impact", "Mediterranean"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061917004", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"35756830000": {"Name": "Walsh K.", "AuthorID": "35756830000", "AffiliationID": "60102127", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Advanced Study (IM\u00e9RA), Aix-Marseille University"}, "56208401300": {"Name": "Berger J.F.", "AuthorID": "56208401300", "AffiliationID": "60108306, 60008134, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR 5600, EVS/IRG, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon"}, "56820614500": {"Name": "Roberts C.N.", "AuthorID": "56820614500", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Plymouth"}, "36138237700": {"Name": "Woodbridge J.", "AuthorID": "36138237700", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Plymouth"}, "8049973600": {"Name": "Vanniere B.", "AuthorID": "8049973600", "AffiliationID": "60031276, 60159358", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Chrono-Environnement, Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9"}, "22953432300": {"Name": "Ghilardi M.", "AuthorID": "22953432300", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60010578, 60028993, 60008134, 60112203, 60012012", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR 7330, Aix Marseille University, IRD, Coll\u00e8ge de France, INRA, CEREGE"}, "35551036400": {"Name": "Brown A.G.", "AuthorID": "35551036400", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment Science, University of Southampton"}, "56326302800": {"Name": "Lespez L.", "AuthorID": "56326302800", "AffiliationID": "60025066, 60112301", "AffiliationName": "LGP-CNRS UMR 8591, Department of Geography, University of Paris East-Cr\u00e9teil"}, "8907494800": {"Name": "Estrany J.", "AuthorID": "8907494800", "AffiliationID": "60009780", "AffiliationName": "Mediterranean Ecogeomorphological and Hydrological Connectivity Research Team and Institute of Agro-Environmental and Water Economy Research (INAGEA), University of the Balearic Islands"}, "56815074100": {"Name": "Glais A.", "AuthorID": "56815074100", "AffiliationID": "60032215, 60105608", "AffiliationName": "LETG-Caen-CNRS-UMR 6554, University of Caen Normandy"}, "56012510800": {"Name": "Palmisano A.", "AuthorID": "56012510800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London (UCL)"}, "36342166200": {"Name": "Finn\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "36342166200", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Ancient History, Uppsala University"}, "6603775264": {"Name": "Verstraeten G.", "AuthorID": "6603775264", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geography and Tourism, Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, KU Leuven"}}}
