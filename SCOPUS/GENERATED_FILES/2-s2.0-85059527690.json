Balmer.All over the world, civil legal problems are ubiquitous. But while all groups in every society that has been studied experience civil justice problems, these problems and their consequences do not fall equally. Socially disadvantaged people report more problems, more serious problems, and more negative consequences from them. The lack of legal capability-the lack of the capacity to understand and act on justice problems-plays a key role in creating these inequalities. A growing evidence base should support and enable global, national, and other policy-makers to achieve stated policy goals and enable people to respond effectively to the myriad legal problems that can threaten their aspirations and well-being.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059527690", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"6603460657": {"Name": "Pleasence P.", "AuthorID": "6603460657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602210843": {"Name": "Balmer N.", "AuthorID": "6602210843", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
