Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an archetypical ciliopathy caused by defective ciliary trafficking and consequent function. Insights gained from BBS mouse models are applicable to other syndromic and nonsyndromic retinal diseases. This progressive characterization of the visual phenotype in three BBS mouse models sets a baseline for testing therapeutic interventions. METHODS. Longitudinal acquisition of electroretinograms, optical coherence tomography scans, and visual acuity using the optomotor reflex in Bbs6/Mkks, Bbs8/Ttc8, and Bbs5 knockout mice. Gene and protein expression analysis in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS. Complete loss of BBS5, BBS6, or BBS8 leads to different rates of retinal degeneration and visual function over time. BBS8-deficient mice showed the fastest rate of degeneration, and BBS8 seems to be required for cone photoreceptors to reach functional maturity. In contrast, the loss of BBS5 (a further BBSome component) showed very little degeneration. Loss of BBS8 versus BBS5 resulted in different physiologic responses both in vivo and in vitro. BBS6-deficient mice show a slower rate of degeneration with both rod and cone function reducing at a similar rate. CONCLUSIONS. The mouse models analyzed show distinct and diverging courses of degeneration upon loss of BBS5, BBS6, or BBS8, which can be used as a benchmark to test therapeutic interventions. Close consideration of the different phenotypes reveal subtle but important differences relating to their function. Because we also see differences in terms of phenotype depending on the type of visual assessment used, our data highlight the importance of using a combinatorial approach for assessment of visual function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bardet-Biedl syndrome", "BBSome", "Mouse mutants", "Primary cilia", "Retinal disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Bardet-Biedl Syndrome", "Blotting, Western", "Carrier Proteins", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electroretinography", "Genotyping Techniques", "Group II Chaperonins", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Mutant Strains", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Phenotype", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Retina", "Retinal Degeneration", "Signal Transduction", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vision, Ocular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063658878", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55252063000": {"Name": "Kretschmer V.", "AuthorID": "55252063000", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Cilia Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Physiology, Johannes Gutenberg University"}, "55544966100": {"Name": "Patnaik S.R.", "AuthorID": "55544966100", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Cilia Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Physiology, Johannes Gutenberg University"}, "8745897800": {"Name": "May-Simera H.L.", "AuthorID": "8745897800", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Cilia Cell Biology, Institute of Molecular Physiology, Johannes Gutenberg University"}, "16242100900": {"Name": "Kretschmer F.", "AuthorID": "16242100900", "AffiliationID": "60030881", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computing Facility, Max Planck Institute for Brain Research"}, "57208050349": {"Name": "Chawda M.M.", "AuthorID": "57208050349", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7801667994": {"Name": "Hernandez-Hernandez V.", "AuthorID": "7801667994", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, College of Health and Life Sciences, Brunel University London"}}}
