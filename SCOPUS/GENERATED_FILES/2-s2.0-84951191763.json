However, the model organisms cell biologists generally use include only a tiny fraction of the true diversity of eukaryotic cellular forms. The divergent cellular processes observed in these more distant lineages are still largely unknown in the general scientific community. Despite the relative obscurity of these organisms, comparative studies of them across eukaryotic diversity have had profound implications for our understanding of fundamental cell biology in all species and have revealed the evolution and origins of previously observed cellular processes. In this Perspective, we will discuss the complexity of cell biology found across the eukaryotic tree, and three specific examples of where studies of divergent cell biology have altered our understanding of key functional aspects of mitochondria, plastids, and membrane trafficking.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Evolution", "Cell Biology", "Eukaryotic Cells", "Genetic Variation", "Mitochondria", "Phylogeny", "Plastids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951191763", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57014414100": {"Name": "Richardson E.", "AuthorID": "57014414100", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta"}, "57015245200": {"Name": "Zerr K.", "AuthorID": "57015245200", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta"}, "56490454700": {"Name": "Dacks J.", "AuthorID": "56490454700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta"}, "26535313800": {"Name": "Tsaousis A.", "AuthorID": "26535313800", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Evolutionary Parasitology, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "36961004700": {"Name": "Dorrell R.", "AuthorID": "36961004700", "AffiliationID": "60000179", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, Ecole Normale Supeieure"}}}
