Subclinical subtle cardiac structural remodelling is often present before symptoms arise. Understanding and early detection of these subtle changes is crucial for diagnosis and prevention. Additionally, personalized computational modelling requires knowledge on the multiscale structure of the whole heart and vessels. Methods and results We developed a rapid acquisition together with visualization and quantification methods of the integrated microstructure of whole in-vitro rodents hearts using synchrotron based X-ray phase-contrast tomography. These images are formed not only by X-ray absorption by the tissue but also by wave propagation phenomena, enhancing structural information, thus allowing to raise tissue contrast to an unprecedented level. We used a (ex-vivo) normal rat heart and fetal rabbit hearts suffering intrauterine growth restriction as a model of subclinical cardiac remodelling to illustrate the strengths and potential of the technique. For comparison, histology and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging was performed. Conclusions We have developed a novel, high resolution, image acquisition, and quantification approach to study a whole in-vitro heart at myofibre resolution, providing integrated 3D structural information at microscopic level without any need of tissue slicing and processing. This superior imaging approach opens up new possibilities for a systems approach towards analysing cardiac structure and function, providing rapid acquisition of quantitative microstructure of the heart in a near native state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coronary vasculature", "myocardial remodelling", "myofibre structure", "synchrotron phase-contrast CT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cardiovascular System", "Computer Simulation", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Models, Animal", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Rabbits", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Synchrotrons", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028997074", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"54389026500": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Tendero A.", "AuthorID": "54389026500", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315", "AffiliationName": "Fetal I+D Fetal Medicine Research Center, Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), University of Barcelona"}, "6506478886": {"Name": "Cardenes R.", "AuthorID": "6506478886", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "PhySense, DTIC, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "8693394500": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz-Moreno E.", "AuthorID": "8693394500", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315", "AffiliationName": "Fetal I+D Fetal Medicine Research Center, Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), University of Barcelona"}, "7005090944": {"Name": "Gratacos E.", "AuthorID": "7005090944", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315", "AffiliationName": "Fetal I+D Fetal Medicine Research Center, Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), University of Barcelona"}, "8923628700": {"Name": "Crispi F.", "AuthorID": "8923628700", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315", "AffiliationName": "Fetal I+D Fetal Medicine Research Center, Neonatal Medicine (Hospital Clinic and Hospital Sant Joan de Deu), University of Barcelona"}, "55853348100": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "55853348100", "AffiliationID": "113682245", "AffiliationName": "CellNetworks"}, "6603296130": {"Name": "Butakoff C.", "AuthorID": "6603296130", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "PhySense, DTIC, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "57004700400": {"Name": "Paun B.", "AuthorID": "57004700400", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "PhySense, DTIC, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "54388912000": {"Name": "Garcia-Ca\u00f1adilla P.", "AuthorID": "54388912000", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "PhySense, DTIC, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "7005275311": {"Name": "Bijnens B.", "AuthorID": "7005275311", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA"}, "55652389200": {"Name": "Balicevic V.", "AuthorID": "55652389200", "AffiliationID": "60159855, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb"}, "35547763500": {"Name": "Loncaric S.", "AuthorID": "35547763500", "AffiliationID": "60159855, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb"}, "52463234100": {"Name": "Bonnin A.", "AuthorID": "52463234100", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Paul Scherrer Institut"}}}
