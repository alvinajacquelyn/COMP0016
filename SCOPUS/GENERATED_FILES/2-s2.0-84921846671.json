All rights reserved.Background: Partner notification is the process of providing support for, informing and treating sexual partners of individuals who have been diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is traditionally undertaken by specialist sexual health services, and may involve informing a partner on a patient\u2019s behalf, with consent. With an increasing proportion of STIs diagnosed in general practice and other community settings, there is a growing need to understand the best way to provide partner notification for people diagnosed with a STI in this setting using a web-based referral system.Objective: We aimed to compare three different approaches to partner notification for people diagnosed with chlamydia within general practice.Design: Cluster randomised controlled trial. Setting: General practices in England and, within these, patients tested for and diagnosed with genital chlamydia or other bacterial STIs in that setting using a web-based referral system. Interventions: Three different approaches to partner notification: patient referral alone, or the additional offer of either provider referral or contract referral.m Main outcome measures: (1) Number of main partners per index patient treated for chlamydia and/or gonorrhoea/non-specific urethritis/pelvic inflammatory disease; and (2) proportion of index patients testing negative for the relevant STI at 3 months.Results: As testing rates for chlamydia were far lower than expected, we were unable to scale up the trial, which was concluded at pilot stage. We are not able to answer the original research question. We present the results of the work undertaken to improve recruitment to similar studies requiring opportunistic recruitment of young people in general practice. We were unable to standardise provider and contract referral separately; however, we also present results of qualitative work aimed at optimizing these interventions.Conclusions: External recruitment may be required to facilitate the recruitment of young people to research in general practice, especially in sensitive areas, because of specific barriers experienced by general practice staff. Costs need to be taken into account together with feasibility considerations. Partner notification interventions for bacterial STIs may not be clearly separable into the three categories of patient, provider and contract referral. Future research is needed to operationalise the approaches of provider and contract partner notification if future trials are to provide generalisable information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chlamydia Infections", "Cluster Analysis", "Contact Tracing", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Lymphogranuloma Venereum", "Male", "Patient Compliance", "Pilot Projects", "Primary Health Care", "Referral and Consultation", "Risk Assessment", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexual Partners", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921846671", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"57203069305": {"Name": "Cassell J.A.", "AuthorID": "57203069305", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "8419298800": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.", "AuthorID": "8419298800", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "55849888600": {"Name": "Lanza S.", "AuthorID": "55849888600", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "8560546300": {"Name": "Smith H.", "AuthorID": "8560546300", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "57199034121": {"Name": "Smith H.", "AuthorID": "57199034121", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "7005460414": {"Name": "Dodds J.", "AuthorID": "7005460414", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL, Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework"}, "6602151058": {"Name": "Rait G.", "AuthorID": "6602151058", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, General Practice Research Framework"}, "57206301412": {"Name": "Richens J.", "AuthorID": "57206301412", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL, Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework"}, "7003490365": {"Name": "Copas A.", "AuthorID": "7003490365", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL, Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework"}, "57203175207": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "57203175207", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL, Medical Research Council General Practice Research Framework"}, "57205874518": {"Name": "Estcourt C.", "AuthorID": "57205874518", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "BICMS, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary College, University of London"}, "52864996700": {"Name": "Symonds M.", "AuthorID": "52864996700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "BICMS, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary College, University of London"}, "55606369800": {"Name": "Roberts T.", "AuthorID": "55606369800", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, School of Health and Population Science, University of Birmingham"}, "9278821200": {"Name": "Mistry H.", "AuthorID": "9278821200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, School of Health and Population Science, University of Birmingham"}, "56497091300": {"Name": "Rossello-Roig M.", "AuthorID": "56497091300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, School of Health and Population Science, University of Birmingham"}, "8677587200": {"Name": "White P.", "AuthorID": "8677587200", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Modelling and Economics Unit, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "57207600992": {"Name": "Lowndes C.", "AuthorID": "57207600992", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "STI Section, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}}}
