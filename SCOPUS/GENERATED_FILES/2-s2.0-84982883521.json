This overheating will seriously affect people's comfort and even health, especially for elderly people. Phase change materials (PCMs) have been considered as a useful passive method, which absorb excessive heat when the room is hot and release the stored heat when the room is cool. This research has adopted a simulation method in DesignBuilder to evaluate the effectiveness of using PCMs to reduce the overheating issues in UK residential applications and has analyzed potential factors that will influence the effectiveness of overheating. The factors include environment-related (location of the building, global warming/climate change) and construction-related (location of the PCM, insulation, heavyweight/lightweight construction). This research provides useful evidence about using PCMs in UK residential applications and the results are helpful for architects and engineers to decide when and where to use PCMs in buildings to maintain a low carbon lifestyle.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Overheating", "Phase change material (PCM)", "Residential buildings", "Thermal storage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Elderly people", "Influential factors", "Low-carbon lifestyles", "Overheating", "Passive methods", "Residential application", "Residential building", "Thermal storage"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982883521", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190754925": {"Name": "Auzeby M.", "AuthorID": "57190754925", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment"}, "55504215000": {"Name": "Wei S.", "AuthorID": "55504215000", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment"}, "7005827176": {"Name": "Underwood C.", "AuthorID": "7005827176", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment"}, "57190759644": {"Name": "Tindall J.", "AuthorID": "57190759644", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment"}, "57215375495": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "57215375495", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "College of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Beijing University of Technology"}, "55258419000": {"Name": "Ling H.", "AuthorID": "55258419000", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "College of Architecture and Civil Engineering, Beijing University of Technology"}, "6602107780": {"Name": "Buswell R.", "AuthorID": "6602107780", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University"}}}
