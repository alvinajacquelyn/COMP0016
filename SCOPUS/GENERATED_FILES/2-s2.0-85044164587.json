Thus, we examined T cell priming with drugs associated with HLA risk alleles and control compounds in 14 HLA-typed donors. Nitroso sulfamethoxazole and piperacillin activated T cells from all donors, whereas responses to carbamazepine and oxypurinol were only seen in donors expressing HLA-B15:02 and HLA-B\u221758:01, respectively. Weak flucloxacillin-specific T cell responses were detected in donors expressing HLA-B\u221757:01 and HLA-B\u221758:01. These data show that the priming of T cells with certain drugs is skewed toward donors expressing specific HLA alleles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Infective Agents", "Anticonvulsants", "Carbamazepine", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "HLA Antigens", "HLA-B Antigens", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Nitroso Compounds", "Oxypurinol", "Piperacillin", "Sulfamethoxazole", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044164587", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"]], "AuthorData": {"56508945300": {"Name": "Usui T.", "AuthorID": "56508945300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "7103404706": {"Name": "Faulkner L.", "AuthorID": "7103404706", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "55568523244": {"Name": "Farrell J.", "AuthorID": "55568523244", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "7102564665": {"Name": "French N.S.", "AuthorID": "7102564665", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "6508330042": {"Name": "Alfirevic A.", "AuthorID": "6508330042", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "7006669713": {"Name": "Pirmohamed M.", "AuthorID": "7006669713", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "35478124100": {"Name": "Park B.K.", "AuthorID": "35478124100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}, "6603779088": {"Name": "Naisbitt D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603779088", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Sherrington Building"}}}
