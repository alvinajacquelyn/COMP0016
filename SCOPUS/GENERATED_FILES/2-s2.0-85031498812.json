Only short-term hemodynamic and echocardiographic results of Dual RV are available. We aimed to assess the long-term results of Dual RV and its impact on survival. Methods: Multicenter retrospective assessment of all CRT implants during a 12-year period. Patients with failed CS lead implantation, treated with Dual RV, were followed and assessed for the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality and/or heart transplant. A control group was obtained from contemporary patients using propensity matching for all available baseline variables. Results: Ninety-three patients were implanted with Dual RV devices and compared with 93 matched controls. During a median of 1,273 days (interquartile range 557\u20132,218), intention-to-treat analysis showed that all-cause mortality and/or heart transplant was higher in the Dual RV group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12\u20132.47, P = 0.012). As-treated analysis yielded similar results (HR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.31\u20132.96, P = 0.001). Cardiac device-related infections occurred seven times more frequently in the Dual RV site group (HR = 7.60, 95% CI 1.51\u201338.33, P = 0.014). Among Dual RV nonresponders, four had their apical leads switched off, five required an epicardial LV lead insertion, a transseptal LV lead was implanted in two, and in nine patients, after reviewing the CS venogram, a new CS lead insertion was successfully attempted. Conclusion: Dual RV pacing is associated with worse clinical outcomes and higher complication rates than conventional CRT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac resynchronization therapy", "electrical dyssynchrony", "endocardial pacing", "heart failure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Male", "Pacemaker, Artificial", "Propensity Score", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031498812", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"15769947600": {"Name": "Providencia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57196055412": {"Name": "Colicchia M.", "AuthorID": "57196055412", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7004204877": {"Name": "Segal O.R.", "AuthorID": "7004204877", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6701816368": {"Name": "Sporton S.", "AuthorID": "6701816368", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "10244786500": {"Name": "Dhinoja M.", "AuthorID": "10244786500", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "35279299600": {"Name": "Ahsan S.", "AuthorID": "35279299600", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "14043109300": {"Name": "Ezzat V.", "AuthorID": "14043109300", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56313471000": {"Name": "Rowland E.", "AuthorID": "56313471000", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7202196645": {"Name": "Lowe M.", "AuthorID": "7202196645", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "16063029200": {"Name": "Chow A.W.", "AuthorID": "16063029200", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "37025430000": {"Name": "Barra S.", "AuthorID": "37025430000", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23033889600": {"Name": "Duehmke R.", "AuthorID": "23033889600", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35518549600": {"Name": "Agarwal S.", "AuthorID": "35518549600", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210709690": {"Name": "Papageorgiou N.", "AuthorID": "57210709690", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College of London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57188664278": {"Name": "Ioannou A.", "AuthorID": "57188664278", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College of London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "15924111200": {"Name": "Rogers D.", "AuthorID": "15924111200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College of London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57196056137": {"Name": "Wongwarawipat T.", "AuthorID": "57196056137", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College of London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57195283803": {"Name": "Falconer D.", "AuthorID": "57195283803", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College of London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57190984518": {"Name": "Babu G.", "AuthorID": "57190984518", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "The Heart Hospital, University College of London Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
