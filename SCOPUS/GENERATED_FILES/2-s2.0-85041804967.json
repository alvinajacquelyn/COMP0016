The objectives are as follows: To evaluate the effects of locally delivered antimicrobials (with sustained or controlled drug delivery) in the treatment of chronic periodontitis in adults. Primary objectives: To test: the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effect between mechanical debridement alone and mechanical debridement with adjunctive local delivery antimicrobial; the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effect between mechanical debridement with adjunctive placebo and mechanical debridement with adjunctive local delivery antimicrobial; the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effect between mechanical debridement alone and local delivery antimicrobial alone, the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effect between mechanical debridement with a particular adjunctive local delivery antimicrobial and mechanical debridement with comparative adjunctive local delivery antimicrobial (head to head comparison); the null hypothesis of no difference in treatment effect between a particular local delivery antimicrobial alone (monotherapy) and a comparative local delivery antimicrobial alone (monotherapy). Secondary objective: To report on: post-operative adverse effects associated with local delivery antimicrobials; quality of life changes; patient experience of the treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041804967", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"19637686000": {"Name": "Suvan J.", "AuthorID": "19637686000", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Periodontology Unit, Division of Restorative Dental Services"}, "35848742100": {"Name": "Needleman I.", "AuthorID": "35848742100", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Unit of Periodontology and International Centre for Evidence-Based Oral Healthcare"}, "7004350944": {"Name": "Moles D.R.", "AuthorID": "7004350944", "AffiliationID": "60115301", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Dental School, Oral Health Services Research"}, "35602248900": {"Name": "Tonetti M.", "AuthorID": "35602248900", "AffiliationID": "100881907", "AffiliationName": "European Research Group on Periodontology (ERGOPERIO)"}}}
