The phased array is designed for a 30\u00b0 field of view to give full coverage of an avalanche track. A fully populated, uniform linear array design is achieved using overlapping sub-arrays of 2A spacing, and with 16 elements, the beamwidth of the array is 1.6\u00b0. The phased array is arranged on a three layer PCB that is split into four panels due to its large physical width (1.95 m). The array is mounted on plastic pillars screwed to an aluminium base in a watertight radome to provide mechanical strength. Radio absorbent material between the PCB's and the aluminium base prevent back lobe reflections. A continuous ground across the PCB panels is maintained using grounded copper sheet bridges. Initial laboratory measurements of the phased array show that its performance agrees well with predictions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C-band", "FMCW radar", "PCB design", "phased array radar", "radar imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorbent materials", "C-bands", "FMCW radar", "Laboratory measurements", "PCB design", "Phased array radars", "Phased array receiver", "Uniform linear arrays"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971201796", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"36185201600": {"Name": "Ash M.", "AuthorID": "36185201600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56030050300": {"Name": "Tanha M.", "AuthorID": "56030050300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35087329300": {"Name": "Brennan P.", "AuthorID": "35087329300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57189458749": {"Name": "Kohlert A.", "AuthorID": "57189458749", "AffiliationID": "60018789", "AffiliationName": "WSL Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research"}, "8693486500": {"Name": "McElwaine J.", "AuthorID": "8693486500", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Durham University"}, "6603617648": {"Name": "Keylock C.", "AuthorID": "6603617648", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Structural Engineering, University of Sheffield"}}}
