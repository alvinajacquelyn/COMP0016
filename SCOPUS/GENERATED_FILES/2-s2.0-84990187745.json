Immunology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Vitamin D is widely reported to inhibit innate immune signalling and dendritic cell (DC) maturation as a potential immunoregulatory mechanism. It is not known whether vitamin D has global or gene-specific effects on transcriptional responses downstream of innate immune stimulation, or whether vitamin D inhibition of innate immune signalling is common to different cells. We confirmed vitamin D inhibition of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling in monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This was associated with global but modest attenuation of LPS-induced transcriptional changes at genome-wide level. Surprisingly, vitamin D did not inhibit innate immune NF-\u03baB activation in monocyte-derived macrophages. Consistent with our findings in MDDC, ex vivo vitamin D treatment of primary peripheral blood myeloid DC also led to significant inhibition of LPS-inducible NF-\u03baB activation. Unexpectedly, in the same samples, vitamin D enhanced activation of both NF-\u03baB and MAPK signalling in primary peripheral blood monocytes. In a cross-sectional clinical cohort, we found no relationship between peripheral blood vitamin D levels and LPS-inducible activation of NF-\u03baB and MAPK pathways in monocytes of myeloid DC. Remarkably, however, in vivo supplementation of people with vitamin D deficiency in this clinical cohort also enhanced LPS-inducible MAPK signalling in peripheral blood monocytes. Therefore, we report that vitamin D differentially modulates the molecular response to innate immune stimulation in monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. These results are of importance in the design of studies on vitamin D supplementation in infectious and immunological diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dendritic cells", "macrophages", "mitogen-activated protein kinase", "monocytes", "nuclear factor-\u03baB", "vitamin D"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cells, Cultured", "Cohort Studies", "Dendritic Cells", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Macrophages", "Middle Aged", "Monocytes", "NF-kappa B", "Organ Specificity", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Signal Transduction", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D Deficiency", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990187745", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56193539600": {"Name": "Kundu R.", "AuthorID": "56193539600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunobiology, King's College London"}, "56542637700": {"Name": "Haas C.", "AuthorID": "56542637700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "36464615900": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "36464615900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "35509213600": {"Name": "Chain B.", "AuthorID": "35509213600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57195363908": {"Name": "Noursadeghi M.", "AuthorID": "57195363908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "26768409400": {"Name": "Theodoraki A.", "AuthorID": "26768409400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "36185394100": {"Name": "Khoo B.", "AuthorID": "36185394100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Endocrinology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "27567808900": {"Name": "Kriston-Vizi J.", "AuthorID": "27567808900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
