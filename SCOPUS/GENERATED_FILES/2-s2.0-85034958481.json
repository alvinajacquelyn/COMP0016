Springer International Publishing AG.Models of sequence evolution are used ubiquitously in biology from phylogenetic reconstruction to the analysis of adaptation, coevolution, and convergence. The structure of the model used affects these analyses, and it is therefore preferable to use good models. The field of molecular evolution is currently undergoing an important transformation due to large increases in the ability to collect and analyze massive amounts of data. Here, we briefly review the history of molecular evolution and then discuss how evidence of epistasis and convergent molecular evolution helps overturn traditional models of protein evolution. We conclude by discussing desired features in a simple mechanistic model of protein evolution that is more compatible with patterns observed in real and simulated protein evolution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034958481", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"7202569082": {"Name": "Pollock D.", "AuthorID": "7202569082", "AffiliationID": "60028421", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine"}, "56675483100": {"Name": "Pollard S.", "AuthorID": "56675483100", "AffiliationID": "60028421", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine"}, "57193315387": {"Name": "Shortt J.", "AuthorID": "57193315387", "AffiliationID": "60028421", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine"}, "7403005698": {"Name": "Goldstein R.", "AuthorID": "7403005698", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
