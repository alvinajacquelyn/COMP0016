The catalytically inactive adaptor Dnmt3L is essential to ensuring this occurs correctly, but the mechanism by which it functions is unclear. Using gene targeting to engineer a single-amino-acid mutation, we show that the Dnmt3L histone H3 binding domain (ADD) is necessary for spermatogenesis. Genome-wide single-base-resolution DNA methylome analysis of mutant germ cells revealed overall reductions in CG methylation at repetitive sequences and non-promoter CpG islands. Strikingly, we also observe an even more severe loss of non-CG methylation, suggesting an unexpected role for the ADD in this process. These epigenetic deficiencies were coupled with defects in spermatogonia, with mutant cells displaying marked changes in gene expression and reactivation of retrotransposons. Our results demonstrate that the Dnmt3L ADD is necessary for Dnmt3L function and full reproductive fitness.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923103623", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57200370748": {"Name": "Vlachogiannis G.", "AuthorID": "57200370748", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetic Signaling Group, Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "26435497500": {"Name": "Tuna S.", "AuthorID": "26435497500", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetic Signaling Group, Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "13807825800": {"Name": "Stathopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "13807825800", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetic Signaling Group, Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "6507134090": {"Name": "Viiri K.", "AuthorID": "6507134090", "AffiliationID": "60014090, 60008760", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Research Centre, University of Tampere Medical School and Tampere University Hospital"}, "7004044168": {"Name": "Jenner R.G.", "AuthorID": "7004044168", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetic Signaling Group, Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "12239907600": {"Name": "Ooi S.K.T.", "AuthorID": "12239907600", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetic Signaling Group, Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "55290340400": {"Name": "Niederhuth C.E.", "AuthorID": "55290340400", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, University of Georgia"}, "11839657900": {"Name": "Schmitz R.J.", "AuthorID": "11839657900", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, University of Georgia"}, "7007029491": {"Name": "de Rooij D.G.", "AuthorID": "7007029491", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Center for Reproductive Medicine, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}}}
