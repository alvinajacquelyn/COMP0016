Tinnitus is the perception of a phantom sound. The aim of this study was to compare current intensity (center anode 1 mA and 2 mA), duration (10 minutes and 20 minutes), and location (left temporoparietal area [LTA] and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC]) using 4 \u00d7 1 high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) for tinnitus reduction. Methods. Twenty-seven participants with chronic tinnitus (>2 years) and mean age of 53.5 years underwent 2 sessions of HD-tDCS of the LTA and DLPFC in a randomized order with a 1 week gap between site of stimulation. During each session, a combination of 4 different settings were used in increasing dose (1 mA, 10 minutes; 1 mA, 20 minutes; 2 mA, 10 minutes; and 2 mA, 20 minutes). The impact of different settings on tinnitus loudness and annoyance was documented. Results. Twenty-one participants (77.78%) reported a minimum of 1 point reduction on tinnitus loudness or annoyance scales. There were significant changes in loudness and annoyance for duration of stimulation, F(1, 26) = 10.08, P <.005, and current intensity, F(1, 26) = 14.24, P =.001. There was no interaction between the location, intensity, and duration of stimulation. Higher intensity (2 mA) and longer duration (20 minutes) of stimulation were more effective. Conclusions. A current intensity of 2 mA for 20-minute duration was the most effective setting used for tinnitus relief. The stimulation of the LTA and DLPFC were equally effective for suppressing tinnitus loudness and annoyance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation", "neuromodulation", "noninvasive brain stimulation", "tinnitus", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Parietal Lobe", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Temporal Lobe", "Tinnitus", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964320750", "SubjectAreas": [["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56087344000": {"Name": "Shekhawat G.S.", "AuthorID": "56087344000", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Section of Audiology, University of Auckland, Tamaki Innovation Campus"}, "35727070700": {"Name": "Sundram F.", "AuthorID": "35727070700", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Section of Audiology, University of Auckland, Tamaki Innovation Campus"}, "6602248230": {"Name": "Stinear C.M.", "AuthorID": "6602248230", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Section of Audiology, University of Auckland, Tamaki Innovation Campus"}, "55741979000": {"Name": "Welch D.", "AuthorID": "55741979000", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Section of Audiology, University of Auckland, Tamaki Innovation Campus"}, "6506808384": {"Name": "Searchfield G.D.", "AuthorID": "6506808384", "AffiliationID": "113004218", "AffiliationName": "Tinnitus Research Initiative"}, "6602932724": {"Name": "Bikson M.", "AuthorID": "6602932724", "AffiliationID": "60028458", "AffiliationName": "City College of New York"}, "55515426600": {"Name": "Truong D.", "AuthorID": "55515426600", "AffiliationID": "60028458", "AffiliationName": "City College of New York"}, "7006928697": {"Name": "De Ridder D.", "AuthorID": "7006928697", "AffiliationID": "113004218", "AffiliationName": "Tinnitus Research Initiative"}}}
