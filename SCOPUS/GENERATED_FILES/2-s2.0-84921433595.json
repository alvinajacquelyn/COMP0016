Although diffusion microscopic MRI (\u03bcMRI) has been used to phenotype embryos, widespread routine use is limited by extended scanning times, and there is no established experimental procedure ensuring optimal data acquisition. Methods: We developed two protocols for designing experimental procedures for diffusion \u03bcMRI of mouse embryos, which take into account the effect of embryo preparation and pulse sequence parameters on resulting data. We applied our protocols to an investigation of the splotch mouse model as an example implementation. Results: The protocols provide DTI data in 24 min per direction at 75 \u03bcm isotropic using a three-dimensional fast spin-echo sequence, enabling preliminary imaging in 3 h (6 directions plus one unweighted measurement), or detailed imaging in 9 h (42 directions plus six unweighted measurements). Application to the splotch model enabled assessment of spinal cord pathology. Conclusion: We present guidelines for designing diffusion \u03bcMRI experiments, which may be adapted for different studies and research facilities. As they are suitable for routine use and may be readily implemented, we hope they will be adopted by the phenotyping community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion microscopic magnetic resonance imaging", "Mouse embryo", "Phenotyping", "Spina bifida", "Splotch mouse model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental procedure", "Fast spin echos", "Mouse embryos", "Mouse models", "Phenotyping", "Pulse sequence", "Research facilities", "Spina bifida", "Animals", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Image Enhancement", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microscopy", "Paired Box Transcription Factors", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Specimen Handling", "Spinal Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921433595", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"36681378200": {"Name": "Norris F.C.", "AuthorID": "36681378200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and EXperimental Biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "36088022100": {"Name": "Siow B.M.", "AuthorID": "36088022100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Departments of Medical Physics and Bioengineering and Computer Science, University College London"}, "34970921700": {"Name": "Cleary J.O.", "AuthorID": "34970921700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, University of Melbourne"}, "35220662900": {"Name": "Wells J.A.", "AuthorID": "35220662900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Departments of Medical Physics and Bioengineering and Computer Science, University College London"}, "7005125494": {"Name": "Ordidge R.J.", "AuthorID": "7005125494", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, University of Melbourne"}, "16303182000": {"Name": "De Castro S.C.P.", "AuthorID": "16303182000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neural Development Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35587452100": {"Name": "Greene N.D.E.", "AuthorID": "35587452100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neural Development Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neural Development Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006489319": {"Name": "Scambler P.J.", "AuthorID": "7006489319", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Medicine Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
