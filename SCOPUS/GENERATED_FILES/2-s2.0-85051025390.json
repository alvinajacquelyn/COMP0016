Our aim is to address the effects of cell load and hit probability on the successful content delivery (SCD) and present the minimum required base station density for avoiding the access overload in an arbitrary small cell and backhaul overload in an arbitrary macrocell. The achievable rate of massive MIMO backhaul without any downlink channel estimation is derived to calculate the backhaul time, and the latency is also evaluated in such networks. The analytical results confirm that hit probability needs to be appropriately selected in order to achieve SCD. The interplay between cache size and SCD is explicitly quantified. It is theoretically demonstrated that when non-cached contents are requested, the average delay of the non-cached content delivery could be comparable to the cached content delivery with the help of massive MIMO-aided self-backhaul, if the average access rate of cached content delivery is lower than that of self-backhauled content delivery. Simulation results are presented to validate our analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dense small cell", "Edge caching", "massive MIMO", "self-backhaul"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular network", "Delays", "Edge caching", "Massive MIMO", "MIMO communication", "Resource management", "Self-backhauls", "Small cells", "Wireless communications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051025390", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56072896600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56072896600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8587025300": {"Name": "Lambotharan S.", "AuthorID": "8587025300", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "6603561059": {"Name": "Nallanathan A.", "AuthorID": "6603561059", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6602911293": {"Name": "Elkashlan M.", "AuthorID": "6602911293", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
