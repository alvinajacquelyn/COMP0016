Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: To investigate the prevalence and location of pelvic adhesions in women with a history of Cesarean section and to identify risk factors for their formation and symptoms associated with their presence. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of women in whom one or more Cesarean sections had been performed > 12 months previously and who attended for a gynecological ultrasound examination. In all women, both transvaginal and transabdominal scans were performed in order to identify the presence of pelvic adhesions. Medical and surgical history was recorded and a structured questionnaire was used to enquire about any history of pelvic pain and urinary symptoms. Results: A total of 308 women were recruited into the study. On ultrasound examination, 139 (45.1% (95% CI, 39.7-50.7%)) women showed evidence of adhesions within the pelvis. Adhesions in the vesicouterine pouch were the most common and were found in a total of 79 (25.6% (95% CI, 20.7-30.5%)) women. In women with a history of no surgery other than Cesarean section(s) ( n = 220), an increasing number of Cesarean sections (odds ratio (OR) 3.4 (95% CI, 2.1-5.5)) and a postoperative wound infection (OR 11.7 (95% CI, 3.5-39.5)) increased the likelihood of adhesions developing in the anterior pelvic compartment. There was a significant association between the presence of anterior compartment adhesions and chronic pelvic pain. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified anterior abdominal wall adhesions (OR 2.4 (95% CI, 1.0-5.9)) and any adhesions present on ultrasound scan (OR 2.6 (95% CI, 1.2-5.7)) as independent predictors of chronic pelvic pain. Conclusions: Pelvic adhesions are present in more than a third of women with a history of Cesarean section and they are associated with chronic pelvic pain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cesarean section", "Surgical adhesions", "Ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cesarean Section", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Pelvic Pain", "Pelvis", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tissue Adhesions", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922739747", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"36955507200": {"Name": "Moro F.", "AuthorID": "36955507200", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Hospital"}, "17135521400": {"Name": "Mavrelos D.", "AuthorID": "17135521400", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Hospital"}, "24173569700": {"Name": "Pateman K.", "AuthorID": "24173569700", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Hospital"}, "16401708500": {"Name": "Holland T.", "AuthorID": "16401708500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Hospital"}, "35589803400": {"Name": "Hoo W.L.", "AuthorID": "35589803400", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Hospital"}, "7004871743": {"Name": "Jurkovic D.", "AuthorID": "7004871743", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Hospital"}}}
