Methods: EEGs of 70 babies (35 seizure, 35 non-seizure) were annotated for seizures by experts as the gold standard. The SDA was tested on the EEGs at a range of sensitivity settings. Annotations from the expert and SDA were compared using event and epoch based metrics. The effect of seizure duration on SDA performance was also analysed. Results: Between sensitivity settings of 0.5 and 0.3, the algorithm achieved seizure detection rates of 52.6-75.0%, with false detection (FD) rates of 0.04-0.36 FD/h for event based analysis, which was deemed to be acceptable in a clinical environment. Time based comparison of expert and SDA annotations using Cohen's Kappa Index revealed a best performing SDA threshold of 0.4 (Kappa 0.630). The SDA showed improved detection performance with longer seizures. Conclusion: The SDA achieved promising performance and warrants further testing in a live clinical evaluation. Significance: The SDA has the potential to improve seizure detection and provide a robust tool for comparing treatment regimens.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated seizure detection", "Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy", "Neonatal EEG", "Neonatal neurology", "Neonatal seizures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930466524", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"15924307900": {"Name": "Stevenson N.", "AuthorID": "15924307900", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "26663546300": {"Name": "Low E.", "AuthorID": "26663546300", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "36832339300": {"Name": "Marnane W.", "AuthorID": "36832339300", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "12143283200": {"Name": "Temko A.", "AuthorID": "12143283200", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "7003406304": {"Name": "Lightbody G.", "AuthorID": "7003406304", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "54906442400": {"Name": "Mathieson S.", "AuthorID": "54906442400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Research Department of Neonatology, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102446358": {"Name": "Rennie J.", "AuthorID": "7102446358", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Research Department of Neonatology, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
