Methods: Data from 11,391 men and women (aged \u226550) were obtained from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing cohort. Assessments were carried out at baseline (2002\u20132003) and at biannual follow-ups (2004\u20132013). Results: Older adults who carried out moderate to vigorous activity at least once per week had a 34%\u201350% lower risk for cognitive decline and dementia over an 8\u201310 year follow-up period. From pre- to post-dementia diagnosis, those who decreased PA levels had a larger decrease in immediate recall scores, compared to those who maintained or increased PA levels (analyses were adjusted for changes in physical function). Conclusion: PA was associated with cognitive outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. Reduction in PA after diagnosis was associated with accelerated cognitive decline and maintaining PA may reduce symptom progression in dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "cognitive functioning", "epidemiology (dementia)", "other dementias", "physical activity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Dementia", "Disease Progression", "England", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proportional Hazards Models"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031509007", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56079447900": {"Name": "Soni M.", "AuthorID": "56079447900", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "6506350604": {"Name": "Bandelow S.", "AuthorID": "6506350604", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "55391833400": {"Name": "Hogervorst E.", "AuthorID": "55391833400", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "15848781400": {"Name": "Rafnsson S.", "AuthorID": "15848781400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7801394833": {"Name": "d'Orsi E.", "AuthorID": "7801394833", "AffiliationID": "60017609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Federal University of Santa Catarina"}, "8234756400": {"Name": "Xavier A.", "AuthorID": "8234756400", "AffiliationID": "60015580", "AffiliationName": "Health Academic Unit, Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina"}}}
