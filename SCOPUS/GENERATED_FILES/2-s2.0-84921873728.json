The effect of thalassemia carriage on hepcidin is also unknown, but it could be relevant for iron supplementation programs aimed at combating anemia. In 62 of 69 Sri Lankan patients with HbE \u03b2-thalassemia with moderate or severe phenotype, hepcidin was suppressed, and overall hepcidin inversely correlated with iron accumulation. On segregating by phenotype, there were no differences in hepcidin, erythropoiesis, or hemoglobin between severe ormoderate disease, but multiple linear regression showed that erythropoiesis inversely correlated with hepcidin only in severe phenotypes. In moderate disease, no independent predictors of hepcidin were identifiable; nevertheless, the low hepcidin levels indicate a significant risk for iron overload. In a population survey of SriLankan schoolchildren, \u03b2-thalassemia (but not HbE) trait was associated with increased erythropoiesis and mildly suppressed hepcidin, suggesting an enhanced propensity to accumulate iron. In summary, the influence of erythropoiesis on hepcidin suppression associates with phenotypic disease variation and pathogenesis in HbE \u03b2-thalassemia and indicates that the epidemiology of \u03b2-thalassemia trait requires consideration when planning public health iron interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "beta-Globins", "beta-Thalassemia", "Blood Transfusion", "Carrier State", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Erythropoiesis", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genotype", "Hemoglobin E", "Hepcidins", "Humans", "Iron", "Iron Overload", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Severity of Illness Index", "Sri Lanka"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921873728", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56496057700": {"Name": "Jones E.", "AuthorID": "56496057700", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "24169377800": {"Name": "Pasricha S.R.", "AuthorID": "24169377800", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7402131475": {"Name": "Fisher C.A.", "AuthorID": "7402131475", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "56496668500": {"Name": "Wray K.", "AuthorID": "56496668500", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "11939257500": {"Name": "Armitage A.E.", "AuthorID": "11939257500", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "56911177400": {"Name": "Weatherall D.J.", "AuthorID": "56911177400", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "6602256149": {"Name": "Drakesmith H.", "AuthorID": "6602256149", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7402802597": {"Name": "Allen A.", "AuthorID": "7402802597", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Swansea University"}, "35453535900": {"Name": "Evans P.", "AuthorID": "35453535900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London Cancer Institute, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "7403427269": {"Name": "Porter J.B.", "AuthorID": "7403427269", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London Cancer Institute, Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "6506805282": {"Name": "Premawardhena A.", "AuthorID": "6506805282", "AffiliationID": "60071104", "AffiliationName": "University of Kelaniya"}, "37000610100": {"Name": "Bandara D.", "AuthorID": "37000610100", "AffiliationID": "100658753", "AffiliationName": "National Thalassaemia Centre, District Hospital"}, "56359052900": {"Name": "Perera A.", "AuthorID": "56359052900", "AffiliationID": "100658753", "AffiliationName": "National Thalassaemia Centre, District Hospital"}, "37027655000": {"Name": "Webster C.", "AuthorID": "37027655000", "AffiliationID": "60024356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital"}, "56332828900": {"Name": "Sturges P.", "AuthorID": "56332828900", "AffiliationID": "60024356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Immunology, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital"}, "7007064788": {"Name": "Olivieri N.F.", "AuthorID": "7007064788", "AffiliationID": "60014468, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "8092760500": {"Name": "St Pierre T.", "AuthorID": "8092760500", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Western Australia"}}}
