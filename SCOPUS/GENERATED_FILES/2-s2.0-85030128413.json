However, the process of mechanotransduction whereby a mechanical stimulus gives rise to a neuronal response is not well understood. In this paper we present an investigation of the biomechanics of touch using the model organism C. elegans. By developing a custom micromanipulation and force sensing system around a high resolution optical microscope, we measured the spatial deformation of the organism's cuticle and force response to controlled uniaxial indentations. We combined these experimental results with anatomical data to create a multilayer computational biomechanical model of the organism and accurately derive its material properties such as the elastic modulus and poisson's ratio. We demonstrate the utility of this model by combining it with previously published electrophysiological data to provide quantitative insights into different biomechanical states for mechanotransduction, including the first estimate of the sensitivity of an individual mechanoreceptor to an applied stimulus (parameterised as strain energy density). We also interpret empirical behavioural data to estimate the minimum number of mechanoreceptors which must be activated to elicit a behavioural response.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Computer Simulation", "Mechanoreceptors", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Models, Biological", "Touch"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030128413", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6506149530": {"Name": "Elmi M.", "AuthorID": "6506149530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL TouchLab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "13607280000": {"Name": "Pawar V.", "AuthorID": "13607280000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL TouchLab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57169472300": {"Name": "Shaw M.", "AuthorID": "57169472300", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "57195922166": {"Name": "Wong D.", "AuthorID": "57195922166", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL TouchLab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57195916230": {"Name": "Zhan H.", "AuthorID": "57195916230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL TouchLab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7203044605": {"Name": "Srinivasan M.", "AuthorID": "7203044605", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "MIT TouchLab, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Research Laboratory of Electronics"}}}
