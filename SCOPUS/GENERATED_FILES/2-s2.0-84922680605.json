In addition to proteins, CSF also contains a large number of endogenous peptides whose potential as disease biomarkers largely remains to be explored. We have developed a novel workflow in which multiplex isobaric labeling is used for simultaneous quantification of endogenous CSF peptides and proteins by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. After the labeling of CSF samples, endogenous peptides are separated from proteins by ultrafiltration. The proteins retained on the filters are trypsinized, and the tryptic peptides are collected separately. We evaluated this technique in a comparative pilot study of CSF peptide and protein profiles in eight patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and eight nondemented controls. We identified several differences between the AD and control group among endogenous peptides derived from proteins known to be associated with AD, including neurosecretory protein VGF (ratios AD/controls 0.45-0.81), integral membrane protein 2B (ratios AD/controls 0.72-0.84), and metallothionein-3 (ratios AD/controls 0.51-0.61). Analysis of tryptic peptides identified several proteins that were altered in the AD group, some of which have previously been reported as changed in AD, for example, VGF (ratio AD/controls 0.70).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "biomarker discovery", "cerebrospinal fluid", "clinical proteomics", "isobaric labeling", "neurodegenerative disease", "peptidomics", "Proteomics", "quantification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptides", "Proteomics", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922680605", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"36990173700": {"Name": "H\u00f6ltt\u00e4 M.", "AuthorID": "36990173700", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg"}, "16238630700": {"Name": "Holm\u00e9n-Larsson J.", "AuthorID": "16238630700", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg"}, "6602847091": {"Name": "R\u00fcetschi U.", "AuthorID": "6602847091", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg"}, "6603847526": {"Name": "Gobom J.", "AuthorID": "6603847526", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg"}, "7003614157": {"Name": "Minthon L.", "AuthorID": "7003614157", "AffiliationID": "60118587, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences Malm\u00f6, Lund University"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60118587, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences Malm\u00f6, Lund University"}, "57188777253": {"Name": "Pike I.", "AuthorID": "57188777253", "AffiliationID": "105158425", "AffiliationName": "Proteome Sciences PLC"}, "57202976639": {"Name": "Ward M.", "AuthorID": "57202976639", "AffiliationID": "105158425", "AffiliationName": "Proteome Sciences PLC"}, "36916507900": {"Name": "Kuhn K.", "AuthorID": "36916507900", "AffiliationID": "101624361", "AffiliationName": "Proteome Science RandD GmbH and Co KG"}}}
