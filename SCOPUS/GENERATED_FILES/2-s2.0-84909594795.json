We report on serum protein levels prior to clinical presentation of pancreatic cancer. Serum ICAM-1 and TIMP-1 were measured by ELISA in two case-control sets: 1) samples from patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (n= 40), chronic pancreatitis (n= 20), benign jaundice due to gall stones (n= 20) and healthy subjects (n= 20); 2) a preclinical set from the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening biobank of samples collected from 27 post-menopausal women 0-12. months prior to diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and controls matched for date of donation and centre. Levels of ICAM-1 and TIMP-1 were significantly elevated in set 1 in PDAC patients with jaundice compared to PDAC patients without jaundice and both proteins were elevated in patients with jaundice due to gall stones. Neither protein was elevated in samples taken 0-12. months prior to PDAC diagnosis compared to non-cancer control samples. In conclusion, evaluation in pre-diagnosis samples discounts ICAM-1 and TIMP-1 as biomarkers for earlier diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Failure to account for obstructive jaundice may have contributed to the previous promise of these candidate biomarkers. Biological significance: Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed when at an advanced stage which greatly limits therapeutic options. Biomarkers that could facilitate earlier diagnosis are urgently sought.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ICAM-1", "Pancreatic cancer", "Serum biomarker", "TIMP-1", "UKCTOCS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal", "Case-Control Studies", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Humans", "Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84909594795", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"57206326568": {"Name": "Jenkinson C.", "AuthorID": "57206326568", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "24175836600": {"Name": "Elliott V.", "AuthorID": "24175836600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Liverpool Pancreas Biomedical Research Unit, University of Liverpool"}, "42261425800": {"Name": "Cox T.F.", "AuthorID": "42261425800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Liverpool Pancreas Biomedical Research Unit, University of Liverpool"}, "6603621553": {"Name": "Greenhalf W.", "AuthorID": "6603621553", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Liverpool Pancreas Biomedical Research Unit, University of Liverpool"}, "55607108700": {"Name": "Sutton R.", "AuthorID": "55607108700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "7102231480": {"Name": "Neoptolemos J.P.", "AuthorID": "7102231480", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "17833870500": {"Name": "Costello E.", "AuthorID": "17833870500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "55318584600": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "55318584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "22633490000": {"Name": "Apostolidou S.", "AuthorID": "22633490000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56410823500": {"Name": "Fourkala O.E.", "AuthorID": "56410823500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "16205135000": {"Name": "Gentry-Maharaj A.", "AuthorID": "16205135000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "34975076100": {"Name": "Jacobs I.", "AuthorID": "34975076100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, 1.018 Core Technology Facility, University of Manchester"}, "7004011904": {"Name": "Timms J.F.", "AuthorID": "7004011904", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.P.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, 1.018 Core Technology Facility, University of Manchester"}}}
