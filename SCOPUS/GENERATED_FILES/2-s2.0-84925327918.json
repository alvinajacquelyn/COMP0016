First, the users' ergodic rates are derived for the case with a finite number of antennas, and then, the rate gain is analyzed when the transmit power of the senders and the relay is sufficiently large. We show that the ergodic rates increase with the number of antennas at the relay, i.e., N, but decrease with the number of user pairs, i.e., K, both logarithmically. The energy efficiency for the network is also investigated when the number of antennas grows to infinity. It is further revealed that the ergodic sum-rate can be maintained while the users' transmit power is scaled down by a factor of 1/N or the relay power by a factor of 2K/N. This indicates that users obtain an energy efficiency gain of N, but the relay has an energy efficiency gain of N divided by the number of users, i.e., 2K.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy Efficiency", "Ergodic achievable rate", "Massive MIMO", "Maximum ratio combining", "maximum ratio transmission", "Two-way relaying"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amplification factors", "Ergodics", "Maximum ratio combining", "Maximum ratio transmission", "Multiple pairs", "Relay stations", "Two-way relay networks", "Two-way relaying"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925327918", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "7403872378": {"Name": "Gao X.", "AuthorID": "7403872378", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "37002786200": {"Name": "Liang X.", "AuthorID": "37002786200", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "35220981400": {"Name": "Zhu Q.", "AuthorID": "35220981400", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
