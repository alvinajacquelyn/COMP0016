We consider the three dimensional space domain with periodic boundary conditions. Our solutions satisfy the weak formulation of the mass and momentum conservation equations and also a generalization of the BD-entropy identity called: \u03ba-entropy. This new entropy involves a mixture parameter \u03ba\u2208(0, 1) between the two velocities u and u+2\u2207;\u03d5(\u03c1{variant}) (the latter was introduced by the first two authors in Bresch and Desjardins (2005) [5]), where u is the velocity field and \u03d5 is a function of the density \u03c1{variant} defined by \u03d5<sup>'</sup>(s)=\u03bc<sup>'</sup>(s)/s. As a byproduct of the existence proof, we show that two-velocity hydrodynamics (in the spirit of S.C. Shugrin, 1994) is a possible formulation of a model of barotropic compressible flow with degenerate viscosities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Augmented system", "Compressible Navier-Stokes", "Hypocoercivity", "Two-velocity hydrodynamics", "\u03ba-Entropy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941192044", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004084203": {"Name": "Bresch D.", "AuthorID": "7004084203", "AffiliationID": "60019513", "AffiliationName": "LAMA UMR5127 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Savoie Mont-Blanc"}, "57197034646": {"Name": "Desjardins B.", "AuthorID": "57197034646", "AffiliationID": "60180341", "AffiliationName": "Fondation Math\u00e9matique Jacques Hadamard and CMLA ENS Cachan"}, "36717202900": {"Name": "Zatorska E.", "AuthorID": "36717202900", "AffiliationID": "60110679, 60013756", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, University of Warsaw"}}}
