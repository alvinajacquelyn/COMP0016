Despite the theoretical developments in this area, the ability to handle uncertain parameters on the left-hand side remains limited and as a result, hybrid, or approximate solution strategies have been proposed in the literature. In this work, a new algorithm is introduced for the exact solution of multi-parametric linear programming problems with simultaneous variations in the objective function's coefficients, the right-hand side and the left-hand side of the constraints. The proposed methodology is based on the analytical solution of the system of equations derived from the first order Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions for general linear programming problems using symbolic manipulation. Emphasis is given on the ability of the proposed methodology to handle efficiently the LHS uncertainty by computing exactly the corresponding nonconvex critical regions while numerical studies underline further the advantages of the proposed methodology, when compared to existing algorithms. \u00a9 2017 The Authors AIChE Journal published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 63: 3871\u20133895, 2017.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Groebner bases", "left hand side uncertainty", "linear programming", "multi-parametric programming", "symbolic manipulation", "uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Groebner basis", "Left hand side uncertainty", "Multi-parametric programming", "Symbolic manipulation", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018754988", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57189662256": {"Name": "Charitopoulos V.M.", "AuthorID": "57189662256", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Process Systems Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Process Systems Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "7005602392": {"Name": "Dua V.", "AuthorID": "7005602392", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, Centre for Process Systems Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}}}
