Particular emphasis is placed on MRI and Ultrasound as they do not impart ionising radiation. Both modalities have reported high sensitivity for disease detection, activity assessment and evaluation of extra-luminal complications, and have positive effects on clinical decision making. International Guidelines now recommend MRI and Ultrasound in the routine management of Crohn's disease patients. This article reviews the current evidence base supporting both modalities with an emphasis on the key clinical questions. We describe current protocols, basic imaging findings and highlight areas in need of further research. Level of Evidence: 5. Technical Efficacy: Stage 4. J. MAGN. RESON.
