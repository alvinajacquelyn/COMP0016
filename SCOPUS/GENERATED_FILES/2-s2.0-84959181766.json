All rights reserved.We report an advanced chemical vapour deposition approach which yields not previously observed carbon-based foam-like films completely filled with a single phase of \u03b1-Fe. These films are found in the region of the chemical vapour deposition reactor where the temperature is relatively low (650-770 \u00b0C) and exhibit a high saturation magnetization as high as 200-220 emu/g at room temperature when small concentrations of Cl-radicals are added to the pyrolysing CVD system by mixing 0.15 ml of dichlorobenzene to ferrocene. Instead when the only ferrocene is used a lower saturation magnetization of 140-145 emu/g is found due to an amorphous arrangement of the Fe-phase in some parts of the foam. Also we show that for much higher concentration of Cl radicals (0.65 ml of dichlorobenzene mixed to ferrocene) a dramatic decrease of the quantity of crystalline \u03b1-Fe is found together with the formation of amorphous Fe and FexOx phases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon-based", "Chemical vapour deposition", "Dichlorobenzenes", "Ferrocenes", "High magnetization", "High-saturation magnetization", "Single phase", "Small concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959181766", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55816684500": {"Name": "Boi F.", "AuthorID": "55816684500", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Sino-British Joint Materials Research Institute, Sichuan University"}, "56456916900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56456916900", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Sino-British Joint Materials Research Institute, Sichuan University"}, "55346011900": {"Name": "Lan M.", "AuthorID": "55346011900", "AffiliationID": "60016521, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Energy Density Physics, Technology of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University"}, "53165310300": {"Name": "Yu T.", "AuthorID": "53165310300", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Physical Science and Technology, Sichuan University"}, "36609251300": {"Name": "Xiang G.", "AuthorID": "36609251300", "AffiliationID": "60016521, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Energy Density Physics, Technology of Ministry of Education, Sichuan University"}, "56228660700": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "56228660700", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University"}, "56486342400": {"Name": "He Y.", "AuthorID": "56486342400", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University"}, "23098857300": {"Name": "Wen J.", "AuthorID": "23098857300", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University"}}}
