There is increasing evidence to implicate placental over-expression of tissue factor and PAR-1 in the pathophysiology of PE. Excessive activation of platelets, neutrophils and the complement system may also contribute to the placental pathology and maternal endothelial responsible for the symptoms of PE. Increased knowledge in this field may identify new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of PE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Haemostasis", "Platelets", "Preeclampsia", "Syncytiotrophoblast", "Tissue factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Antiphospholipid", "Blood Platelets", "Complement Activation", "Female", "Hemostasis", "Humans", "Neutrophils", "Placenta", "Platelet Activation", "Pre-Eclampsia", "Pregnancy", "Thromboplastin", "Trophoblasts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014469748", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7006359228": {"Name": "Gardiner C.", "AuthorID": "7006359228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College"}, "6602975147": {"Name": "Vatish M.", "AuthorID": "6602975147", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Oxford"}}}
