Both stressful life events (SLES) and neural correlates of learning [specifically, a key mediator of adaptive learning in the brain, namely the ventral striatal representation of prediction errors (PE)] have been shown to be associated with individual differences in fluid IQ. Here, we examine the interaction between adaptive learning signals (using a well-characterized probabilistic reversal learning task in combination with fMRI) and SLES on fluid IQ measures. We find that the correlation between ventral striatal BOLD PE and fluid IQ, which we have previously reported, is quantitatively modulated by the amount of reported SLES. Thus, after experiencing adversity, basic neuronal learning signatures appear to align more closely with a general measure of flexible learning (fluid IQ), a finding complementing studies on the effects of acute stress on learning. The results suggest that an understanding of the neurobiological correlates of trait variables like fluid IQ needs to take socioemotional influences such as chronic stress into account.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intelligence", "Prediction error signal", "Reinforcement learning", "Stress", "Ventral striatum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Reversal Learning", "Stress, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922230346", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55884238500": {"Name": "Friedel E.", "AuthorID": "55884238500", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "11140368800": {"Name": "Schlagenhauf F.", "AuthorID": "11140368800", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "35301843000": {"Name": "Beck A.", "AuthorID": "35301843000", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "56577545000": {"Name": "Rapp M.A.", "AuthorID": "56577545000", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Potsdam"}, "57201513357": {"Name": "Heinz A.", "AuthorID": "57201513357", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Cluster of Excellence NeuroCure, Charite-Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}, "14056255700": {"Name": "Huys Q.J.M.", "AuthorID": "14056255700", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University Hospital of Psychiatry"}}}
