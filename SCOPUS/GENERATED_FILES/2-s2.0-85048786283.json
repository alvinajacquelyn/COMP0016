The customers\u2019 perspectives considered include their perceptions of service punctuality, waiting times, and comfort of journeys. The optimization formulation is subject to constraints representing operational requirements and signaling systems. The optimization model is applied to the Brighton main line network in south-east England as a case study, and the results demonstrate how the proposed optimization framework can help government and train operators to derive more effective and equitable timetables with consideration of customer satisfaction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Operational requirements", "Optimization formulations", "Optimization framework", "Optimization modeling", "Signaling systems", "Train operator", "Train timetables", "Train timetabling"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048786283", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57202009764": {"Name": "Pavlides A.", "AuthorID": "57202009764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "36146863600": {"Name": "Chow A.", "AuthorID": "36146863600", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong"}}}
