Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: To assess whether short-term changes in income (IC) in adulthood were associated with self-rated oral health (SROH) and chewing difficulties (CD). Methods: Secondary analysis of a longitudinal study in Florian\u00f3polis, Southern Brazil (EpiFloripa); a total of 1720 adults participated in 2009 and 1223 in 2012. Logistic regression analysed the variation of SROH and CD according to short-term changes in income (IC) groups (\u2018high income-stable\u2019, \u2018increased income\u2019, \u2018decreased income\u2019 and \u2018low income-stable\u2019) and adjusted for covariates (age, sex, marital status, skin colour, self-reported number of teeth and education). Results: After adjusting for covariates, participants in the \u2018decreased income\u2019 were more likely to have poor SROH and CD than those at the \u2018high income-stable\u2019 group (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.58; OR: 2.76, 95% CI: 1.61, 4.74, respectively). Significant differences were also found between the \u2018low income-stable\u2019 and \u2018high income-stable\u2019 groups, but these differences were explained when adjusted for potential confounders. There were no significant differences in SROH and CD between the \u2018increased income\u2019 and the \u2018high income-stable\u2019 groups. Conclusions: Overall, SROH and CD were adversely influenced by negative changes in income during adulthood in a short period of 3 years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chewing difficulties", "cohort study", "income", "self-rated oral health", "trajectories"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Brazil", "Female", "Humans", "Income", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mastication", "Middle Aged", "Oral Health", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991628926", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57191570140": {"Name": "Di Bernardi E.R.", "AuthorID": "57191570140", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102814490": {"Name": "Sheiham A.", "AuthorID": "7102814490", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6602807493": {"Name": "Peres K.G.", "AuthorID": "6602807493", "AffiliationID": "60082338, 60009512", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health, School of Dentistry, University of Adelaide"}, "55930551500": {"Name": "Peres M.A.", "AuthorID": "55930551500", "AffiliationID": "60082338, 60009512", "AffiliationName": "Australian Research Centre for Population Oral Health, School of Dentistry, University of Adelaide"}}}
