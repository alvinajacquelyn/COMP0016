Methods: Pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate liquids were prepared in accordance with the guidelines given to patients from marketed 50 mg PLP dietary capsules and tablets. The PLP content and its stability were evaluated under conditions resembling the clinical setting using reverse phase HPLC and mass spectrometry. Key findings: Pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate content in most of the extemporaneously prepared liquids from dietary supplements was found to be different from the expected amount (~16\u201360 mg). Most of these PLP extemporaneous liquids were stable at room temperature (protected from light) after 24 h but unstable after 4 h when exposed to light. A key photodegradation product of PLP in water was confirmed as 4-pyridoxic acid 5\u2032-phosphate (PAP). Conclusion: Pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate tablets from Solgar\u00ae were found to be the most reliable product for the preparation of extemporaneous PLP liquids. This work highlighted the difference between the marketed PLP dietary supplements quality and the importance of proper storage of aqueous PLP. There is a need to develop pharmaceutical forms of PLP that ensure dose accuracy and avoid potentially unsafe impurities with the aim of enhancing safety and compliance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dietary supplements", "epilepsy", "pyridox(am)ine 5\u2032-phosphate oxidase deficiency", "pyridoxal-5-phosphate", "stability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dietary Supplements", "Dosage Forms", "Drug Stability", "Drug Storage", "Epilepsy", "Pharmaceutical Solutions", "Photolysis", "Pyridoxal Phosphate", "Quality Control", "Vitamin B Complex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013407929", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"55501686800": {"Name": "Mohamed-Ahmed A.H.A.", "AuthorID": "55501686800", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57193379441": {"Name": "Albuera M.", "AuthorID": "57193379441", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57193383685": {"Name": "Chen T.", "AuthorID": "57193383685", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57192312138": {"Name": "Wilson M.P.", "AuthorID": "57192312138", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57202556029": {"Name": "Mills P.B.", "AuthorID": "57202556029", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.T.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "24066333000": {"Name": "Footitt E.J.", "AuthorID": "24066333000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Medicine Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
