Method: Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) was obtained from seven children with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS; five males, two females; age at event 5y; standard deviation [SD] 2y 1mo), six children in a minimally conscious state (MCS; three males, three females; age at event 5y 10mo; SD 5y), and 10 healthy children as controls(two males, eight females; age at study 10y 10mo; SD 2y 10mo). Fractional anisotropy, mean, axial, and radial diffusivities were calculated for the corpus callosum, inferior, middle (MCP), and superior cerebellar peduncles (SCP). Results: DT-MRI parameters from corpus callosum and SCP differed between patients and controls. MCP abnormalities were detected in patients presenting non-traumatic composite aetiology (n=4) versus those suffering from pure anoxia (n=9). The supra-tentorial compartment was more damaged (i.e. decreased fractional anisotropy and increased diffusivities) than the infra-tentorial one. Correlations were found between DT-MRI abnormalities and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores. Interpretation: In paediatric UWS/MCS, the severity of clinical disability correlates with white matter tract abnormalities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Analysis of Variance", "Anisotropy", "Brain Injuries", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Severity of Illness Index", "Statistics as Topic", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006138297", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"23390220100": {"Name": "Molteni E.", "AuthorID": "23390220100", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Acquired Brain Injury Unit \u2013 Scientific Institute IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "6602611240": {"Name": "Strazzer S.", "AuthorID": "6602611240", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Acquired Brain Injury Unit \u2013 Scientific Institute IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "39060943000": {"Name": "Colombo K.", "AuthorID": "39060943000", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Acquired Brain Injury Unit \u2013 Scientific Institute IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "26632807900": {"Name": "Arrigoni F.", "AuthorID": "26632807900", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Acquired Brain Injury Unit \u2013 Scientific Institute IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "14023305500": {"Name": "Pastore V.", "AuthorID": "14023305500", "AffiliationID": "60083538", "AffiliationName": "Acquired Brain Injury Unit \u2013 Scientific Institute IRCCS Eugenio Medea"}, "34973365100": {"Name": "Rocca M.", "AuthorID": "34973365100", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "7005421345": {"Name": "Pagani E.", "AuthorID": "7005421345", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "56803485100": {"Name": "Boffa G.", "AuthorID": "56803485100", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "7202268530": {"Name": "Filippi M.", "AuthorID": "7202268530", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "24474249000": {"Name": "Copetti M.", "AuthorID": "24474249000", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Biostatistics, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital"}}}
