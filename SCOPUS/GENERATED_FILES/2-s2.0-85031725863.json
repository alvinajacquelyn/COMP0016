HCMV co-infection is nearly universal in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals and remains an important cofactor in HIV-1 disease progression even in the era of effective antiretroviral treatment. HCMV infection has been shown to have a broad and potent influence on the human immune system and has been linked with the discovery and characterization of adaptive natural killer (NK) cells. Distinct NK-cell subsets, predominately expressing the activating receptor NKG2C and the marker of terminal differentiation CD57, expand in response to HCMV. These NK-cell populations engaged in the long-lasting interaction with HCMV, in addition to characteristic but variable expression of surface receptors, exhibit reduced expression of signaling proteins and transcription factors expressed by canonical NK cells. Broad epigenetic modifications drive the emergence and persistence of HCMV-adapted NK cells that have distinct functional characteristics. NKG2C+ NK-cell expansions have been observed in HIV-1 infected patients and other acute and chronic viral infections being systematically associated with HCMV seropositivity. The latter is potentially an important confounding variable in studies focused on the cellular NK-cell receptor repertoire and functional capacity. Here, focusing on HIV-1 infection we review the evidence in favor of \"adaptive\" changes likely induced by HCMV co-infection in NK-cell subsets. We highlight a number of key questions and how insights into the adaptive behavior of NK cells will inform new strategies exploiting their unique properties in the fight against HIV-1.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive", "CD57", "Human cytomegalovirus", "Human immunodeficiency virus", "Natural killer cells", "NKG2C"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031725863", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"24171517900": {"Name": "Peppa D.", "AuthorID": "24171517900", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}}}
