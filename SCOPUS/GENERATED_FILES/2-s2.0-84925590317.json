In 2012, Single Hub and Access point for pediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) was launched with the aim of optimising and disseminating diagnostic and management regimens for children and young adults with rheumatic diseases. The objective was to establish recommendations for FMF focusing on provision of diagnostic tools for inexperienced clinicians particularly regarding interpretation of MEFV mutations. Evidencebased recommendations were developed using the European League against Rheumatism standard operating procedure. An expert committee of paediatric rheumatologists defined search terms for the systematic literature review. Two independent experts scored articles for validity and level of evidence. Recommendations derived from the literature were evaluated by an online survey and statements with less than 80% agreement were reformulated. Subsequently, all recommendations were discussed at a consensus meeting using the nominal group technique and were accepted if more than 80% agreement was reached. The literature search yielded 3386 articles, of which 25 were considered relevant and scored for validity and level of evidence. In total, 17 articles were scored valid and used to formulate the recommendations. Eight recommendations were accepted with 100% agreement after the consensus meeting. Topics covered were clinical versus genetic diagnosis of FMF, genotype-phenotype correlation, genotype-age at onset correlation, silent carriers and risk of amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis, and role of the specialist in FMF diagnosis. The SHARE initiative provides recommendations for diagnosing FMF aimed at facilitating improved and uniform care throughout Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Familial Mediterranean Fever", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925590317", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36004587700": {"Name": "Giancane G.", "AuthorID": "36004587700", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Immunology, UMC"}, "8050234100": {"Name": "Wulffraat N.", "AuthorID": "8050234100", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Immunology, UMC"}, "8600420500": {"Name": "Vastert S.J.", "AuthorID": "8600420500", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Immunology, UMC"}, "55645525500": {"Name": "Haar N.M.T.", "AuthorID": "55645525500", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Translational Immunology, UMC"}, "7102526124": {"Name": "Barron K.", "AuthorID": "7102526124", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "NIH"}, "6602227522": {"Name": "Hentgen V.", "AuthorID": "6602227522", "AffiliationID": "60020966", "AffiliationName": "Reference Centre for Autoinflammatory Disorders (CEREMAI) Centre Hospitalier de Versailles"}, "6602976539": {"Name": "Kallinich T.", "AuthorID": "6602976539", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charite University Medicine"}, "7003581103": {"Name": "Ozdogan H.", "AuthorID": "7003581103", "AffiliationID": "100451408", "AffiliationName": "Cerrahpasa Ic Hastaliklari Klinigi"}, "56369274100": {"Name": "Anton J.", "AuthorID": "56369274100", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "7004602186": {"Name": "Brogan P.", "AuthorID": "7004602186", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Inflammation and Rheumatology Section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7801512355": {"Name": "Cantarini L.", "AuthorID": "7801512355", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Policlinico Le Scotte, University of Siena"}, "7102043304": {"Name": "Frenkel J.", "AuthorID": "7102043304", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, UMC"}, "26024974100": {"Name": "Galeotti C.", "AuthorID": "26024974100", "AffiliationID": "60013430, 60106017", "AffiliationName": "Reference Centre for Autoinflammatory Disorders CEREMAI, Bic\u00eatre Hospital, University of Paris SUD"}, "7004161632": {"Name": "Gattorno M.", "AuthorID": "7004161632", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "UO Pediatria II, G.
