Branched derivatives of octanoic acid (OA), a medium chain fat provided in the diet have been suggested as potential new treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy, but the structural basis of this functionality has not been determined. Here we investigate structural variants of branched medium chain fatty acids as new seizure-control treatments. We initially employ a series of methyl-branched OA derivatives, and using the GABAA receptor antagonist pentylenetetrazol to induce seizure-like activity in rat hippocampal slices, we show a strong, branch-point-specific activity that improves upon the related epilepsy treatment valproic acid. Using low magnesium conditions to induce glutamate excitotoxicity in rat primary hippocampal neuronal cultures for the assessment of neuroprotection, we also show a structural dependence identical to that for seizure control, suggesting a related mechanism of action for these compounds in both seizure control and neuroprotection. In contrast, the effect of these compounds on histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition, associated with teratogenicity, shows no correlation with therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, small structural modifications of the starting compounds provide active compounds without HDAC inhibitory effects. Finally, using multiple in vivo seizure models, we identify potent lead candidates for the treatment of epilepsy. This study therefore identifies a novel family of fatty acids, related to the MCT ketogenic diet, that show promise as new treatments for epilepsy control and possibly other MCT ketogenic diet-responding conditions, such as Alzheimer disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anticonvulsants", "Caprylates", "Hippocampus", "Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors", "Histone Deacetylases", "Ketogenic Diet", "Magnesium", "Male", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Pentylenetetrazole", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Seizures", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919762194", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"36616203100": {"Name": "Chang P.", "AuthorID": "36616203100", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "56425793800": {"Name": "Zuckermann A.M.E.", "AuthorID": "56425793800", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "7102595384": {"Name": "McEvoy J.P.", "AuthorID": "7102595384", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "57203074071": {"Name": "Williams R.S.B.", "AuthorID": "57203074071", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Sciences, School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "56459824600": {"Name": "Close A.J.", "AuthorID": "56459824600", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "57035681300": {"Name": "Spencer J.", "AuthorID": "57035681300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "57198985220": {"Name": "Williams S.", "AuthorID": "57198985220", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "15767203000": {"Name": "Cano-Jaimez M.", "AuthorID": "15767203000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35243898700": {"Name": "Walker M.C.", "AuthorID": "35243898700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
