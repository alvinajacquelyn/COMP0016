Methods: Sequences of talk in which a therapist introduced a patient to alternative perspectives, were transcribed and analysed using the method of conversation analysis. Results: The analysis identifies one subtle way a patient is invited to consider an alternative perspective relating to their disease progression. Meaning expansion enquiries invite the patient to expand on the meaning of an utterance and in doing so, implicitly problematize the singularity of the patient's assumptions, without directly challenging them. The questions work as preliminary moves, providing the patient with the opportunity to expand on their assumptions. This enables the therapist to subsequently present an alternative perspective in a way that incorporates the patient's expanded perspective. Conclusion: The analysis reveals a skilful way in which therapists can cautiously and collaboratively introduce a patient to alternative perspectives concerning end-of-life, without invalidating the patient's perspective in this particularly delicate context. Practice Implications: Whilst mentalization is considered an important therapeutic process, the present study reveals precisely how this phenomenon can be enacted in therapy and within the particularly challenging context of end-of-life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conversation analysis", "End-of-Life", "Mentalization", "Mortality", "Palliative care", "Psychoanalytic", "Psychotherapy", "Qualitative Research", "Questions", "Supportive-expressive"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude to Death", "Communication", "Humans", "Mentalization", "Neoplasms", "Palliative Care", "Psychotherapy", "Qualitative Research", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Terminal Care", "Terminally Ill"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055520502", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55917035200": {"Name": "Shaw C.", "AuthorID": "55917035200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "8595206700": {"Name": "Lo C.", "AuthorID": "8595206700", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "12779098600": {"Name": "Hales S.", "AuthorID": "12779098600", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "7004277403": {"Name": "Rodin G.", "AuthorID": "7004277403", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Department of Supportive Care, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "10040678500": {"Name": "Lanceley A.", "AuthorID": "10040678500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56623083000": {"Name": "Chrysikou V.", "AuthorID": "56623083000", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust (CNWL)"}}}
