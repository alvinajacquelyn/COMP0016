One method uses a relatively low concentration of the cryoprotectant propane-diol plus sucrose and requires controlled rate cooling equipment to achieve a slow cooling rate. Such a method has also produced live births from cryopreserved human oocytes. The second method described employs a high concentration of the cryoprotectant dimethyl sulfoxide plus a low concentration of polyethylene glycol. This is a vitrifi cation method which involves ultrarapid cooling by plunging standard straws into liquid nitrogen vapor, hence avoiding the need for specialized equipment, but requires technical ability to manipulate the oocytes quickly in the highly concentrated cryoprotectant solutions. Murine oocytes vitrifi ed using this technique has resulted in live births.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cryopreservation", "Cryoprotective Agents", "Dimethyl Sulfoxide", "Female", "Humans", "Mice", "Oocytes", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Vitrification"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922041797", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"8622622100": {"Name": "Keros V.", "AuthorID": "8622622100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7102974662": {"Name": "Fuller B.", "AuthorID": "7102974662", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
