The experiments were modeled using Monte Carlo simulations that include tunnel ionization rates calculated for hydrogen and scaled by the Ps reduced mass. Our measurements exhibit a small disagreement with the calculated tunnel ionization rates. Despite this we show that the electric fields in which different Ps states are ionized are sufficiently separated to allow selective field-ionization methods to be used in typical experimental conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electric field ionization", "Experimental conditions", "Principal quantum numbers", "Pulsed electric field", "Reduced mass", "Selective field ionizations", "State selective", "Tunnel ionization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057208119", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56662772200": {"Name": "Alonso A.", "AuthorID": "56662772200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57205068737": {"Name": "Gurung L.", "AuthorID": "57205068737", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57204785764": {"Name": "Sukra B.", "AuthorID": "57204785764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "17434872000": {"Name": "Hogan S.", "AuthorID": "17434872000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "54790549500": {"Name": "Cassidy D.", "AuthorID": "54790549500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
