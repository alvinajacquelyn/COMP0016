Methods: ERPs were measured in 25 infants with mainly symptomatic WS (age range = 3-10 months) and 26 healthy term infants (age range = 3-9 months) using an auditory novelty oddball paradigm. The ERP recordings were made during wakefulness and repeated in stage II sleep. Results: The obligatory components (P150, N250, P350) and novelty response components (P300, Nc) were recordable during both sleep and wakefulness in patients and controls. All ERP latencies decreased with age in controls but not in the WS group (age x group interaction, F = 22.3, p < 0.0001). These ERP latency alterations were not affected by pharmacological treatment for WS. Interpretation: This study demonstrated a persistently altered ERP signature in patients with a recent history of infantile spasms. The prolongation of auditory obligatory and novelty ERPs in WS patients indicates a severe failure of temporal lobe maturation during infancy. It remains to be investigated whether this predicts long-term cognitive impairments characteristic for this epileptic encephalopathy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Case-Control Studies", "Contingent Negative Variation", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Reaction Time", "Spasms, Infantile", "Temporal Lobe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920933251", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56457677600": {"Name": "Werner K.", "AuthorID": "56457677600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Clinical Neurosciences Unit"}, "15026440500": {"Name": "Fosi T.", "AuthorID": "15026440500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Clinical Neurosciences Unit"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Vermont"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children National Health Service Trust"}, "7201529100": {"Name": "Boyd S.G.", "AuthorID": "7201529100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Clinical Neurosciences Unit"}, "7003274699": {"Name": "Baldeweg T.", "AuthorID": "7003274699", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neuroscience Programme, University College London Institute of Child Health"}}}
