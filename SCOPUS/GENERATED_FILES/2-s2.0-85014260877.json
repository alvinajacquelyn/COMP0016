The availability of low-cost and consumer grade tDCS devices has democratized access to such technology allowing us to explore its applicability to HCI. We review the relevant literature and identify potential avenues for exploration within the context of enhancing interactivity and use of tDCS in the context of HCI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HCI", "Neurostimulation", "TDCS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direct current", "Interactivity", "Low costs", "Neural stimulations", "Neurostimulation", "TDCS", "Transcranial", "Working memory"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014260877", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"56187061300": {"Name": "Wan B.", "AuthorID": "56187061300", "AffiliationID": "60025578", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, Xidian University"}, "55247108300": {"Name": "Vi C.", "AuthorID": "55247108300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, University of Sussex"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}, "57215517228": {"Name": "Plasencia D.M.", "AuthorID": "57215517228", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Interact Lab, University of Sussex"}}}
