Karger AG, Basel.Background: No candidate biomarkers based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been identified as prognostic factors in patients with major depression treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), yet. Method: Following different underlying hypotheses, we analysed baseline CSF levels of markers of neurodegeneration (tau proteins, \u03b2-amyloids and neurogranin), elements of the innate immune system (interleukin [IL]-6, neopterin, soluble CD14, soluble CD163, migration inhibitory factor and monocyte chemotactic protein 1), endocannabinoids, sphingolipids and Klotho before ECT in patients with depression (n = 12) to identify possible correlations with the clinical antidepressant response to ECT. Results: Correlation with the reduction of the depressive symptoms could be observed especially for markers of neurodegeneration and elements of the innate immune system. Differences for CSF levels of several markers were found between the groups of responders and non-responders at the trend level. Limitations: The sample size is small and the -distribution of responders and non-responders is uneven. Conclusions: It is this first study on CSF biomarkers for antidepressant efficacy of ECT warrants further research regarding the mechanism of ECT and personalized antidepressant therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Depression", "Electroconvulsive therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Electroconvulsive Therapy", "Endocannabinoids", "Female", "Glucuronidase", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Degeneration", "Sphingolipids", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052745561", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"16745389900": {"Name": "Kranaster L.", "AuthorID": "16745389900", "AffiliationID": "60016908, 60005285", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Heidelberg University"}, "56029788500": {"Name": "Aksay S.S.", "AuthorID": "56029788500", "AffiliationID": "60016908, 60005285", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Heidelberg University"}, "6602350236": {"Name": "Sartorius A.", "AuthorID": "6602350236", "AffiliationID": "60016908, 60005285", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, Heidelberg University"}, "17343783800": {"Name": "Hoyer C.", "AuthorID": "17343783800", "AffiliationID": "60001972", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Centre Mannheim"}, "55504136600": {"Name": "Bumb J.M.", "AuthorID": "55504136600", "AffiliationID": "60016908, 60005285", "AffiliationName": "Department of Addictive Behavior and Addiction Medicine, Central Institute of Mental Health, Heidelberg University"}, "24290494300": {"Name": "M\u00fcller N.", "AuthorID": "24290494300", "AffiliationID": "118641970", "AffiliationName": "Marion von Tessin Memory-Zentrum"}, "7003974799": {"Name": "Zill P.", "AuthorID": "7003974799", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Ludwig Maximilian University Munich"}, "7402723667": {"Name": "Schwarz M.J.", "AuthorID": "7402723667", "AffiliationID": "60000291", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital LMU Munich"}, "57193449971": {"Name": "Moll N.", "AuthorID": "57193449971", "AffiliationID": "60000291", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Laboratory Medicine, University Hospital LMU Munich"}, "55655045900": {"Name": "Lutz B.", "AuthorID": "55655045900", "AffiliationID": "60022135, 60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physiological Chemistry, University Medical Center Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz"}, "6506457322": {"Name": "Bindila L.", "AuthorID": "6506457322", "AffiliationID": "60022135, 60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physiological Chemistry, University Medical Center Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz"}, "8382301500": {"Name": "Zerr I.", "AuthorID": "8382301500", "AffiliationID": "60021110, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "15844268800": {"Name": "Schmitz M.", "AuthorID": "15844268800", "AffiliationID": "60021110, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, UCL"}, "7005877632": {"Name": "Haffner D.", "AuthorID": "7005877632", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Kidney, Liver and Metabolic Diseases, Hannover Medical School"}, "35740940600": {"Name": "Leifheit-Nestler M.", "AuthorID": "35740940600", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Kidney, Liver and Metabolic Diseases, Hannover Medical School"}, "36458908900": {"Name": "Ozbalci C.", "AuthorID": "36458908900", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Heidelberg University, Biochemistry Center"}, "7003823646": {"Name": "Janke C.", "AuthorID": "7003823646", "AffiliationID": "60001972", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, University Medical Centre Mannheim"}, "57197481921": {"Name": "Thiel M.", "AuthorID": "57197481921", "AffiliationID": "60001972", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, University Medical Centre Mannheim"}}}
