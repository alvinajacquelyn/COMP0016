Protecting this model of global governance in this context has been referred to by the US and EU as \u2018essential\u2019 to the future of the Internet. Bringing together actors from the private sector, the public sector and also civil society, multi-stakeholder Internet governance is not only regarded by many as the best way to organise around this particular issue, it is also held up as a potential template for the management of other \u2018post-state\u2019 issues. However, as a consequence of its normative aspirations to representation and power sharing, the multistakeholder approach to global Internet governance has received little critical attention. This paper examines the issues of legitimacy and accountability with regard to the \u2018rule-makers\u2019 and \u2018rule-takers\u2019 in this model and finds that it can also function as a mechanism for the reinforcement of existing power dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyber", "Global governance", "Gramsci", "Internet"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922032438", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"55859713100": {"Name": "Carr M.", "AuthorID": "55859713100", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Department of International Politics, Aberystwyth University"}}}
