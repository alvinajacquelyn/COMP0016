The paper presents and compares the far field modal power distributions for (i) 2 km and 3 km step-index multimode Hard Plastic Cladding Fibers, HPCF, (SI-MMF) with 200 \u03bcm silica core diameter, 0.37 numerical aperture (NA) and polymer cladding, (ii) a 10 m silica graded-index multimode fiber (GI-MMF) with 50 \u03bcm core diameter and 0.2 NA, and (ii) a near field Encircled Flux Mode Convertor or \"modcona\". A free space method for measuring the far field using a Lightemitting diode (LED) centered at 850 nm wavelength with 40 nm 10 dB-bandwidth and a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera is compared with a f-theta multi-element lens based far field pattern (FFP) system. Mandrels of different diameter and different numbers of turns of the fiber around them were used to achieve an equilibrium mode distribution (EMD) for the GI-MMF. The paper defines encircled angular flux (EAF) as the fraction of the total optical power radiating from a multimode optical fiber core within a certain solid angle in the far field. The paper calculates the EAF when the solid angle increases from the far field centroid.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EAF", "encircled angular flux", "equilibrium modal distribution", "far field", "Fraunhofer diffraction", "GIMMF", "mandrel", "modal power distribution", "SIMMF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angular flux", "EAF", "Far field", "Fraunhofer diffraction", "GIMMF", "mandrel", "Modal power distributions", "SIMMF"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930144149", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55236758200": {"Name": "Tao R.", "AuthorID": "55236758200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "25930251000": {"Name": "Baghsiahi H.", "AuthorID": "25930251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "35606973700": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez F.A.", "AuthorID": "35606973700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "6603738758": {"Name": "Selviah D.R.", "AuthorID": "6603738758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "56661548600": {"Name": "Hayashi T.", "AuthorID": "56661548600", "AffiliationID": "115289431", "AffiliationName": "HAT Lab.
