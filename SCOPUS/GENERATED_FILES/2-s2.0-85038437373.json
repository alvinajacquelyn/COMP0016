Cryo-electron tomography reveals that microtubules assembled from S. pombe tubulin have predominantly B-lattice interprotofilament contacts, with protofilaments skewed around the microtubule axis. Copolymerization with Mal3 favors 13 protofilament microtubules with reduced protofilament skew, indicating that Mal3 adjusts interprotofilament interfaces. A 4.6-\u00c5 resolution structure of microtubule-bound Mal3 shows that Mal3 makes a distinctive footprint on the S. pombe microtubule lattice and that unlike mammalian microtubules, S. pombe microtubules do not show the longitudinal lattice compaction associated with EB protein binding and GTP hydrolysis. Our results firmly support a structural plasticity view of microtubule dynamics in which microtubule lattice conformation is sensitive to a variety of effectors and differently so for different tubulins.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Microtubules", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Conformation", "Nucleotides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins", "Tubulin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038437373", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"44462114700": {"Name": "Von Loeffelholz O.", "AuthorID": "44462114700", "AffiliationID": "106722222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Biology, Department of Integrated Structural Biology, Institute of Genetics and of Molecular and Cellular Biology"}, "6701857441": {"Name": "Moores C.A.", "AuthorID": "6701857441", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "57199847005": {"Name": "Venables N.A.", "AuthorID": "57199847005", "AffiliationID": "60120602, 60003771", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester"}, "36847214000": {"Name": "Drummond D.R.", "AuthorID": "36847214000", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Promotion of International Education and Research, Faculty of Agriculture, Kyushu University"}, "7103135763": {"Name": "Katsuki M.", "AuthorID": "7103135763", "AffiliationID": "60031720", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth System Science, Faculty of Science, Fukuoka University"}, "7202235831": {"Name": "Cross R.", "AuthorID": "7202235831", "AffiliationID": "60000064", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Cell Biology, Warwick Medical School"}}}
