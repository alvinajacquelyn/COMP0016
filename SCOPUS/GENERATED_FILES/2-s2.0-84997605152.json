Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.We demonstrate, for the first time, the multiplexed determination of microbial species from whole blood using the paper-folding technique of origami to enable the sequential steps of DNA extraction, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), and array-based fluorescence detection. A low-cost handheld flashlight reveals the presence of the final DNA amplicon to the naked eye, providing a \u201csample-to-answer\u201d diagnosis from a finger-prick volume of human blood, within 45 min, with minimal user intervention. To demonstrate the method, we showed the identification of three species of Plasmodium, analyzing 80 patient samples benchmarked against the gold-standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in an operator-blinded study. We also show that the test retains its diagnostic accuracy when using stored or fixed reference samples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnostics", "malaria", "microfluidics", "nucleic acid based test", "paper origami"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diagnostic accuracy", "DNA extraction", "Fluorescence detection", "Gold standards", "Loop mediated isothermal amplifications", "malaria", "Microbial species", "User intervention", "Humans", "Malaria", "Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques", "Paper", "Plasmodium", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997605152", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"36524139500": {"Name": "Xu G.", "AuthorID": "36524139500", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "6506525676": {"Name": "Nolder D.", "AuthorID": "6506525676", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England Malaria Reference Laboratory (PHE MRL), Faculty of Infectious & Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7102816903": {"Name": "Sutherland C.J.", "AuthorID": "7102816903", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Immunology & Infection, Faculty of Infectious & Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "36010742300": {"Name": "Oguike M.C.", "AuthorID": "36010742300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Immunology & Infection, Faculty of Infectious & Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "6701772417": {"Name": "van Schalkwyk D.A.", "AuthorID": "6701772417", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Immunology & Infection, Faculty of Infectious & Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}}}
