The clinical features of \u201cessential tremor\u201d overlap with or may be part of other tremor disorders and, not surprisingly, this prevalent familial disorder has remained without a gene identified, without a consistent natural history, and without an acceptable pathology or pathophysiologic underpinning. The collective evidence suggests that under the rubric of essential tremor there exists multiple unique diseases, some of which represent cerebellar dysfunction, but for which there is no intrinsic \u201cessence\u201d other than a common oscillatory behavior on posture and action. One approach may be to use the term essential tremor only as a transitional node in the deep phenotyping of tremor disorders based on historical, phenomenological, and neurophysiological features to facilitate its etiologic diagnosis or serve for future gene- and biomarker-discovery efforts. This approach deemphasizes essential tremor as a diagnostic entity and facilitates the understanding of the underlying disorders to develop biologically tailored diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarkers", "essential tremor", "nomenclature", "tremor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Essential Tremor", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015808841", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6507630454": {"Name": "Espay A.J.", "AuthorID": "6507630454", "AffiliationID": "60122649, 60025152", "AffiliationName": "UC Gardner Neuroscience Institute, Department of Neurology, Gardner Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders, University of Cincinnati"}, "20435871500": {"Name": "Merola A.", "AuthorID": "20435871500", "AffiliationID": "60122649, 60025152", "AffiliationName": "UC Gardner Neuroscience Institute, Department of Neurology, Gardner Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders, University of Cincinnati"}, "36042140400": {"Name": "Lang A.E.", "AuthorID": "36042140400", "AffiliationID": "101253185", "AffiliationName": "Krembil Research Institute"}, "14422094000": {"Name": "Fasano A.", "AuthorID": "14422094000", "AffiliationID": "101253185", "AffiliationName": "Krembil Research Institute"}, "36008087300": {"Name": "Erro R.", "AuthorID": "36008087300", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Science, University of Verona"}, "7101726642": {"Name": "Berardelli A.", "AuthorID": "7101726642", "AffiliationID": "60023773", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Neuromed"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
