Here, a novel low-temperature and solution-process approach to achieve WF tuning in HTLs is proposed. Specifically, the HTLs made from 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzylphosphonic acid (F5BnPA) incorporated graphene oxide (GO) and molybdenum oxide (MoOx) solution (representing two possible classes of HTLs where carriers transport via valence and conduction bands, respectively) offer continuous WF tuning (the tuning range as large as 0.81 eV) by controlling F5BnPA's concentration. By employing a deep HOMO donor material, OSCs using the composite HTLs can achieve improved performances with largely increased VOC (0.92 V for GO:F5BnPA versus 0.65 V for pristine GO; 0.91 V for MoOx:F5BnPA versus 0.88 V for pristine MoOx). The enhanced performance can be experimentally and theoretically explained by the decreased hole injection barrier (HIB) for GO or equivalent HIB (i.e. electron extraction barrier) for MoOx and enhanced surface recombination velocity, which contribute to eliminating S-shaped current-voltage characteristics. Consequently, the incorporation of F5BnPA can efficiently tune HTL WF for high VOC OSCs and extend HTL applications in organic electronics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carriers transport", "Electron extraction", "Energy level alignment", "Highest occupied molecular orbital", "Hole injection barriers", "Hole transport layers", "Organic electronics", "Organic solar cell"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948394928", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56621708900": {"Name": "Cheng J.", "AuthorID": "56621708900", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "45961747700": {"Name": "Xie F.", "AuthorID": "45961747700", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "55308680600": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "55308680600", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "7006202371": {"Name": "Choy W.", "AuthorID": "7006202371", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "55878670100": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "55878670100", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California"}, "56594211600": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "56594211600", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of California"}}}
