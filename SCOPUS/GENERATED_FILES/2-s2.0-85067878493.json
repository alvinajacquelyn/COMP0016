Here, a 66-yr-old female presented with nil requirement for postoperative analgesia after a normally painful orthopaedic hand surgery (trapeziectomy). Further investigations revealed a lifelong history of painless injuries, such as frequent cuts and burns, which were observed to heal quickly. We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder: the co-inheritance of (i) a microdeletion in dorsal root ganglia and brain-expressed pseudogene, FAAH-OUT, which we cloned from the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) chromosomal region; and (ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in FAAH conferring reduced expression and activity. Circulating concentrations of anandamide and related fatty-acid amides (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism. The genetic findings and elevated circulating fatty-acid amides are consistent with a phenotype resulting from enhanced endocannabinoid signalling and a loss of function of FAAH. Our results highlight previously unknown complexity at the FAAH genomic locus involving the expression of FAAH-OUT, a novel pseudogene and long non-coding RNA. These data suggest new routes to develop FAAH-based analgesia by targeting of FAAH-OUT, which could significantly improve the treatment of postoperative pain and potentially chronic pain and anxiety disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anandamide", "anxiolytic", "endocannabinoids", "pain insensitivity", "postoperative analgesia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amidohydrolases", "Arachidonic Acids", "Endocannabinoids", "Female", "Humans", "Pain Insensitivity, Congenital", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Polyunsaturated Alkamides", "Pseudogenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067878493", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"10142504100": {"Name": "Habib A.M.", "AuthorID": "10142504100", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Member of Qatar Health Cluster, Qatar University"}, "7007120879": {"Name": "Okorokov A.L.", "AuthorID": "7007120879", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "57209879798": {"Name": "Lee M.C.", "AuthorID": "57209879798", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care, University of California"}, "57200569287": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "57200569287", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "7801629708": {"Name": "Gossage S.J.", "AuthorID": "7801629708", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "7404023146": {"Name": "Cox J.J.", "AuthorID": "7404023146", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "7404447458": {"Name": "Hill M.N.", "AuthorID": "7404447458", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Departments of Cell Biology and Anatomy and Psychiatry, University of Calgary"}, "41361661700": {"Name": "Morena M.", "AuthorID": "41361661700", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Hotchkiss Brain Institute, Departments of Cell Biology and Anatomy and Psychiatry, University of Calgary"}, "57200436456": {"Name": "Bras J.T.", "AuthorID": "57200436456", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57209881112": {"Name": "van Drimmelen M.", "AuthorID": "57209881112", "AffiliationID": "60004450", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Raigmore Hospital"}, "36197218700": {"Name": "Ramirez J.D.", "AuthorID": "36197218700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "35560851800": {"Name": "Bennett D.L.H.", "AuthorID": "35560851800", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "55497181500": {"Name": "Srivastava D.", "AuthorID": "55497181500", "AffiliationID": "60004450", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Raigmore Hospital"}}}
