All rights reserved.The EU landfill and Waste Framework directives are driving new approaches to waste management in the UK, away from landfilling and mass-burn incineration, which has been regarded as the main alternative to landfilling. The objective of this study is to compare the environmental impacts of three dual-stage advanced energy-from-waste technologies, i.e. gasification and plasma gas cleaning, fast pyrolysis and combustion and gasification with syngas combustion, with those associated with conventional treatments for municipal solid waste, i.e. landfill with electricity production and incineration with electricity production. Results show that the two-stage gasification and plasma process has a significantly better overall environmental performance than the conventional waste treatment technologies and somewhat better than a more modern incineration plant, exemplified by a plant under commissioning in Lincolnshire in the UK. The benefits of the gasification and plasma process arise primarily from its higher net electrical efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Combustion", "Energy-from-waste technology", "Gasification", "Life cycle assessment", "Pyrolysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conventional treatments", "Electricity production", "Energy from wastes", "Environmental performance", "Framework directives", "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)", "Net electrical efficiency", "Treatment technologies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930377766", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"54966700100": {"Name": "Evangelisti S.", "AuthorID": "54966700100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "55845455200": {"Name": "Tagliaferri C.", "AuthorID": "55845455200", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Advance Plasma Power (APP)"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "56196096800": {"Name": "Taylor R.", "AuthorID": "56196096800", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Advance Plasma Power (APP)"}, "7403167306": {"Name": "Chapman C.", "AuthorID": "7403167306", "AffiliationID": "60112883", "AffiliationName": "Advance Plasma Power (APP)"}, "7101769541": {"Name": "Clift R.", "AuthorID": "7101769541", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Strategy, University of Surrey"}}}
