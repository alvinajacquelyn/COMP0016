The prevalence of hypertension in Nigeria forms a substantial portion of the total burden in Africa because of the large population of the country currently estimated to be over 170 million. Objective The purpose of this systematic review is to summarise up to date data on the prevalence and distribution of hypertension in Nigeria from prevalence studies. Methods A search of the following databases: PubMed, EMBase and WHO cardiovascular InfoBase from 1968 till date was conducted to identify studies which provide estimates of prevalence of hypertension in Nigeria. Results The search yielded a total of 1748 hits from which 45 relevant studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The overall crude prevalence of hypertension ranged from 0.1% (95% CI:-0.1 to 0.3) to 17.5% (95% CI: 13.6 to 21.4) in children and 2.1% (95%CI: 1.4 to 2.8) to 47.2% (95%CI: 43.6 to 50.8) in adults depending on the benchmark used for diagnosis of hypertension, the setting in which the study was conducted, sex and ethnic group. The crude prevalence of hypertension ranged from 6.2% (95%CI: 4.0 to 8.4) to 48.9% (95%CI: 42.3 to 55.5) for men and 10% (95%CI: 8.1 to 12) to 47.3% (95%CI: 43 to 51.6%) for women. In most studies, prevalence of hypertension was higher in males than females. In addition, prevalence across urban and rural ranged from 9.5% (95%CI: 13.6 to 21.4) to 51.6% (95%CI: 49.8 to 53.4) and 4.8% (95%CI: 2.9 to 6.7) to 43% (95%CI: 42.1 to 43.9) respectively. Conclusions The prevalence of hypertension is high among the Nigerian population. Appropriate interventions need to be developed and implemented to reduce the preventable burden of hypertension especially at Primary Health Care Centres which is the first point of call for over 55% of the Nigerian population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Pressure", "Child", "Confidence Intervals", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Geography", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Nigeria", "Prevalence", "Publication Bias"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948807342", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56986573600": {"Name": "Akinlua J.", "AuthorID": "56986573600", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}, "6701439139": {"Name": "Meakin R.", "AuthorID": "6701439139", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}, "57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}, "57213235526": {"Name": "Umar A.", "AuthorID": "57213235526", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "College of Science and Technology, University of Salford"}}}
