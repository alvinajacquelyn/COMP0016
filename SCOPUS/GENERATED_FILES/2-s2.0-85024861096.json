The approach is based on iterative latent variable preselection, where we alternate between learning a selection function to reveal the relevant latent variables and using this to obtain a compact approximation of the posterior distribution for EM. This can make inference possible where the number of possible latent states is, for example, exponential in the number of latent variables, whereas an exact approach would be computationally infeasible.We learn the selection function entirely from the observed data and current expectation-maximization state via gaussian process regression. This is in contrast to earlier approaches, where selection functions were manually designed for each problem setting. We show that our approach performs as well as these bespoke selection functions on a wide variety of inference problems. In particular, for the challenging case of a hierarchical model for object localization with occlusion, we achieve results that match a customized state-of-the-art selection method at a far lower computational cost.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive subspaces", "Compact approximation", "Computational costs", "Expectation - maximizations", "Gaussian process regression", "Object localization", "Posterior distributions", "Selection function"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024861096", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"38362455600": {"Name": "Shelton J.A.", "AuthorID": "38362455600", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Technical University Berlin"}, "34874812300": {"Name": "Gasthaus J.", "AuthorID": "34874812300", "AffiliationID": "60076757", "AffiliationName": "Amazon Development Center"}, "6603257032": {"Name": "Gretton A.", "AuthorID": "6603257032", "AffiliationID": "60084280", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Gatsby Unit"}, "55420047500": {"Name": "Dai Z.", "AuthorID": "55420047500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "13104958300": {"Name": "L\u00fccke J.", "AuthorID": "13104958300", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "University of Oldenburg"}}}
