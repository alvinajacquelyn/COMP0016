We examined whether sleep parameters can be estimated from these data in the absence of sleep diaries. Our heuristic algorithm uses the variance in estimated z-axis angle and makes basic assumptions about sleep interruptions. Detected sleep period time window (SPT-window) was compared against sleep diary in 3752 participants (range = 60\u201382 years) and polysomnography in sleep clinic patients (N = 28) and in healthy good sleepers (N = 22). The SPT-window derived from the algorithm was 10.9 and 2.9 minutes longer compared with sleep diary in men and women, respectively. Mean C-statistic to detect the SPT-window compared to polysomnography was 0.86 and 0.83 in clinic-based and healthy sleepers, respectively. We demonstrated the accuracy of our algorithm to detect the SPT-window. The value of this algorithm lies in studies such as UK Biobank where a sleep diary was not used.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Algorithms", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sleep", "Wearable Electronic Devices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052398735", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56904096900": {"Name": "van Hees V.T.", "AuthorID": "56904096900", "AffiliationID": "60159380", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands eScience Center"}, "24339408800": {"Name": "Sabia S.", "AuthorID": "24339408800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "57203585576": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux B.A.", "AuthorID": "57203585576", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology & Public Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "56924115000": {"Name": "Jones S.E.", "AuthorID": "56924115000", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, Genetics of Complex Traits"}, "36505189800": {"Name": "Wood A.R.", "AuthorID": "36505189800", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, Genetics of Complex Traits"}, "57216482949": {"Name": "Frayling T.M.", "AuthorID": "57216482949", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, Genetics of Complex Traits"}, "6603919352": {"Name": "Weedon M.N.", "AuthorID": "6603919352", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, Genetics of Complex Traits"}, "7404580305": {"Name": "Anderson K.N.", "AuthorID": "7404580305", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Regional Sleep Service, Freeman Hospital"}, "57210718293": {"Name": "Pack A.I.", "AuthorID": "57210718293", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "26534605100": {"Name": "Mazzotti D.R.", "AuthorID": "26534605100", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "6505811770": {"Name": "Gehrman P.R.", "AuthorID": "6505811770", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine"}, "7003455496": {"Name": "Bucan M.", "AuthorID": "7003455496", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine"}, "7801560103": {"Name": "Trenell M.I.", "AuthorID": "7801560103", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Movelab, Newcastle University"}}}
