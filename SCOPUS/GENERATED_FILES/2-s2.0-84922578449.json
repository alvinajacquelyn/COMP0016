Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Science Direct, LILACS, IndMed and AIM databases (2003-2013) and IAS/AIDS conference abstracts (2011-2013) were searched for tracing studies reporting the proportion of traced patients found to have self-transferred, died or stopped ART. These estimates were then combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Results: Twenty eight studies were eligible for inclusion, reporting true outcomes for 10 806 traced patients attending approximately 258 ART facilities. None were from outside sub-Saharan Africa. Twenty three studies reported 4.5-54.4% traced LTFU patients self-transferring care, providing a pooled estimate of 18.6% (95% CI 15.8-22.0%). A significant positive association was found between rates of self-transfer and LTFU in the ART cohort. The pooled estimates for unreported deaths were 38.8% (95% CI 30.8-46.8%; 27 studies) and 28.6% (95% CI 21.9-36.0%; 20 studies) for patients stopping ART. A significant decrease in unreported deaths from 50.0% (95% CI 41.5-58.4%) to 30.0% (95% CI 21.1-38.9%) was found comparing study periods before and after 31 December 2007. Conclusions: Substantial unaccounted for transfers and deaths amongst patients LTFU confirms that retention and mortality is underestimated where the true outcomes of LTFU patients are not ascertained.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "Continuity of care", "Human immunodeficiency virus", "Lost to follow-up", "Mortality", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Africa South of the Sahara", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Developing Countries", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Lost to Follow-Up", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Patient Transfer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922578449", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"14422687800": {"Name": "Wilkinson L.S.", "AuthorID": "14422687800", "AffiliationID": "60006704", "AffiliationName": "Medecins Sans Frontieres"}, "26654536200": {"Name": "Skordis-Worrall J.", "AuthorID": "26654536200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}, "54949706600": {"Name": "Ajose O.", "AuthorID": "54949706600", "AffiliationID": "60120623", "AffiliationName": "Clinton Health Access Initiative"}, "7102556235": {"Name": "Ford N.", "AuthorID": "7102556235", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization"}}}
