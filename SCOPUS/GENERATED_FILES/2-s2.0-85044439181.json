Specifically we highlight two effects that spatial segregation may have: (1) it can efficiently separate the individual effort choices of highly and low productive individuals, (2) it may imply that the median voter imposes a level of redistribution that is inefficient from the aggregate point of view. The trade-off implies that segregated and non-segregated cities may present very similar levels of aggregate welfare. We employ this framework to discuss how the structure of cities can play a role in the determination of US-type and Europe-type politico-economic equilibria and the implications for planning policies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Median voter", "Redistribution", "Spatial segregation", "Welfare"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044439181", "SubjectAreas": [["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"37103681600": {"Name": "Gabrieli T.", "AuthorID": "37103681600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
