The impact of immunosuppression on renal and overall survival is unknown. Methods: Patients were recruited from 2005 to 2016 from 8 centers worldwide (N = 16) for this descriptive study. All had positive ANCA, elevated serum creatinine with active urine sediment, histologic evidence of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis without active lesions, and had no evidence of extrarenal vasculitis. We describe the characteristics of this cohort and the differences in the clinical, histologic, and therapeutic parameters of those who developed primary outcomes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and vasculitis relapse. Results: The cohort was 63% Caucasian, and 75% were men, with a median age of 62 years. At entry, the mean \u00b1 SD estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 24 \u00b1 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and 5 patients required dialysis. Twelve patients received immunosuppressive therapy, 25% experienced disease relapse, and 38% developed ESRD. Patients who developed ESRD had lower baseline eGFRs (8 \u00b1 5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 vs. 35 \u00b1 18 ml/min per 1.73 m2; P = 0.001) and more often required dialysis at presentation (83% vs. 0%; P = 0.001). Patients who relapsed were less likely to receive immunosuppression (25% for the relapsed group vs. 92% for the nonrelapsed group; relative risk: 0.27, risk difference: 67%; P = 0.03). Conclusion: Among these patients, lower initial eGFR and dialysis dependence at presentation might increase the risk for ESRD. Immunosuppression did not affect renal outcomes in this sample of patients but was associated with a reduced risk for vasculitis relapse. More information is needed on factors that predict treatment response in this high-risk group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ANCA-associated vasculitis", "glomerulonephritis", "renal limited vasculitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043989966", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"55940032700": {"Name": "Novick T.K.", "AuthorID": "55940032700", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University"}, "22953320400": {"Name": "Geetha D.", "AuthorID": "22953320400", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University"}, "57192926273": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "57192926273", "AffiliationID": "60121971", "AffiliationName": "Peking University First Hospital"}, "57201216650": {"Name": "Scott J.", "AuthorID": "57201216650", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Center, Tallaght Hospital"}, "26643059400": {"Name": "Little M.A.", "AuthorID": "26643059400", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Center, Tallaght Hospital"}, "16068097000": {"Name": "Cortazar F.B.", "AuthorID": "16068097000", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "36179337600": {"Name": "Ayoub I.", "AuthorID": "36179337600", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Ohio State University"}, "24484751300": {"Name": "Hruskova Z.", "AuthorID": "24484751300", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Charles University Prague"}, "55366513900": {"Name": "Salama A.D.", "AuthorID": "55366513900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7003476140": {"Name": "Pagnoux C.", "AuthorID": "7003476140", "AffiliationID": "60014468, 60006894", "AffiliationName": "Mount Sinai Hospital, University Health Network"}}}
