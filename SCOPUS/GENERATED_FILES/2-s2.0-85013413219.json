For permission to use (where not already granted under a licence) please go to http://www.bmj.com/company/products-services/rights-and-licensing/.The impact of immunosuppression on interferon-\u03b3release assays and novel cytokine biomarkers of TB infection, mycobacteria-specific IL-2, IP-10 and TNF-\u03b1 responses was investigated in an ex vivo model. Cytokine responses in standard QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-Tube (QFT-GIT) assays were compared with duplicate assays containing dexamethasone or infliximab. Dexamethasone converted QFT-GIT results from positive to negative in 30% of participants. Antigen-stimulated interferon-\u03b3, IL-2 and TNF-\u03b1 responses were markedly reduced, but IP-10 responses were preserved. Infliximab caused QFT-GIT result conversion in up to 30% of participants and substantial reductions in all cytokine responses. Therefore, corticosteroids and anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents significantly impair interferon-\u03b3release assay performance. IP-10 may be a more robust TB biomarker than interferon-\u03b3in patients receiving corticosteroids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Aged", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Dexamethasone", "Female", "Humans", "Infliximab", "Interferon-gamma", "Interferon-gamma Release Tests", "Interleukin-2", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013413219", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57193384716": {"Name": "Edwards A.", "AuthorID": "57193384716", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "56352365700": {"Name": "Allan R.N.", "AuthorID": "56352365700", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Nihr Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "55982722800": {"Name": "De Graaf H.", "AuthorID": "55982722800", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "56573779800": {"Name": "Coelho T.", "AuthorID": "56573779800", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "7006081265": {"Name": "Faust S.N.", "AuthorID": "7006081265", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "36787177700": {"Name": "Mansour S.", "AuthorID": "36787177700", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "7202280116": {"Name": "Marshall B.", "AuthorID": "7202280116", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "57194531731": {"Name": "Elkington P.", "AuthorID": "57194531731", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospital Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "55911967000": {"Name": "Tebruegge M.", "AuthorID": "55911967000", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Infectious Diseases and Immunology, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "57200726133": {"Name": "Gao Y.", "AuthorID": "57200726133", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Cruk Nihr Southampton Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "7405838957": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "7405838957", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Investigational Sciences Hub, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "57193394290": {"Name": "Ball D.", "AuthorID": "57193394290", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Nihr Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, University Hospital Southampton Nhs Foundation Trust"}, "26422792000": {"Name": "Clifford V.", "AuthorID": "26422792000", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}, "7102229084": {"Name": "Curtis N.", "AuthorID": "7102229084", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60009102", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Murdoch Children's Research Institute"}}}
