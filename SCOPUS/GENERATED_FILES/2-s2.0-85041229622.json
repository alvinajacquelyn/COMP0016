These analytic expressions are more general than those existing in the literature and include the residual binding potential in the electron continuum propagation. They successfully reproduce the ATI side lobes and specific holographic structures such as the near-threshold fan-shaped pattern and the spider-like structure that extends up to relatively high photoelectron energies. We compare such expressions with the Coulomb quantum orbit strong-field approximation (CQSFA) and the full solution of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation for different driving-field frequencies and intensities, and provide an in-depth analysis of the physical mechanisms behind specific holographic structures. Our results shed additional light on what aspects of the CQSFA must be prioritized in order to obtain the key holographic features, and highlight the importance of forward scattered trajectories. Furthermore, we find that the holographic patterns change considerably for different field parameters, even if the Keldysh parameter is kept roughly the same.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coulomb corrections", "photoelectron holography", "quantum trajectories", "strong-field physics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Above-threshold ionization", "Coulomb corrections", "Photoelectron angular distributions", "Photoelectron holographies", "Quantum trajectories", "Strong-field approximations", "Strong-field physics", "Transition probabilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041229622", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56816436900": {"Name": "Maxwell A.", "AuthorID": "56816436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57195531120": {"Name": "Al-Jawahiry A.", "AuthorID": "57195531120", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56147334400": {"Name": "De Morisson Faria C.", "AuthorID": "56147334400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "26534484500": {"Name": "Lai X.", "AuthorID": "26534484500", "AffiliationID": "60019706, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
