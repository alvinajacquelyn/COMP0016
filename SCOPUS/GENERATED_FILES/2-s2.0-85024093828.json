Sir Charles Hanbury Williams (1708\u20131759) was a celebrated poet, wit and diplomat in his own lifetime but is now largely forgotten. The copious surviving manuscripts of his correspondence and verses provide rich and explicit material for an examination of mid-eighteenth-century libertinism from two perspectives \u2013 that of its ribald practitioners and that of an ex-libertine father and mentor \u2013 within the context of scholarly debates on eighteenth-century politeness and masculinities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Libertinism", "Masculinity", "Paternity", "Politeness", "Sexuality", "Sir Charles Hanbury Williams"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024093828", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"57194899170": {"Name": "Butterwick-Pawlikowski R.", "AuthorID": "57194899170", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London"}}}
