The current study therefore had two goals. First, to harvest accounts of such putative events from transcripts of interviews in samples enriched for such potential experiences. Second, to use the derived data to generate items for a new questionnaire that can be used for monitoring such events in medication trials or routine clinical care. Methods: Following a literature search aimed at identifying associations between MPH and cognition and/or motivation, a qualitative semistructured interview was designed to focus specifically on the domains of cognition (i.e., reasoning, depth/breadth of thinking, intellectual capacity, and creativity) and motivation (i.e., drive, effort, and attitudes toward rewards/incentives). Interviews were conducted with 45 participants drawn from the following four groups: (a) clinicians, child and adolescent psychiatrists, and pediatricians specializing in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (n = 15); (2) teachers, with experience of teaching at least 10 medicated children with ADHD (n = 10); (3) parents of children with ADHD (n = 8) treated with MPH; and (4) adolescents/adults with ADHD (n = 12). Purposeful sampling was used to selectively recruit ADHD participants whose histories suggested a degree of vulnerability to MPH adverse events. Data were analyzed using a deductive approach to content analysis. Results: While we probed purposefully for cognitive and motivational adverse events, a third domain, related to mood, emerged from the reports. Therefore, three domains, each with a number of subdomains, were identified from the interview accounts: (i) Cognition (six subdomains; attention/concentration, changes in thinking, reduced creativity, sensory overload, memory, slower processing speed); (ii) motivation (four subdomains; loss of intrinsic motivation for goal-directed activities, external locus of control, lack of effort/engagement in daily tasks, increased focus on incentives); and (iii) mood (three subdomains; dampening of spontaneity/flat affect, mood dysregulation, increased anxiety/edginess). On the basis of these reports, 34 items were specified and incorporated into a prototype questionnaire, which was piloted and refined on the basis of field-testing. Conclusions: Items were identified that capture potential/perceived cognitive, motivational, and mood-related adverse events of MPH. The items generated will allow us to further develop and psychometrically examine their prevalence, and the extent to which they are associated with medication adherence, treatment outcome, impairment, and other reported adverse events (e.g., loss of appetite/cardiovascular effects).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affect", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Central Nervous System Stimulants", "Child", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Methylphenidate", "Motivation", "Pilot Projects", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983595583", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"8890048100": {"Name": "Kovshoff H.", "AuthorID": "8890048100", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Psychology, Developmental Brain Behaviour Laboratory, University of Southampton"}, "57190868566": {"Name": "Grimshaw D.G.", "AuthorID": "57190868566", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Psychology, Developmental Brain Behaviour Laboratory, University of Southampton"}, "14526195300": {"Name": "Thompson M.", "AuthorID": "14526195300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Psychology, Developmental Brain Behaviour Laboratory, University of Southampton"}, "7005682785": {"Name": "Sonuga-Barke E.J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005682785", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University"}, "6603935963": {"Name": "Banaschewski T.", "AuthorID": "6603935963", "AffiliationID": "60016908, 60005285", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Central Institute of Mental Health, University of Heidelberg"}, "26640178500": {"Name": "Buitelaar J.K.", "AuthorID": "26640178500", "AffiliationID": "60002573, 60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Centre, Donders Institute for Brain, Department of Cognitive Neuroscience and Karakter Child and Adolescent Psychiatry University Centre"}, "36660564800": {"Name": "Carucci S.", "AuthorID": "36660564800", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Biomedical Science, University of Cagliari"}, "7003979777": {"Name": "Zuddas A.", "AuthorID": "7003979777", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit, Department of Biomedical Science, University of Cagliari"}, "6603562184": {"Name": "Coghill D.", "AuthorID": "6603562184", "AffiliationID": "60024749, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Paediatrics and Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "6602331008": {"Name": "Danckaerts M.", "AuthorID": "6602331008", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Research Group Psychiatry"}, "7005218961": {"Name": "Dittmann R.W.", "AuthorID": "7005218961", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Psychopharmacology, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Heidelberg"}, "7003400734": {"Name": "Falissard B.", "AuthorID": "7003400734", "AffiliationID": "60106307, 60123796, 60106017, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1178, University Paris-Sud, University Paris-Descartes, AP-HP"}, "7006624553": {"Name": "Hollis C.", "AuthorID": "7006624553", "AffiliationID": "60024834, 60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Nottingham"}, "25628234500": {"Name": "Liddle E.", "AuthorID": "25628234500", "AffiliationID": "60024834, 60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Nottingham"}, "7005695774": {"Name": "Inglis S.", "AuthorID": "7005695774", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Tayside Clinical Trials Unit, University of Dundee"}, "7102334150": {"Name": "Konrad K.", "AuthorID": "7102334150", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM3), Research Centre Juelich"}, "26323217800": {"Name": "McCarthy S.", "AuthorID": "26323217800", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College Cork"}, "57212536835": {"Name": "Nagy P.", "AuthorID": "57212536835", "AffiliationID": "113216978", "AffiliationName": "Vadaskert Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Hospital"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60103563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine University of Hong Kong"}}}
