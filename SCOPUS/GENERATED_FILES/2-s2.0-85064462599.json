We assessed temporal trends in pretreatment HIV-1 drug resistance (PDR) in ART-na\u00efve adults from South Africa. Methods: We included datasets from studies conducted between 2000 and 2016, with HIV-1 pol sequences from more than ten ART-na\u00efve adults. We analysed sequences for the presence of 101 drug resistance mutations. We pooled sequences by sampling year and performed a sequence-level analysis using a generalized linear mixed model, including the dataset as a random effect. Findings: We identified 38 datasets, and retrieved 6880 HIV-1 pol sequences for analysis. The pooled annual prevalence of PDR remained below 5% until 2009, then increased to a peak of 11\u00b79% (95% confidence interval (CI) 9\u00b72-15\u00b70) in 2015. The pooled annual prevalence of non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) PDR remained below 5% until 2011, then increased to 10.0% (95% CI 8.4\u201311.8) by 2014. Between 2000 and 2016, there was a 1.18-fold (95% CI 1.13\u20131.23) annual increase in NNRTI PDR (p < 0.001), and a 1.10-fold (95% CI 1.05\u20131.16) annual increase in nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor PDR (p = 0.001). Interpretation: Increasing PDR in South Africa presents a threat to the efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic. These findings support the recent decision to modify the standard first-line ART regimen, but also highlights the need for broader public health action to prevent the further emergence and transmission of drug-resistant HIV.
