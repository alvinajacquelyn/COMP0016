Studies were also carried out to measure the rate of water penetration from the different treatment methods into acrylic paints during continuous exposure. Unilateral NMR is shown to be an effective technique for comparing depth penetration of water during cleaning treatments; the volume of paint occupied by water can be extracted from these measurements. The results show that young paint films (1 month) are more prone to swelling than aged paint films (2-50 years), with light aged paints having the highest resistance to water penetration during treatments. Aged organic pigmented acrylic paint (Hansa yellow light) shows a higher propensity for swelling during cleaning than aged titanium dioxide white paint. Cleaning simulations using water-moistened swabs and agar gels deposit approximately equivalent amounts of water into the paint films, whilst all other gel systems tested, with the exception of Velvesil Plus, tend to allow approximately 50% more water into the paint films. None of the aqueous thickened cleaning systems tested reduced the quantity of water which entered the paint films relative to swab cleaning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acrylic paints", "Cleaning treatment", "Gels", "Heritage science", "Unilateral NMR", "Water diffusion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942811356", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"36129454700": {"Name": "Angelova L.V.", "AuthorID": "36129454700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of History of Art, University College London"}, "55976550800": {"Name": "Richardson E.", "AuthorID": "55976550800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of History of Art, University College London"}, "21934684200": {"Name": "Ormsby B.", "AuthorID": "21934684200", "AffiliationID": "101196088", "AffiliationName": "Conservation Science Tate, Millbank"}}}
