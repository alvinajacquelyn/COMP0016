They consider five competing specifications of this model. In this note, we present a Bayesian statistical method to test these five competing specifications, taking the hierarchical nature of the data into account. While this paper is a follow-up to Aksoy and Weesie (2013), the method we discuss is suitable to test multiple comparative statics and is, thus, useful to asses the fit of other game-theoretic models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian inference", "cooperation", "methodology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946594465", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"35101337800": {"Name": "Aksoy O.", "AuthorID": "35101337800", "AffiliationID": "60010018, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology and Nuffield Centre for Experimental Social Sciences, Nuffield College, University of Oxford"}, "6506686321": {"Name": "Weesie J.", "AuthorID": "6506686321", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "ICS/Department of Sociology, Utrecht University"}}}
