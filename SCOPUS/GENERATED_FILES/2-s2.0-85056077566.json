We investigate whether serum neurofilament light (NfL) concentration is associated with clinical and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers in ADAD. We also evaluate serum NfL differences between clinical groups. Methods: Serum NfL was measured cross-sectionally in 60 individuals from ADAD families using an ultrasensitive immunoassay on the Single molecule array (Simoa) platform and longitudinally in an exploratory study in a subset of six mutation carriers. Spearman coefficients assessed associations between serum NfL and relevant measures. Differences between groups were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. Results: Forty-two participants were mutation carriers: 22 symptomatic (SMC) and 20 asymptomatic (AMC). Eighteen subjects were non-carriers and cognitively normal (controls (CTR)). Serum NfL correlated with the estimated years from symptoms onset across mutation carriers (rho = 0.75, p < 0.001). In mutation carriers, serum NfL also showed strong correlation with clinical (rho = 0.70, p < 0.001) and cognitive (rho = -0.77, p < 0.001) measures and CSF NfL, total tau and phosphorylated tau levels (rho = 0.72, 0.71, and 0.71, respectively, all p < 0.001). Serum NfL concentration was higher in SMC than in AMC and CTR. Conclusions: Serum NfL might be a feasible non-invasive biomarker to track disease onset and severity in ADAD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Biomarkers", "Familial Alzheimer's disease", "Neurofilament light", "Presenilin 1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056077566", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"6602405836": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Valle R.", "AuthorID": "6602405836", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednic, Institut d'Investigaci\u00f3 Biom\u00e8dica August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona"}, "23102004600": {"Name": "Bosch B.", "AuthorID": "23102004600", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednic, Institut d'Investigaci\u00f3 Biom\u00e8dica August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona"}, "19639871300": {"Name": "Antonell A.", "AuthorID": "19639871300", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednic, Institut d'Investigaci\u00f3 Biom\u00e8dica August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona"}, "36668211900": {"Name": "Balasa M.", "AuthorID": "36668211900", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednic, Institut d'Investigaci\u00f3 Biom\u00e8dica August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona"}, "23493093400": {"Name": "Llad\u00f3 A.", "AuthorID": "23493093400", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease and Other Cognitive Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednic, Institut d'Investigaci\u00f3 Biom\u00e8dica August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona"}, "36463576300": {"Name": "Heslegrave A.", "AuthorID": "36463576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "57193198963": {"Name": "Foiani M.S.", "AuthorID": "57193198963", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, University College of London, Institute of Neurology"}}}
