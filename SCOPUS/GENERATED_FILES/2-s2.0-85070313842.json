By framing the results of the technological study using SEM-EDS and thin-section petrography within the historical context, we are able to establish the link between local production and broader technological and socio-historical developments. The early glaze technology in Cyprus appears to have followed the established traditions characteristic of the eastern Mediterranean region during the late medieval period. This is reflected in the use of high lead glaze, the addition of iron and copper oxide as colourants, and the use of painting and sgraffito as principal decorative techniques. Although the introduction of glaze production in Cyprus coincided with the time when the island fell under the Frankish rule, there is no evidence indicating that the Frankish rulers directly controlled the production or the Franks were involved in the actual production process. However, we argue that the establishment of the Frankish influence had indirectly stimulated the beginning of glazed ware production in Cyprus by facilitating the movement of labour and creating the market and demand required for such production through its link to the Crusaders' campaigns in the wider Levantine region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crusaders", "Cyprus", "Glaze technology", "Late medieval", "SEM-EDS", "Thin-section petrography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070313842", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"56725068900": {"Name": "Ting C.", "AuthorID": "56725068900", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Archaeological Research Unit, University of Cyprus"}, "26322895000": {"Name": "Vionis A.", "AuthorID": "26322895000", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Archaeological Research Unit, University of Cyprus"}, "6506084934": {"Name": "Kassianidou V.", "AuthorID": "6506084934", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Archaeological Research Unit, University of Cyprus"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60139025", "AffiliationName": "Science and Technology in Archaeology Research and Culture Center, The Cyprus Institute"}, "57210322771": {"Name": "Barker C.", "AuthorID": "57210322771", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney University Museums"}, "57210313906": {"Name": "Cook H.", "AuthorID": "57210313906", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
