These deficits are treatable with personal frequency-modulated systems (FMs). This study aimed to evaluate long-Term benefits in speech reception in noise, after daily 10-week use of personal FMs, in non-Aphasic patients with stroke with auditory processing deficits. Design This was a prospective non-randomised controlled trial study. Patients were allocated to an intervention care group or standard care subjects group according to their willingness to use the intervention or not. Setting Tertiary care setting. Participants Nine non-Aphasic subjects with ischaemic stroke, normal/near-normal audiometry and auditory processing deficits and with reported difficulties understanding speech in background noise were recruited in the subacute stroke stage (3-12\u00e2 \u20ac..months after stroke). Interventions Four patients (intervention care subjects) used the FMs in their daily life over 10\u00e2 \u20ac..weeks. Five patients (standard care subjects) received standard care. Primary outcome measures All subjects were tested at baseline (visit 1) and 10\u00e2 \u20ac..weeks later (visit 2) on a sentences in noise test with the FMs (aided) and without the FMs (unaided). Results Speech reception thresholds showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in intervention but not in standard care subjects at 10\u00e2 \u20ac..weeks in aided and unaided conditions. Conclusions 10-week use of FMs by adult patients with stroke may lead to benefits in unaided speech in noise perception. Our findings may indicate auditory plasticity type changes and require further investigation.
