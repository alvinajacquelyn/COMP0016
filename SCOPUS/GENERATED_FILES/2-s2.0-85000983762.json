In this article, we extend the approach to multivariable modeling by modifying the standard Stata program mfp. The result is a new program, mfpa, that has all the features of mfp plus the ability to fit a new model for userselected covariates that we call FP1(p1, p2). The FP1(p1, p2) model comprises the best-fitting combination of a dimension-one fractional polynomial (FP1) function of x and an FP1 function of ACD(x). We describe a new model-selection algorithm called function-selection procedure with ACD transformation, which uses significance testing to attempt to simplify an FP1(p1, p2) model to a submodel, an FP1 or linear model in x or in ACD(x). The function-selection procedure with ACD transformation is related in concept to the FSP (FP function-selection procedure), which is an integral part of mfp and which is used to simplify a dimension-two (FP2) function. We describe the mfpa command and give univariable and multivariable examples with real data to demonstrate its use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACD transformation", "Continuous covariates", "mfp", "mfpa", "Multivariable fractional polynomials", "Regression models", "Sigmoid function", "st0425"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000983762", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"]], "AuthorData": {"55561839500": {"Name": "Royston P.", "AuthorID": "55561839500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC, Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7006492726": {"Name": "Sauerbrei W.", "AuthorID": "7006492726", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Biometry and Medical Informatics, Medical Center-University of Freiburg"}}}
