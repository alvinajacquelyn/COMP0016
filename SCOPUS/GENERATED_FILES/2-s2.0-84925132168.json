In the present study we analysed functional properties of astrocytes in hippocampal specimens from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy without (n = 44) and with sclerosis (n = 75) combining patch clamp recording, K<sup>+</sup> concentration analysis, electroencephalography/video-monitoring, and fate mapping analysis. We found that the hippocampus of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with sclerosis is completely devoid of bona fide astrocytes and gap junction coupling, whereas coupled astrocytes were abundantly present in non-sclerotic specimens. To decide whether these glial changes represent cause or effect of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with sclerosis, we developed a mouse model that reproduced key features of human mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with sclerosis. In this model, uncoupling impaired K<sup>+</sup> buffering and temporally preceded apoptotic neuronal death and the generation of spontaneous seizures. Uncoupling was induced through intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide, prevented in Toll-like receptor4 knockout mice and reproduced in situ through acute cytokine or lipopolysaccharide incubation. Fate mapping confirmed that in the course of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with sclerosis, astrocytes acquire an atypical functional phenotype and lose coupling. These data suggest that astrocyte dysfunction might be a prime cause of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with sclerosis and identify novel targets for anti-epileptogenic therapeutic intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gap junction coupling", "Gap junction protein alpha 1", "Hippocampal sclerosis", "Inflammation", "Temporal lobe epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe", "Gap Junctions", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Sclerosis", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925132168", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6506169922": {"Name": "Bedner P.", "AuthorID": "6506169922", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences and Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "56652556900": {"Name": "Dupper A.", "AuthorID": "56652556900", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences and Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "6506591788": {"Name": "H\u00fcttmann K.", "AuthorID": "6506591788", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences and Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "57198685468": {"Name": "M\u00fcller J.", "AuthorID": "57198685468", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences and Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "57079950100": {"Name": "Herde M.", "AuthorID": "57079950100", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences and Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "26535712100": {"Name": "Dublin P.", "AuthorID": "26535712100", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurobiology, University of D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "56652566700": {"Name": "Deshpande T.", "AuthorID": "56652566700", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences and Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "8694890100": {"Name": "Henneberger C.", "AuthorID": "8694890100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "7004592385": {"Name": "Theis M.", "AuthorID": "7004592385", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences and Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "7003584144": {"Name": "Steinh\u00e4user C.", "AuthorID": "7003584144", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Neurosciences and Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "7102968443": {"Name": "Schramm J.", "AuthorID": "7102968443", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Medical Faculty, University of Bonn"}, "21742556100": {"Name": "H\u00e4ussler U.", "AuthorID": "21742556100", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Epilepsy Research, Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Freiburg"}, "7202620446": {"Name": "Haas C.", "AuthorID": "7202620446", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Epilepsy Research, Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Freiburg"}}}
