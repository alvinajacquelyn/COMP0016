Study design: retrospective case-control study with the number of ultrasounds as the exposure and the pregnant woman's preference to give birth in a low-technology setting (midwifery-led unit or home) or a high-technology setting (obstetric unit) as the primary outcome. Sample and Setting: low-risk primigravid women receiving antenatal care at a central London academic medical centre. Measurements: antenatal ultrasound frequency; birthplace preference at the initial pregnancy appointment (T1) and at the commencement of labour (T2); demographic data including ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation, age, and body mass index. Findings: 1100 cases were reviewed. Women received an average of 4.03 ultrasounds during their pregnancy (SD=1.96, range 2-14). The frequency of ultrasounds for women who had a low-technology T2 birthplace preference was significantly lower than for those who had a high-technology T2 birthplace preference (t=2.98, df=1098, p=0.003, r=0.1), and women who had a constant low-technology birthrate preference had significantly less ultrasounds than other women (F (3,644)=3.475, p = .02). However, within a logistic regression the frequency of ultrasound was not associated with T2 birthplace preference, after controlling for T1 birthplace preference. Key conclusions: the findings of this investigation suggest that a preference made early in pregnancy is a greater predictor of birthplace preference than exposure to antenatal ultrasounds. Implications for practice: further research is required to inform interventions that would encourage low-risk pregnant women to select a low-technology place of birth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Low-risk pregnancy", "Medicalisation", "Place of birth choice", "Ultrasound frequency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Birthing Centers", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Mothers", "Nurse-Patient Relations", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Care", "Retrospective Studies", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920597777", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Maternity and Midwifery", "NURS", "2913"]], "AuthorData": {"56315079200": {"Name": "Harris J.M.", "AuthorID": "56315079200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Psychology Research Group, UCL Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}, "7005919617": {"Name": "Franck L.", "AuthorID": "7005919617", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Health Care Nursing, University of California"}, "7401825012": {"Name": "Green B.", "AuthorID": "7401825012", "AffiliationID": "107977216", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Women's Health, UCLH"}, "56471089600": {"Name": "Wilson S.", "AuthorID": "56471089600", "AffiliationID": "107977216", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Women's Health, UCLH"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, UCL"}}}
