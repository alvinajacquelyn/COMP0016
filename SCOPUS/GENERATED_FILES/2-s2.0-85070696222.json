However, whether impulsivity and compulsivity in clinical disorders is continuous with the healthy population and explains cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical dysfunction across different disorders remains unclear. Here, we characterized the relationship between cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical effective connectivity, estimated using dynamic causal modelling of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data, and dimensional phenotypes of impulsivity and compulsivity in two symptomatically distinct but phenotypically related disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder and gambling disorder. 487 online participants provided data for modelling of dimensional phenotypes. These data were combined with 34 obsessive-compulsive disorder patients, 22 gambling disorder patients, and 39 healthy controls, who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Three core dimensions were identified: disinhibition, impulsivity, and compulsivity. Patients\u2019 scores on these dimensions were continuously distributed with the healthy participants, supporting a continuum model of psychopathology. Across all participants, higher disinhibition correlated with lower bottom-up connectivity in the dorsal circuit and greater bottom-up connectivity in the ventral circuit, and higher compulsivity correlated with lower bottom-up connectivity in the dorsal circuit. In patients, higher clinical severity was also linked to lower bottom-up connectivity in the dorsal circuit, but these findings were independent of phenotypic variation, demonstrating convergence towards behaviourally and clinically relevant changes in brain dynamics. Effective connectivity did not differ as a function of traditional diagnostic labels and only weak associations were observed for functional connectivity measures. Together, our results demonstrate that cortical-striatal-thalamic-cortical dysfunction across obsessive-compulsive disorder and gambling disorder may be better characterized by dimensional phenotypes than diagnostic comparisons, supporting investigation of quantitative liability phenotypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compulsivity", "DCM", "Disinhibition", "GD", "Impulsivity", "OCD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Gambling", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Impulsive Behavior", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neural Pathways", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Phenotype", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070696222", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57188809685": {"Name": "Parkes L.", "AuthorID": "57188809685", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "The Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, and Monash Biomedical Imaging, Monash University"}, "57203279544": {"Name": "Tiego J.", "AuthorID": "57203279544", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "The Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, and Monash Biomedical Imaging, Monash University"}, "13407519300": {"Name": "Aquino K.", "AuthorID": "13407519300", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "The Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, and Monash Biomedical Imaging, Monash University"}, "57210423459": {"Name": "Braganza L.", "AuthorID": "57210423459", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60087944", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Neuropsychiatry Centre, Department of Psychiatry, The University of Melbourne and Melbourne Health"}, "55382768500": {"Name": "Fontenelle L.F.", "AuthorID": "55382768500", "AffiliationID": "60104383, 60000036", "AffiliationName": "Obsessive, Compulsive, and Anxiety Spectrum Research Program, Institute of Psychiatry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro & D'Or Institute for Research and Education"}, "25645173700": {"Name": "Lorenzetti V.", "AuthorID": "25645173700", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Faculty of Health, Australian Catholic University"}, "25031569200": {"Name": "Razi A.", "AuthorID": "25031569200", "AffiliationID": "60060302", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, NED University of Engineering and Technology"}, "15769060400": {"Name": "Fornito A.", "AuthorID": "15769060400", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "The Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, and Monash Biomedical Imaging, Monash University"}, "7006258831": {"Name": "Y\u00fccel M.", "AuthorID": "7006258831", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "The Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, and Monash Biomedical Imaging, Monash University"}, "7202135007": {"Name": "Harrison B.J.", "AuthorID": "7202135007", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60087944", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne Neuropsychiatry Centre, Department of Psychiatry, The University of Melbourne and Melbourne Health"}, "24723599200": {"Name": "Chamberlain S.R.", "AuthorID": "24723599200", "AffiliationID": "60005210, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge and Cambridge Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36060078700": {"Name": "Paton B.", "AuthorID": "36060078700", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Cognition & Philosophy Lab, Monash University"}}}
