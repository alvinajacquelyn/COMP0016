They do this by migrating from the tissues to the T cell area of the secondary lymphoid tissues. Here,wedemonstrate thatmyeloid cell-specific genetic deletion of PTP1B(LysM PTP1B) leads to defects in lipopolysaccharide-driven bone marrow-derivedDC(BMDC) activation associated with increased levels of phosphorylated Stat3.Weshowthatmyeloid cell-specific PTP1Bdeletion also causes decreased migratory capacity of epidermal DC, aswell as reduced CCR7 expression and chemotaxis to CCL19 by BMDC. PTP1B deficiency in BMDC also impairs their migration in vivo. Further, immature LysM PTP1B BMDC display fewer podosomes, increased levels of phosphorylated Src at tyrosine 527, and loss of Src localization to podosome puncta. In co-culture with T cells, LysM PTP1B BMDC establish fewer and shorter contacts than control BMDC. Finally, LysMPTP1BBMDCfail to present antigen to T cells as efficiently as controlBMDC. These data provide first evidence for a key regulatory role for PTP1B in mediating a central DC function of initiating adaptive immune responses in response to innate immune cell activation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive immune response", "Dendritic cell maturation", "Podosomes", "Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B", "T cell activation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Movement", "Cells, Cultured", "Chemokine CCL19", "Coculture Techniques", "Dendritic Cells", "Female", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Myeloid Cells", "Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 1", "Podosomes", "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 1", "Receptors, CCR7", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975735331", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"24179349300": {"Name": "Martin-Granados C.", "AuthorID": "24179349300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Cambridge"}, "57189889658": {"Name": "Le Sommer S.", "AuthorID": "57189889658", "AffiliationID": "60011032, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine"}, "16313179100": {"Name": "Klaska I.P.", "AuthorID": "16313179100", "AffiliationID": "60011032, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine"}, "57199082049": {"Name": "Yu T.", "AuthorID": "57199082049", "AffiliationID": "60011032, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine"}, "6603494215": {"Name": "Muckersie E.", "AuthorID": "6603494215", "AffiliationID": "60011032, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine"}, "12141457600": {"Name": "Giuraniuc C.V.", "AuthorID": "12141457600", "AffiliationID": "60011032, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine"}, "7102309576": {"Name": "Grant L.", "AuthorID": "7102309576", "AffiliationID": "60011032, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine"}, "6507915141": {"Name": "Delibegovic M.", "AuthorID": "6507915141", "AffiliationID": "60011032, 60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, College of Life Sciences and Medicine"}, "7201453754": {"Name": "Forrester J.V.", "AuthorID": "7201453754", "AffiliationID": "60012391", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Experimental Immunology, Lions Eye Institute"}, "7005983965": {"Name": "Prescott A.R.", "AuthorID": "7005983965", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cell Biology and Immunology, College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee"}}}
