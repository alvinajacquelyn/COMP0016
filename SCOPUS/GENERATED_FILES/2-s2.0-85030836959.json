If promptly recognised, it can usually be managed successfully with conservative methods, without long-lasting sequelae, but delayed or inappropriate management may lead to permanent neck deformity, neurological problems and pain. Method: Case review. Case report: Two children with atlanto-Axial rotatory fixation following ENT surgery; one child was referred early and managed successfully, and one had delayed referral resulting in permanent severe positional deformity. Conclusion: Atlanto-Axial rotatory fixation is easily missed; there are significant clinical and medicolegal implications if it is not promptly recognised. A suggested management algorithm is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atlanto-Axial Joint", "Iatrogenic Disease", "Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures", "Torticollis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Atlanto-Axial Joint", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Joint Dislocations", "Male", "Mastoidectomy", "Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures", "Radiography", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Torticollis", "Tympanoplasty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030836959", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"54398602100": {"Name": "James G.", "AuthorID": "54398602100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57216295405": {"Name": "Thompson D.N.P.", "AuthorID": "57216295405", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
