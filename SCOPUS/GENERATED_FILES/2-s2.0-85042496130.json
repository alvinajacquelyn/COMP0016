More specifically, in Fig. 3 they had accidentally included the instrument \u201cMeasurements in the Addictions for Triage and Evaluation\u201d in the group of measures classified as \u201cnot focussing directly on substance misuse\u201d which is incorrect, since \u201csubstance misuse\u201d is one of the domains which this instrument covers, as shown in Table 2. The corrected version of Fig. 3 is now presented below. It is also worth mentioning that the correction of this figure does not change the findings of the paper, nor has this information been presented elsewhere in the manuscript.
