We characterised the activity of putative cerebellar Purkinje cells, Golgi cells and mossy fibres in awake mice engaged in an active locomotion task, using high-density silicon electrode arrays. Analysis of the activity of over 300 neurons in response to locomotion revealed that the majority of cells (53%) were significantly modulated by phase of the stepping cycle. However, in contrast to studies involving passive locomotion on a treadmill, we found that a high proportion of cells (45%) were tuned to the speed of locomotion, and 19% were tuned to yaw movements. The activity of neurons in the cerebellar vermis provided more information about future speed of locomotion than about past or present speed, suggesting a motor, rather than purely sensory, role. We were able to accurately decode the speed of locomotion with a simple linear algorithm, with only a relatively small number of well-chosen cells needed, irrespective of cell class. Our observations suggest that behavioural state modulates cerebellar sensorimotor integration, and advocate a role for the cerebellar vermis in control of high-level locomotor kinematic parameters such as speed and yaw.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cerebellar Vermis", "Cerebellum", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Equipment Design", "Gait", "Locomotion", "Mice", "Neurons", "Psychomotor Performance", "Purkinje Cells", "User-Computer Interface", "Virtual Reality"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053283243", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56076286300": {"Name": "Muzzu T.", "AuthorID": "56076286300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57203860179": {"Name": "Mitolo S.", "AuthorID": "57203860179", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurotechnology, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57203864709": {"Name": "Gava G.P.", "AuthorID": "57203864709", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurotechnology, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "7201742078": {"Name": "Schultz S.R.", "AuthorID": "7201742078", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurotechnology, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}}}
