Main features are cardiomyopathy, myopathy and hypoglycemic encephalopathy. We report a Turkish case with a novel SLC22A5 gene mutation presented with a pure cardiac phenotype. During the 14-year follow-up study, cardiac functions were remained within a normal range with oral L-carnitine supplementation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiomyopathy", "carnitine deficiency", "novel mutation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cardiomyopathies", "Carnitine", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Hormone Replacement Therapy", "Humans", "Hyperammonemia", "Male", "Muscular Diseases", "Mutation", "Organic Cation Transport Proteins", "Turkey"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941047923", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"54999866900": {"Name": "Yilmaz B.", "AuthorID": "54999866900", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Metabolism and Nutrition"}, "56380107600": {"Name": "Kor D.", "AuthorID": "56380107600", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Metabolism and Nutrition"}, "7005565613": {"Name": "Mungan N.", "AuthorID": "7005565613", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Metabolism and Nutrition"}, "35299137500": {"Name": "Erdem S.", "AuthorID": "35299137500", "AffiliationID": "60002278", "AffiliationName": "Cukurova University Medical Faculty, Department of Pediatric Cardiology"}, "6508114123": {"Name": "Ceylaner S.", "AuthorID": "6508114123", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Intergen Genetic Laboratory, Department of Clinical Genetics"}}}
