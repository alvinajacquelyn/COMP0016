We compared the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer. Method Model based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. A decision tree model was constructed using probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources. A time horizon of 5 years was used. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Results The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the incremental net monetary benefit was positive (\u00a33,708.58 (95% confidence intervals (CI) -\u00a39,473.62 to \u00a316,115.69) but the 95% CI includes zero, indicating that there is significant uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy versus open distal pancreatectomy. The probability laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was cost-effective compared to open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer was between 70% and 80% at the willingness-to-pay thresholds generally used in England (\u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000 per QALY gained). Results were sensitive to the survival proportions and the operating time. Conclusions There is considerable uncertainty about whether laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy is cost-effective compared to open distal pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer in the NHS setting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Humans", "Length of Stay", "Pancreatectomy", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039172684", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"16301178800": {"Name": "Gurusamy K.S.", "AuthorID": "16301178800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57188742668": {"Name": "Riviere D.", "AuthorID": "57188742668", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Radboud University"}, "6603870994": {"Name": "van Laarhoven C.J.H.", "AuthorID": "6603870994", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Radboud University"}, "6603166269": {"Name": "Besselink M.", "AuthorID": "6603166269", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Academic Medical Center"}, "6603941546": {"Name": "Abu-hilal M.", "AuthorID": "6603941546", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital Southampton, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57210018355": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "57210018355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Applied Health Research, University College London"}}}
