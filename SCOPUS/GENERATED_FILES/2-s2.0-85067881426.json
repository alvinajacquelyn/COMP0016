This set of catalysts was used to investigate the effect of intracrystalline macropores on the deactivation behaviour of ZSM-5 catalysts in the conversion of methanol to olefins (MTO). The catalytic tests showed that the incorporation of macropores was very beneficial in improving the catalyst lifetime in the MTO reaction. This improved performance was correlated to the reduced coke formation during the reaction, likely a result of the enhanced transport of reactants and products in the zeolite crystals due to the well-interconnected macropores. Also worth mentioning is the effect of the dimensions of the additional macropores on the rate of coke formation. Increasing the macropore size by a factor of two led to a decrease in coke formation and consequently a two times longer catalyst lifetime.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst lifetime", "Chemical compositions", "Conversion of methanol to olefins (MTO)", "Enhanced transports", "Mesoporous silica particles", "MFI-type zeolite", "Sacrificial templates", "Textural properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067881426", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"56464262700": {"Name": "Weissenberger T.", "AuthorID": "56464262700", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Reaction Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "57209472809": {"Name": "Reiprich B.", "AuthorID": "57209472809", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Reaction Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "55523540800": {"Name": "Machoke A.", "AuthorID": "55523540800", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Reaction Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "57209478001": {"Name": "Kl\u00fchspies K.", "AuthorID": "57209478001", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Reaction Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "7005555389": {"Name": "Schwieger W.", "AuthorID": "7005555389", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Reaction Engineering, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "56213627400": {"Name": "Bauer J.", "AuthorID": "56213627400", "AffiliationID": "108857939", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Catalysts (Germany) GmbH"}, "55693081500": {"Name": "Dotzel R.", "AuthorID": "55693081500", "AffiliationID": "108857939", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Catalysts (Germany) GmbH"}, "6601959866": {"Name": "Casci J.", "AuthorID": "6601959866", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}}}
