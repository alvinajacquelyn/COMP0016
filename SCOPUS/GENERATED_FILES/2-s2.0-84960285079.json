To date, a reporter-based assay to assess the functional consequences of KAL1 mutations is lacking. We aimed to develop a luciferase assay for novel application to functional assessment of rare KAL1 mutations detected in a screen of 422 patients with SOD.Quantitative analysis was performed using L6-myoblasts stably expressing FGFR1, transfected with a luciferase-reporter vector containing elements of the FGF-responsive osteocalcin promoter.The two variants assayed [p.K185N, p.P291T], were detected in three females with SOD (presenting with optic nerve hypoplasia, midline and pituitary defects). Our novel assay revealed significant decreases in transcriptional activity [p.K185N: 21% (p < 0.01); p.P291T: 40% (p < 0.001)].Our luciferase-reporter assay, developed for assessment of KAL1 mutations, determined that two variants in females with hypopituitarism/SOD are loss-of-function; demonstrating that this assay is suitable for quantitative assessment of mutations in this gene.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Females", "KAL1", "Kallmann syndrome", "Luciferase assay", "Septo-optic dysplasia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cercopithecus aethiops", "COS Cells", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Luciferases", "Models, Molecular", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Pedigree", "Pituitary Gland", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Septo-Optic Dysplasia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960285079", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"37017580200": {"Name": "McCabe M.J.", "AuthorID": "37017580200", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60017448", "AffiliationName": "St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW Australia"}, "54079490600": {"Name": "Gregory L.C.", "AuthorID": "54079490600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "26653409200": {"Name": "Alatzoglou K.S.", "AuthorID": "26653409200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56083087300": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "56083087300", "AffiliationID": "60102447", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology, Nanjing Medical University First Affiliated Hospital, Jiangsu Province Hospital"}, "8783057300": {"Name": "Bouloux P.M.", "AuthorID": "8783057300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroendocrinology, Royal Free Hospital and University College Medical School, University College London"}, "8578913500": {"Name": "Gaston-Massuet C.", "AuthorID": "8578913500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "6603565499": {"Name": "Martinez-Barbera J.P.", "AuthorID": "6603565499", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neural Development Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56835320100": {"Name": "Gualtieri A.", "AuthorID": "56835320100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}, "7007078986": {"Name": "Saldanha J.W.", "AuthorID": "7007078986", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Division of Mathematical Biology, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "35785105300": {"Name": "Thankamony A.", "AuthorID": "35785105300", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hospital"}, "56365856800": {"Name": "Hughes I.", "AuthorID": "56365856800", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Addenbrookes Hospital"}, "16687227900": {"Name": "Townshend S.", "AuthorID": "16687227900", "AffiliationID": "60022486", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Hospital for Children"}}}
