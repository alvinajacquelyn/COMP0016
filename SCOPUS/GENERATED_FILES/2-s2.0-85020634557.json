Asian Society of Gynecologic Oncology, Korean Society of Gynecologic Oncology.There has been significant progress in the understanding of the pathology and molecular biology of rare ovarian cancers, which has helped both diagnosis and treatment. This paper provides an update on recent advances in the knowledge and treatment of rare ovarian cancers and identifies gaps that need to be addressed by further clinical research. The topics covered include: low-grade serous, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas of the ovary. Given the molecular heterogeneity and the histopathological rarity of these ovarian cancers, the importance of designing adequately powered trials or finding statistically innovative ways to approach the treatment of these rare tumors has been emphasized. This paper is based on the Rare Ovarian Tumors Conference for Young Investigators which was presented in Tokyo 2015 prior to the 5th Ovarian Cancer Consensus Conference of the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ovarian Neoplasms", "Rare Diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell", "Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Congresses as Topic", "Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures", "Female", "Fertility Preservation", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Ovariectomy", "Rare Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020634557", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57194537284": {"Name": "Jang J.Y.A.", "AuthorID": "57194537284", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "8696702400": {"Name": "Yanaihara N.", "AuthorID": "8696702400", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "57220732509": {"Name": "Kuroda T.", "AuthorID": "57220732509", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "57190577335": {"Name": "Nagayoshi Y.", "AuthorID": "57190577335", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "26423785400": {"Name": "Kawabata A.", "AuthorID": "26423785400", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "8436029100": {"Name": "Iida Y.", "AuthorID": "8436029100", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "7201644103": {"Name": "Okamoto A.", "AuthorID": "7201644103", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "7005035415": {"Name": "Pujade-Lauraine E.", "AuthorID": "7005035415", "AffiliationID": "60029621, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 Cancer de la Femme et Recherche Clinique, H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Site H\u00f4tel-Dieu, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "15745652200": {"Name": "Mikami Y.", "AuthorID": "15745652200", "AffiliationID": "60019431", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic Pathology, Kumamoto University Hospital"}, "7402162380": {"Name": "Oda K.", "AuthorID": "7402162380", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo"}, "7005651467": {"Name": "Bookman M.", "AuthorID": "7005651467", "AffiliationID": "116657943", "AffiliationName": "US Oncology Research and Arizona Oncology"}, "7007134127": {"Name": "Ledermann J.", "AuthorID": "7007134127", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7403072424": {"Name": "Shimada M.", "AuthorID": "7403072424", "AffiliationID": "60024351", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tottori University School of Medicine"}, "7006838884": {"Name": "Kiyokawa T.", "AuthorID": "7006838884", "AffiliationID": "60031615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, The Jikei University School of Medicine"}, "17233649700": {"Name": "Kim B.G.", "AuthorID": "17233649700", "AffiliationID": "60016329, 60020857", "AffiliationName": "Gynecologic Cancer Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine"}, "7102991357": {"Name": "Matsumura N.", "AuthorID": "7102991357", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kyoto University"}, "7101877808": {"Name": "Kaku T.", "AuthorID": "7101877808", "AffiliationID": "60185923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyushu University"}, "56727018500": {"Name": "Kim J.W.", "AuthorID": "56727018500", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Seoul National University"}, "57200242435": {"Name": "Quinn M.", "AuthorID": "57200242435", "AffiliationID": "60032679", "AffiliationName": "Women's Cancer Research Center, Royal Women's Hospital"}}}
