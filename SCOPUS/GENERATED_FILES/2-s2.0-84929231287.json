Following nerve injury, upregulation of the \u03b12\u03b4-1 subunit in sensory dorsal root ganglion neurons contributes to the generation of chronic pain states; however, very little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Here we show that the increased expression of \u03b12\u03b4-1 in rat sensory neurons leads to prolonged Ca2+ responses evoked by membrane depolarization. This mechanism is coupled to CaV2.2 channel-mediated responses, as it is blocked by a \u03c9-conotoxin GVIA application. Once initiated, the prolonged Ca2+ transients are not dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and do not require Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum. The selective inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake demonstrates that \u03b12\u03b4-1-mediated prolonged Ca2+ signals are buffered by mitochondria, preferentially activated by Ca2+ influx through CaV2.2 channels. Thus, by controlling channel abundance at the plasma membrane, the \u03b12\u03b4-1 subunit has a major impact on the organization of depolarization-induced intracellular Ca2+ signaling in dorsal root ganglion neurons.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Antimycin A", "Calcium", "Calcium Channel Blockers", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Calcium Signaling", "Cells, Cultured", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Female", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Indoles", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Nifedipine", "omega-Conotoxin GVIA", "Potassium Chloride", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Tubulin", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929231287", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56642720400": {"Name": "D\u2019Arco M.", "AuthorID": "56642720400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "6507650153": {"Name": "Margas W.", "AuthorID": "6507650153", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56208947800": {"Name": "Cassidy J.", "AuthorID": "56208947800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "24498942300": {"Name": "Dolphin A.", "AuthorID": "24498942300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
