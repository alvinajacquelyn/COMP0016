Stem cell transplantation offers the opportunity of cure for all these complications, and over the past 35 years there has been a remarkable improvement in survival following this treatment. Here, we review advances in management of clinical complications pre-and post-transplant, as well as discuss the morbidity Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome patients experience following treatment. For patients with a poorly matched stem cell donor, recent gene therapy trials demonstrate encouraging results and the potential of low-toxicity therapy for all patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation", "autoimmunity", "gene therapy", "primary immunodeficiency", "thrombocytopenia", "Wiskott Aldrich syndrome", "Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein", "X-linked thrombocytopenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child, Preschool", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Therapy", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Infant", "Mutation", "Survival Analysis", "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome", "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939604953", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"12786401200": {"Name": "Worth A.J.", "AuthorID": "12786401200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hospital National Health Service Trust"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
