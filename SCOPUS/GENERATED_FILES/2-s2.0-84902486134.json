However the social learning processes that may explain both the similarities and differences between the species remain unclear. A previous study of nut-cracking by initially na\u00efve chimpanzees suggested that a learning chimpanzee holding no hammer nevertheless replicated hammering actions it witnessed. This observation has potentially important implications for the nature of the social learning processes and underlying motor coding involved. In the present study, model and observer actions were quantified frame-by-frame and analysed with stringent statistical methods, demonstrating synchrony between the observer's and model's movements, cross-correlation of these movements above chance level and a unidirectional transmission process from model to observer. These results provide the first quantitative evidence for motor mimicking underlain by motor coding in apes, with implications for mirror neuron function.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Female", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Learning", "Male", "Monte Carlo Method", "Motor Skills", "Pan troglodytes", "Tool Use Behavior", "Videotape Recording"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84902486134", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56205456800": {"Name": "Fuhrmann D.", "AuthorID": "56205456800", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Psychology and Language Science, University College London"}, "23467537600": {"Name": "Marshall-Pescini S.", "AuthorID": "23467537600", "AffiliationID": "60003417", "AffiliationName": "Comparative Cognition, Messerli Research Institute, University of Veterinary Medicine"}, "7004657792": {"Name": "Whiten A.", "AuthorID": "7004657792", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Social Learning and Cognitive Evolution, School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}, "55816178200": {"Name": "Ravignani A.", "AuthorID": "55816178200", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Biology, University of Vienna"}}}
