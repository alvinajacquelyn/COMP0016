We review his influence on students and colleagues not only at Cambridge and Bergen Universities, his places of primary employment, but also on individuals and research groups in Europe and North America. We also introduce the collection of papers that we have assembled in his honour. The papers are written by his former students and close colleagues and span many of the areas of palaeoecology to which John himself has made major contributions. These include the relationship between ecology and palaeoecology, late-glacial and Holocene palaeoecology, ecological succession, climate change and vegetation history, the role of palaeoecological techniques in reconstructing and understanding the impact of human activity on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems and numerical analysis of multivariate palaeoecological data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Ecosystem history", "Holocene", "Late-glacial", "Numerical data analysis", "Palaeoecology", "Palaeolimnology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918510645", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"7004478225": {"Name": "Battarbee R.W.", "AuthorID": "7004478225", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7103263371": {"Name": "Lamb H.", "AuthorID": "7103263371", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Aberystwyth University"}, "7202750287": {"Name": "Bennett K.", "AuthorID": "7202750287", "AffiliationID": "124989073", "AffiliationName": "Queen\u2019s University"}, "7402846040": {"Name": "Edwards M.", "AuthorID": "7402846040", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "6603306776": {"Name": "Bjune A.E.", "AuthorID": "6603306776", "AffiliationID": "113886182", "AffiliationName": "Uni Research Climate"}, "6507328402": {"Name": "Kaland P.E.", "AuthorID": "6507328402", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "University of Bergen"}, "57203056321": {"Name": "Willis K.J.", "AuthorID": "57203056321", "AffiliationID": "60000345", "AffiliationName": "Royal Botanic Gardens Kew"}, "7004460067": {"Name": "Birks H.H.", "AuthorID": "7004460067", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "University of Bergen"}, "7102216551": {"Name": "Berglund B.E.", "AuthorID": "7102216551", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "University of Lund"}, "56271092400": {"Name": "Lotter A.F.", "AuthorID": "56271092400", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht University"}, "55450457900": {"Name": "Sepp\u00e4 H.", "AuthorID": "55450457900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "University of Helsinki"}, "8613967400": {"Name": "Herzschuh U.", "AuthorID": "8613967400", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research, Research Unit Potsdam"}}}
