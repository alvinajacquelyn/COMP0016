The condition is rare, can result in preterm delivery, and can mimic hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Thus, suspicion of the diagnosis, appropriate investigations, and therapeutic trials with pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate are often delayed. In this paper we report four cases of pyridox(am)ine 5\u2032-phosphate oxidase deficiency, two of whom are siblings. Three were treated with pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate in the first few days of life and the fourth within the first month. One of the siblings was electively treated from birth until a diagnosis was secured. Our cases demonstrate that early diagnosis and treatment can be associated with normal neurodevelopment in childhood. We suggest that a low threshold for investigating for pyridox(am)ine 5\u2032-phosphate oxidase deficiency and electively treating with pyridoxal-5\u2032-phosphate is considered in any neonate with encephalopathy, including those with presumed hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in whom the degree of encephalopathy is not expected from perinatal history, cord gases and/or neuroimaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biotinidase deficiency", "Breakthrough seizure", "Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy", "Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy", "Neonatal encephalopathy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996467462", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"]], "AuthorData": {"57200539063": {"Name": "Hatch J.", "AuthorID": "57200539063", "AffiliationID": "60026132", "AffiliationName": "Uniting Care Health Clinical School, The Wesley Hospital"}, "16834669700": {"Name": "Coman D.", "AuthorID": "16834669700", "AffiliationID": "60032987, 60190626", "AffiliationName": "The School of Medicine, Griffith University"}, "55897134500": {"Name": "Riney K.", "AuthorID": "55897134500", "AffiliationID": "60138490", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, The Lady Cilento Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "24281063100": {"Name": "Calvert S.", "AuthorID": "24281063100", "AffiliationID": "60138490", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, The Lady Cilento Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57202556029": {"Name": "Mills P.", "AuthorID": "57202556029", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7402927699": {"Name": "Webster R.I.", "AuthorID": "7402927699", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Medical School, The University of Sydney"}}}
