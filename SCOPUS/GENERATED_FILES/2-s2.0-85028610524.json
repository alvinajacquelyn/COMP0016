Internationally, approaches to river restoration are increasingly incorporating large wood features, but generally favour simple flow deflectors (e.g. single logs, stripped of branches and anchored in place) over more complex structures that more accurately mimic natural wood jams. This paper explores channel response to wood-based restoration of an overwidened lowland chalk stream that incorporated whole felled trees. Hydraulics, sediment, topography and vegetation data were assessed for a 3 year period for two restored reaches: an upstream reach where pre-restoration baseline data were obtained, and a downstream reach restored before data collection. Where pre-restoration data were available, the introduction of wood jams generated sediment deposition within jams leading to the development of vegetated marginal \u2018benches\u2019 and bed scour in adjacent areas of flow convergence. Patterns were less clear in the downstream reach, where restoration design was less ambitious and outcomes may have been affected by subsequent restoration work upstream. The results indicate that reintroduction of large wood (whole trees), can promote channel and habitat recovery from overwidening in lowland rivers, creating important ecological benefits through the provision of structurally complex marginal habitat and associated food resources. Longer-term assessments are required to establish whether the trajectories of change are persistent. The work emphasizes the effectiveness of restoration approaches that aim to \u2018work with nature\u2019. The ambitious design, incorporating structurally complex wood jams, was also low-cost, using materials available from the river corridor (existing riparian trees). Furthermore, ecosystem engineering effects were amplified by the colonization of wood jams by aquatic vegetation. The approach should, therefore, be transferable to other lowland rivers, subject to wider catchment constraints.", "AuthorKeywords": ["catchment management", "restoration", "river", "stream", "vegetation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028610524", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"25821590000": {"Name": "Harvey G.", "AuthorID": "25821590000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Queen Mary University of London"}, "46062022700": {"Name": "Henshaw A.", "AuthorID": "46062022700", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35269469400": {"Name": "Parker C.", "AuthorID": "35269469400", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environmental Management, University of the West of England"}, "7003314493": {"Name": "Sayer C.", "AuthorID": "7003314493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
