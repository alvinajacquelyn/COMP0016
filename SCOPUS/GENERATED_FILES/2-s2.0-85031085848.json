All rights reserved.In this article, we introduce our linear-scaling first-principles calculation code CONQUEST, which enables us to carry out density functional theory (DFT) calculations on very large systems, of up to millions of atoms. The code uses localized basis sets and linear-scaling (or O(N)) methods, and has high parallel efficiency on large supercomputers like the K computer in Kobe. The code should be a powerful tool for the study of structural and physical properties of materials in the earth\u2019s deep interior, and the prospects for this application are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Constant-pressure molecular dynamics", "Density functional theory (DFT)", "First-principles molecular dynamics", "Linear-scaling or O(N) methods", "Parallel efficiency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031085848", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56052137500": {"Name": "Miyazaki T.", "AuthorID": "56052137500", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}}}
