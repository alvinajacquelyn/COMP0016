If these principles were used in other settings, better clinical care may result. This before-after study sought to establish whether a short multidisciplinary training intervention can improve recognition of the deteriorating patient using an aggregated physiological parameter scoring system (Early Warning Score [EWS]). Nursing, medical, and allied nursing staff participated in an hour-long training session, using real-life scenarios with simple tools and structured debriefing. After training, staff were more likely to calculate EWS scores correctly (68.02% vs 55.12%; risk ratio [RR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07-1.44), and observations were more likely to be performed at the correct frequency (78.57% vs 68.09%; RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.09-1.32). Multidisciplinary training, according to core principles, can lead to more accurate identification of deteriorating patients, with implications for subsequent care and outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early Warning Score", "multiprofessional training", "simulation", "teamwork training"], "IndexKeywords": ["Controlled Before-After Studies", "Critical Care", "Critical Illness", "Humans", "Inservice Training", "Interdisciplinary Communication", "Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)", "Patient Care Team", "Quality Improvement", "Vital Signs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994353652", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"56507423500": {"Name": "Merriel A.", "AuthorID": "56507423500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}, "56610786300": {"Name": "van der Nelson H.", "AuthorID": "56610786300", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "North Bristol Trust"}, "57193304838": {"Name": "Merriel S.", "AuthorID": "57193304838", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "57202408983": {"Name": "Draycott T.", "AuthorID": "57202408983", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "North Bristol Trust"}, "12040807900": {"Name": "Siassakos D.", "AuthorID": "12040807900", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "North Bristol Trust"}, "55388609400": {"Name": "Bennett J.", "AuthorID": "55388609400", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "North Bristol Trust"}, "6603708284": {"Name": "Donald F.", "AuthorID": "6603708284", "AffiliationID": "60027676", "AffiliationName": "North Bristol Trust"}}}
