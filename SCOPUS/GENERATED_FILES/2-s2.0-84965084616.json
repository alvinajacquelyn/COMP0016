A promising avenue may be manipulating thymosin-\u03b24, a naturally occurring peptide, which is the major G-actin sequestering protein in mammalian cells and a regulator of inflammation and fibrosis. Thymosin-\u03b24 is already being tested in clinical trials for heart disease and wound healing. This editorial outlines the evidence that thymosin-\u03b24 may also have therapeutic benefit in CKD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ac-SDKP", "Fibrosis", "Inflammation", "Kidney disease", "Thymosin-\u03b24"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Kidney", "Mice", "Rats", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Thymosin", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965084616", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"25925539800": {"Name": "Vasilopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "25925539800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Developmental Biology and Cancer"}, "7005108338": {"Name": "Winyard P.", "AuthorID": "7005108338", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Developmental Biology and Cancer"}, "26643015300": {"Name": "Long D.", "AuthorID": "26643015300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Developmental Biology and Cancer"}, "57194786909": {"Name": "Riley P.", "AuthorID": "57194786909", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics"}}}
