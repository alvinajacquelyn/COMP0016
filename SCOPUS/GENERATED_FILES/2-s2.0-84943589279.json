Where an emissions tax is the only available instrument, policy faces a trade-off between the incentive to invest in abatement technology and efficiency in subsequent output decisions. More efficient outcomes can be achieved by supplementing the emissions tax with direct regulation of abatement technology, or by combining the tax with an abatement technology investment subsidy. We compare the properties of these alternative instrument combinations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Externalities", "Pigouvian taxes", "Regulation", "Subsidies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abatement costs", "Abatement technologies", "Emissions tax", "Externalities", "Marginal abatement costs", "Pigouvian taxes", "Regulation", "Subsidies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943589279", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"17433617200": {"Name": "Christiansen V.", "AuthorID": "17433617200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Oslo"}, "57212961625": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57212961625", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}}}
