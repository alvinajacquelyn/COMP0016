Utilising self-reported surveys, the article explores the potential impact that environmental volunteering has on people's pro-environmental behaviours over time, using The Conservation Volunteers' two volunteering programmes - Green Gyms\u00ae and Action Teams - as a comparative case study. The findings show a positive association between environmental volunteering activities and a person's self-reported pro-environmental behaviours over time. Further, volunteers presented improved impact across almost all of the eight pro-environmental behaviours measured, with differences observed between the two volunteering programmes as well as sociodemographic groupings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Environmental volunteering", "Impact measurement", "Online survey", "Pro-environmental behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047602589", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"57191156709": {"Name": "Seymour V.", "AuthorID": "57191156709", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57202255939": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "57202255939", "AffiliationID": "120750203", "AffiliationName": "Resources for Change"}, "57202248071": {"Name": "Antonaci R.", "AuthorID": "57202248071", "AffiliationID": "120750351", "AffiliationName": "Conservation Volunteers"}}}
