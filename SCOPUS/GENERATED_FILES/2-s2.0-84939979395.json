Globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3), a deacylated form of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), has emerged as a marker of Fabry disease. We investigated the link between Gb3, lyso-Gb3 and pain. Plantar administration of lyso-Gb3 or Gb3 caused mechanical allodynia in healthy mice. In vitro application of 100nM lyso-Gb3 caused uptake of extracellular calcium in 10% of sensory neurons expressing nociceptor markers, rising to 40% of neurons at 1\u03bcM, a concentration that may occur in Fabry disease patients. Peak current densities of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels were substantially enhanced by application of 1\u03bcM lyso-Gb3. These studies suggest a direct role for lyso-Gb3 in the sensitisation of peripheral nociceptive neurons that may provide an opportunity for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of Fabry disease-associated pain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium imaging", "Dorsal root ganglia", "Fabry disease", "Pain", "Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels", "Cells, Cultured", "Fabry Disease", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Glycolipids", "Hyperalgesia", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nociceptors", "Pain", "Physical Stimulation", "Sphingolipids", "Touch", "Trihexosylceramides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939979395", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56527955200": {"Name": "Choi L.", "AuthorID": "56527955200", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "12786547200": {"Name": "Vernon J.", "AuthorID": "12786547200", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "12139633200": {"Name": "Kopach O.", "AuthorID": "12139633200", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "54785022300": {"Name": "Minett M.S.", "AuthorID": "54785022300", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Nociception Group, Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "7202875406": {"Name": "Mills K.", "AuthorID": "7202875406", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biochemistry Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.T.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biochemistry Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55947133900": {"Name": "Meert T.", "AuthorID": "55947133900", "AffiliationID": "60068574", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Pharmaceutica"}, "7404353149": {"Name": "Wood J.N.", "AuthorID": "7404353149", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "BK21 Programme, Department of Molecular Medicine, Seoul National University"}}}
