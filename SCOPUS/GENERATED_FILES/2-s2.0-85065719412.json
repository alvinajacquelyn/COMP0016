The morphological and spectroscopic analyses have confirmed successful incorporation of HE into the polymer matrix, which affected films\u2019 structure and visual appearance. The presence of HE has caused a reduction in the hydrophilic character of films, but also provided a complete UV light blockage at wavelengths below 350 nm. Furthermore, a declining trend of tensile strength (from 14.4 MPa to 6.4 MPa) and Young's modulus (from 218.8 MPa to 26.9 MPa), as well as an ascending trend of elongation at break (from 10.7% to 35.1%), have been observed after the extract incorporation. The total phenolic content in the films was up to \u223c13 mgGAE gfilm \u22121. Besides, the HE-loaded films exhibited antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogen Bacillus subtilis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibacterial packaging", "Chitosan-based films", "Film characterization", "Supercritical CO2 hop extract"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-bacterial activity", "Antibacterial packaging", "Antibacterial properties", "Elongation at break", "Film characterizations", "Food-borne pathogens", "Supercritical CO2", "Total phenolic content", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacillus subtilis", "Biocompatible Materials", "Carbon Dioxide", "Chitosan", "Elastic Modulus", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Plant Extracts", "Tensile Strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065719412", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57191985055": {"Name": "Baji\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57191985055", "AffiliationID": "60008358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Catalysis and Chemical Reaction Engineering, National Institute of Chemistry"}, "54949721600": {"Name": "Novak U.", "AuthorID": "54949721600", "AffiliationID": "60008358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Catalysis and Chemical Reaction Engineering, National Institute of Chemistry"}, "15080792600": {"Name": "Likozar B.", "AuthorID": "15080792600", "AffiliationID": "60008358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Catalysis and Chemical Reaction Engineering, National Institute of Chemistry"}, "57208751518": {"Name": "Jal\u0161ovec H.", "AuthorID": "57208751518", "AffiliationID": "60113003", "AffiliationName": "Acies Bio d.o.o."}, "26431655000": {"Name": "Travan A.", "AuthorID": "26431655000", "AffiliationID": "122216883", "AffiliationName": "Biopolife s.r.l."}}}
