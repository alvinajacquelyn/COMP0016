This common and often severe complication of intraocular inflammation led to the inclusion of uveitic glaucoma as a separate entity in the first modern classification of secondary glaucomas by Priestly Smith in 1891 [50]. Numerous eponymous uveitic syndromes associated with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) have since been described, including Fuchs heterochromic cyclitis (FHC) in 1906 [25] and Posner-Schlossman syndrome in 1948 [45].", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958873495", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6508150412": {"Name": "Sarodia U.", "AuthorID": "6508150412", "AffiliationID": "60007974", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Leicester Royal Infirmary"}, "24766175000": {"Name": "Kulkarni A.", "AuthorID": "24766175000", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
