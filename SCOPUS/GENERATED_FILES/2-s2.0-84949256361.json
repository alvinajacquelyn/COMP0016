People with dementia are a key group affected by this change in England of adult social care. We interviewed nine social care practitioners and seven Suitable People for people with dementia across five English local authorities to begin to examine their experiences of this new method of social care provision. Findings from thematic analyses suggest positive outcomes and multiple beneficiaries, but some challenges: potentially inappropriate processes, support planning, divergence in attitudes towards care and support outcomes. Implications for practice include obfuscation of recipients\u2019 and Suitable People\u2019s best interests and supporting practitioners to explore fully clients\u2019 aspirations for care and support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dementia", "indirect payments", "mental capacity", "personalisation", "social care", "Suitable Person"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Caregivers", "Dementia", "England", "Family", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Mental Competency", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949256361", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"23477379100": {"Name": "Laybourne A.", "AuthorID": "23477379100", "AffiliationID": "101036715", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Foundation"}, "23475702800": {"Name": "Williamson T.", "AuthorID": "23475702800", "AffiliationID": "101036715", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Foundation"}, "16246148900": {"Name": "Robotham D.", "AuthorID": "16246148900", "AffiliationID": "101036715", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Foundation"}, "9633404500": {"Name": "Cyhlarova E.", "AuthorID": "9633404500", "AffiliationID": "101036715", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Foundation"}, "55444651600": {"Name": "Jepson M.", "AuthorID": "55444651600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Norah Fry Research Centre, University of Bristol"}, "57189229161": {"Name": "Williams V.", "AuthorID": "57189229161", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Norah Fry Research Centre, University of Bristol"}}}
