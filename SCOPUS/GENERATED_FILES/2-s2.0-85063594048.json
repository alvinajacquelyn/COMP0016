Accurate and precise reconstructions of its concentration through geological time are therefore crucial to our understanding of the Earth system. Ice core records document pCO2 for the past 800 kyr, but at no point during this interval were CO2 levels higher than today. Interpretation of older pCO2 has been hampered by discrepancies during some time intervals between two of the main ocean-based proxy methods used to reconstruct pCO2: the carbon isotope fractionation that occurs during photosynthesis as recorded by haptophyte biomarkers (alkenones) and the boron isotope composition (\u03b411B) of foraminifer shells. Here, we present alkenone and \u03b411B-based pCO2 reconstructions generated from the same samples from the Pliocene and across a Pleistocene glacial- interglacial cycle at Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 999. We find a muted response to pCO2 in the alkenone record compared to contemporaneous ice core and \u03b411B records, suggesting caution in the interpretation of alkenone-based records at low pCO2 levels. This is possibly caused by the physiology of CO2 uptake in the haptophytes. Our new understanding resolves some of the inconsistencies between the proxies and highlights that caution may be required when interpreting alkenone-based reconstructions of pCO2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063594048", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"55661522400": {"Name": "Badger M.P.S.", "AuthorID": "55661522400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Organic Geochemistry Unit, School of Chemistry, School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "8353426200": {"Name": "Sexton P.F.", "AuthorID": "8353426200", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment, Earth and Ecosystem Sciences, Open University"}, "35273009200": {"Name": "Pancost R.D.", "AuthorID": "35273009200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Cabot Institute, University of Bristol"}, "10939039700": {"Name": "Chalk T.B.", "AuthorID": "10939039700", "AffiliationID": "60013609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Oceanography, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution"}, "7403211753": {"Name": "Foster G.L.", "AuthorID": "7403211753", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "School of Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton"}, "7103263763": {"Name": "Gibbs S.J.", "AuthorID": "7103263763", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "School of Ocean and Earth Science, National Oceanography Centre Southampton, University of Southampton"}, "6701346236": {"Name": "Bown P.R.", "AuthorID": "6701346236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "35485552700": {"Name": "Schmidt D.N.", "AuthorID": "35485552700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Cabot Institute, University of Bristol"}, "55891718300": {"Name": "P\u00e4like H.", "AuthorID": "55891718300", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen"}, "21645949500": {"Name": "Mackensen A.", "AuthorID": "21645949500", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research"}}}
