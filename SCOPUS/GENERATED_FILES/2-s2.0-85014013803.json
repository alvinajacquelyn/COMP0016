The endogenous secretion of glucocorticoids is normally characterized by a prominent and robust circadian (around 24 hours) oscillation, with a daily peak around the time of the habitual sleep-wake transition and minimal levels in the evening and early part of the night. It has long been recognized that this 24-hour rhythm partly reflects the activity of a master circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. In the past decade, secondary circadian clocks based on the same molecular machinery as the central master pacemaker were found in other brain areas as well as in most peripheral tissues, including the adrenal glands. Evidence is rapidly accumulating to indicate that misalignment between central and peripheral clocks has a host of adverse effects. The robust rhythm in circulating glucocorticoid levels has been recognized as a major internal synchronizer of the circadian system. The present review examines the scientific foundation of these novel advances and their implications for health and disease prevention and treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Circadian Clocks", "Circadian Rhythm", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014013803", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57204274028": {"Name": "Oster H.", "AuthorID": "57204274028", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Medical Department I, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "7004924445": {"Name": "Ott V.", "AuthorID": "7004924445", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Medical Department I, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "7004640781": {"Name": "Challet E.", "AuthorID": "7004640781", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60157969, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cellular and Integrative Neuroscience, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) UPR 3212, University of Strasbourg"}, "35431153700": {"Name": "Arvat E.", "AuthorID": "35431153700", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, Diabetology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Turin"}, "35476645100": {"Name": "de Kloet E.R.", "AuthorID": "35476645100", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology and Metabolic Disease, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7007018167": {"Name": "Dijk D.J.", "AuthorID": "7007018167", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Surrey Sleep Research Center, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "36067479700": {"Name": "Lightman S.", "AuthorID": "36067479700", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology, University of Bristol"}, "7006131544": {"Name": "Vgontzas A.", "AuthorID": "7006131544", "AffiliationID": "60027671", "AffiliationName": "Sleep Research and Treatment Center, Department of Psychiatry, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine"}, "7004866563": {"Name": "Van Cauter E.", "AuthorID": "7004866563", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "Sleep, Metabolism, and Health Center, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago"}}}
