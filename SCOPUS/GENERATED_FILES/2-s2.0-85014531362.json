Methods: 7058 participants from a prospective population-based cohort provided data on externality, social communication, and emotion perception between 7 and 16 years and psychotic experiences and depressive symptoms at 12 and 18 years. Bivariate probit modelling was used to investigate associations between these risk factors and psychopathological outcomes. Results: Externality was associated with psychopathology at 12 (psychotic experiences OR 1.23 95% CI 1.14, 1.33; depression OR 1.12 95% CI 1.02, 1.22) and 18 years (psychotic experiences OR 1.38 95% CI 1.23, 1.55; depression OR 1.40 95% CI 1.28, 1.52). Poor social communication was associated with depression at both ages (12 years OR 1.22 95% CI 1.11, 1.34; 18 years OR 1.21 95% CI 1.10, 1.33) and marginally associated with psychotic experiences. There was marginal evidence of a larger association between externality and psychotic experiences at 12 years (p = 0.06) and between social communication and depression at 12 years (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Externality was more strongly associated with psychotic experiences. At 18 years change in externality, between 8 and 16 years were associated with a larger increase in the risk of depression. Poor social communication was more strongly associated with depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALSPAC", "Depressive symptoms", "Psychotic experiences", "Social communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Cognition", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Internal-External Control", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Psychopathology", "Psychotic Disorders", "Risk Factors", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014531362", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"24069481600": {"Name": "Sullivan S.A.", "AuthorID": "24069481600", "AffiliationID": "115873757", "AffiliationName": "CLAHRC West"}, "7801382253": {"Name": "Kounali D.", "AuthorID": "7801382253", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, University of Bristol"}, "6603745740": {"Name": "Zammit S.", "AuthorID": "6603745740", "AffiliationID": "60103683, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cardiff, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "35747569500": {"Name": "Thompson A.", "AuthorID": "35747569500", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
