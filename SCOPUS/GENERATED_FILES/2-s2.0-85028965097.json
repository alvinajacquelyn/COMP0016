It is well established that both are characterised pathologically by widespread cortical Lewy body deposition. However, until recently, the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to neuronal damage were not known. It was also not understood why some cells are particularly vulnerable in PDD/DLB, nor why some individuals show more aggressive and rapid dementia than others. Recent studies using animal and cell models as well as human post-mortem analyses have provided important insights into these questions. Here, we review recent developments in the pathophysiology in PDD/DLB. Specifically, we examine the role of pathological proteins other than \u03b1-synuclein, consider particular morphological and physiological features that confer vulnerabilities on some neurons rather than others, and finally examine genetic factors that may explain some of the heterogeneity between individuals with PDD/DLB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DLB", "Dmentia with Lewy Bodies", "Neurodegeneration", "Parkinson's disease dimentia", "PDD"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028965097", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"16246994600": {"Name": "Weil R.", "AuthorID": "16246994600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57200436456": {"Name": "Bras J.", "AuthorID": "57200436456", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602721075": {"Name": "Lashley T.", "AuthorID": "6602721075", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55802371060": {"Name": "Schrag A.", "AuthorID": "55802371060", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
