The condition can be associated with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS), which in turn may predispose the affected patient to the development of malignant lymphoma. BLLs arising in the intraoral minor salivary glands are rare; such a lesion should prompt the work-up for SS. In some instances, a BLL of a minor salivary gland could represent the initial stage of a mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. A case of BLL arising in the palatal minor salivary glands is reported here. The importance of an appropriate diagnostic work-up is emphasized and the relationship of BLL with SS is reinforced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hard palate", "minor salivary glands", "Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone", "Middle Aged", "Palate", "Salivary Glands, Minor", "Sjogren's Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994432310", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"46561287700": {"Name": "Medeiros R.", "AuthorID": "46561287700", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Oral Medicine Unit, Department of Clinical and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "7003789865": {"Name": "Le\u00e3o J.", "AuthorID": "7003789865", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Oral Medicine Unit, Department of Clinical and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "24468212200": {"Name": "Gueiros L.", "AuthorID": "24468212200", "AffiliationID": "60031482", "AffiliationName": "Oral Medicine Unit, Department of Clinical and Preventive Dentistry, Federal University of Pernambuco"}, "7006200042": {"Name": "de Almeida O.", "AuthorID": "7006200042", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Oral Pathology Laboratory, Department of Oral Diagnosis, Piracicaba Dental School, Campinas State University"}}}
