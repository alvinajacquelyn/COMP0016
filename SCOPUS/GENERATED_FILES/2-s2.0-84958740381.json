To gain further insights into the etiology of DLBCL and to discover potential disease-related factors, we performed a serum lipid analysis on a subset of individuals from a population-based NHL case-control study. An untargeted mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics platform was used to analyze serum samples from 100 DLBCL patients and 100 healthy matched controls. Significantly elevated levels of the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), were detected in the serum of DLBCL patients (121%, P<0.05). In the male controls, elevated 2-AG levels were observed in those who were overweight (BMI =25 - <30 kg/m2; 108%, P<0.01) and obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m2; 118%, P<0.001) compared to those with a BMI <25 kg/m2. DLBCL cell lines treated with exogenous 2-AG across a range of concentrations, exhibited heterogenous responses: proliferation rates were markedly higher in 4 cell lines by 22%-68% (P<0.001) and lower in 8 by 20%-75% (P<0.001). The combined findings of elevated 2-AG levels in DLBCL patients and the proliferative effects of 2-AG on a subset of DLBCL cell lines suggests that 2-AG may play a potential role in the pathogenesis or progression of a subset of DLBCLs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2-AG", "DLBCL", "Endocannabinoids", "Lymphoma", "Obesity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958740381", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55945685700": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "55945685700", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "8695482400": {"Name": "Conde L.", "AuthorID": "8695482400", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "6701609238": {"Name": "Riby J.", "AuthorID": "6701609238", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "57201140654": {"Name": "Skibola C.F.", "AuthorID": "57201140654", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "24554388900": {"Name": "Medina-Cleghorn D.", "AuthorID": "24554388900", "AffiliationID": "60121354, 60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California at Berkeley"}, "6603891118": {"Name": "Nomura D.K.", "AuthorID": "6603891118", "AffiliationID": "60121354, 60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutritional Sciences and Toxicology, University of California at Berkeley"}, "57216753010": {"Name": "Bernal-Mizrachi L.", "AuthorID": "57216753010", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University"}, "6603636147": {"Name": "Bracci P.M.", "AuthorID": "6603636147", "AffiliationID": "60031970, 60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Medicine, University of California at San Francisco"}, "35551340400": {"Name": "Hubbard A.", "AuthorID": "35551340400", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Division of Biostatistics, University of California at Berkeley"}}}
