In itself the art piece is an example of \u2018regenring\u2019 in that it re-presents information that has previously been produced in other genres (scientific papers, mathematical formulae) by producing it using a different genre: a mixed media collaged picture displayed on a wall. In keeping with the theme of transformation and change, the article uses four different genres in discussing the piece: account of what is observed, interview with the maker of the piece, reflection-in-action shown in italics and reflection-on-action shown in boxes (the distinction of reflection-in- and reflection-on-action is taken from Sch\u00f6n) and in so doing explores, through these different lenses, how the art piece helps or hinders the unpacking of the science that it represents. It also provides a multilayered reflection on the theme of change itself since every aspect of this article, the topic, the art piece, the physics and the textual activity of how the discussion is represented, revolves around representing and observing through different lenses, regenring and transformation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Change", "Observation", "Perspective", "Reflection", "Regenring", "Transformation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051349013", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"57202575418": {"Name": "English F.", "AuthorID": "57202575418", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Linguistics, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
