All rights reserved.As consequence of the steady increase in processing foods consumption, especially because of the current lifestyles of the population, the industry is always creating novel process technology to improve quality, productivity, and attendance of the new markets. Nevertheless, these new technologies, covering thermal and non-thermal processing, affect the value nutritional of food. The vitamins play an important role in the health and can be affected by industrial processing. Modern food processing methods based on short-term treatment such as pulsed electric fields; osmotic dehydration, radiation and high-pressure processing cause negligible degradation of carotenoid. For example, it has been reported that ohmic heating causes no change in carotenoid content; while microwave heating and freeze-drying caused the lowest degradation of carotenoid. Ultrasound treatment of food changed carotenoids into colorless and unknown compounds. These results indicate that although heating processes in short time had a lower degrading effect on carotenoid content, they should be used cautiously to cause the lowest impact on carotenoid content. Regarding the light effect on carotenoid degradation, it has been reported that degradation rate is higher in samples stored at light compared to those kept in darkness. In general, carotenoid degradation can be lowered by reduction temperature, processing time, light and oxygen and application of antioxidants. In this chapter, the effects of processing on bioavailability and bioaccessibility of fat-soluble vitamins were discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioaccessibility", "Bioavailability", "Fat-soluble", "Food processing", "Vitamins"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083256053", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Professions (all)", "HEAL", "3600"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55927243400": {"Name": "Hashemi S.M.B.", "AuthorID": "55927243400", "AffiliationID": "60109046", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Agriculture, Fasa University"}, "56242368900": {"Name": "Pourmohammadi K.", "AuthorID": "56242368900", "AffiliationID": "60109046", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Agriculture, Fasa University"}, "16678760400": {"Name": "Gholamhosseinpour A.", "AuthorID": "16678760400", "AffiliationID": "60159403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Jahrom University"}, "56507330400": {"Name": "Es I.", "AuthorID": "56507330400", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "35422098100": {"Name": "Ferreira D.S.", "AuthorID": "35422098100", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas"}, "57203634349": {"Name": "Khaneghah A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203634349", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas"}}}
