Methods A total of 1,542 men and women in a British birth cohort study had IGF-I and II measured by immunoassay of blood samples at age 53 and/or 60-64 years. Fat mass, android:gynoid fat ratio, and appendicular lean mass were measured at 60-64 years using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Associations between changes in IGF-I or II and body composition outcomes were examined using conditional change linear regression models. Results Mean IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations were lower at 60-64 than at 53 years, by 12.8% for IGF-I and by 12.5% for IGF-II. Larger declines in either IGF-I or II were associated with higher fat mass at 60-64 years. Although higher IGF-I at 53 years was associated with higher lean mass, there was little evidence linking changes in IGF-I or II to lean mass. Conclusions The findings suggest that IGF-I and II concentrations decline with age, and greater declines are associated with higher fat mass levels. These results provide some evidence for the suggested roles of IGF-I and II in regulating fat mass but not lean mass in older age.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adipose Tissue", "Aging", "Body Composition", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor II", "Linear Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle, Skeletal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925248307", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55790281500": {"Name": "Bann D.", "AuthorID": "55790281500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "57204025615": {"Name": "Hardy R.", "AuthorID": "57204025615", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "7102662382": {"Name": "Holly J.M.P.", "AuthorID": "7102662382", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "IGFs and Metabolic Endocrinology, School of Clinical Sciences, Bristol University"}, "6603778949": {"Name": "Lashen H.", "AuthorID": "6603778949", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Metabolism, University of Sheffield"}, "7404783253": {"Name": "Adams J.", "AuthorID": "7404783253", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Central Manchester University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "7102309097": {"Name": "Ong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7102309097", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "7006649063": {"Name": "Ben-Shlomo Y.", "AuthorID": "7006649063", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, Bristol University"}}}
