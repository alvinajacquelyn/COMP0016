We calibrate to London Interbank Offer Rate swaptions data and show that a rational two-factor log-normal multi-curve model is sufficient to match market data with accuracy. We elucidate the relationship between the models developed and calibrated under a risk-neutral measure \u211a and their consistent equivalence class under the real-world probability measure \u2119. The consistent \u2119 -pricing models are applied to compute the risk exposures which may be required to comply with regulatory obligations. In order to compute counterparty-risk valuation adjustments, such as credit valuation adjustment, we show how default intensity processes with rational form can be derived. We flesh out our study by applying the results to a basis swap contract.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Basis swap", "Calibration", "Counterparty-risk", "LIBOR", "Markov functionals", "Multi-curve interest rate term structure models", "Rational asset pricing models", "Risk management"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947218044", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"23570731400": {"Name": "Cr\u00e9pey S.", "AuthorID": "23570731400", "AffiliationID": "60030208, 60106217", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Math\u00e9matiques et Mod\u00e9lisation d\u2019\u00c9vry, Universit\u00e9 \u00c9vry Val d\u2019Essonne"}, "56963085500": {"Name": "Nguyen T.M.", "AuthorID": "56963085500", "AffiliationID": "60030208, 60106217", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Math\u00e9matiques et Mod\u00e9lisation d\u2019\u00c9vry, Universit\u00e9 \u00c9vry Val d\u2019Essonne"}, "24281766900": {"Name": "Macrina A.", "AuthorID": "24281766900", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Actuarial Science, University of Cape Town"}, "35180378100": {"Name": "Skovmand D.", "AuthorID": "35180378100", "AffiliationID": "60020188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Finance, Copenhagen Business School"}}}
