There is Class I evidence for short-term effi cacy of epilepsy surgery from two randomized controlled studies of temporal lobe resection. In order for patients to make an informed decision about the treatment option of epilepsy surgery, they also need data on the probability of long-term remission or improvement. Long-term longitudinal observational studies are necessary in order to obtain valid outcome data. From a number of such studies, the proportion of patients who have been continuously free from seizures with impairment of consciousness since resective surgery seems to be 40-50 % after 10 years, while a higher proportion have been seizure-free at least a year at each time-point assessed. The best longitudinal data are in patients who have undergone temporal lobe resection and in whom the histopathology was mesial sclerosis, and in these patients the majority of relapses occur within 5 years. Whether this course is applicable to other resection types and pathologies is not clear. There is much less information on the longitudinal course in patients who have undergone other resection types and have other causes. For many resection types, the number of patients in single-center long-term follow-ups is limited and for almost all studies there is a lack of controls. Multicenter observational studies following both operated and nonoperated patients are needed in order to obtain more robust data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiepileptic drugs", "Epilepsy surgery", "Long term", "Predictors", "Seizure outcome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943406832", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7003767721": {"Name": "Malmgren K.", "AuthorID": "7003767721", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "55939502700": {"Name": "Edelvik A.", "AuthorID": "55939502700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.S.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epilepsy, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
