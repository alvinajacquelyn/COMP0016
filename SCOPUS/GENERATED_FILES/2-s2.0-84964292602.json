One of the most studied and important is the so-called \"DFG-flip\" of tyrosine kinases. The conserved three amino-acid DFG motif undergoes an \"in to out\" movement resulting in a particular inactive conformation to which \"type II\" kinase inhibitors, such as the anti-cancer drug Imatinib, bind. Despite many studies, the details of this prototypical conformational change are still debated. Here we combine various NMR experiments and surface plasmon resonance with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations to shed light into the conformational dynamics associated with the binding of Imatinib to the proto-oncogene c-Src. We find that both conformational selection and induced fit play a role in the binding mechanism, reconciling opposing views held in the literature. Moreover, an external binding pose and local unfolding (cracking) of the aG helix are observed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Imatinib Mesylate", "Ligands", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Molecular Conformation", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Binding", "src-Family Kinases", "Surface Plasmon Resonance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964292602", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56992663300": {"Name": "Morando M.", "AuthorID": "56992663300", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Center of Technological Development in Health, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ)"}, "23978674400": {"Name": "Saladino G.", "AuthorID": "23978674400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603847960": {"Name": "D'Amelio N.", "AuthorID": "6603847960", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6603509498": {"Name": "Gervasio F.", "AuthorID": "6603509498", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56993986800": {"Name": "Pucheta-Martinez E.", "AuthorID": "56993986800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54960413000": {"Name": "Lovera S.", "AuthorID": "54960413000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6602193253": {"Name": "Lelli M.", "AuthorID": "6602193253", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, University of Florence"}, "6506548056": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-M\u00e9ndez B.", "AuthorID": "6506548056", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Spectroscopy and NMR Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "36504494400": {"Name": "Marenchino M.", "AuthorID": "36504494400", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Spectroscopy and NMR Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}, "6701394622": {"Name": "Campos-Olivas R.", "AuthorID": "6701394622", "AffiliationID": "60008948", "AffiliationName": "Spectroscopy and NMR Unit, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO)"}}}
