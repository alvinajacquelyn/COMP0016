All rights reserved.Cerebral autoregulation (CA) dampens transfer of blood pressure (BP)-fluctuations onto cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV). Thus, CBFV-oscillations precede BP-oscillations. The phase angle (PA) between sympathetically mediated low-frequency (LF: 0.03-0.15 Hz) BP- and CBFV-oscillations is a measure of CA quality. To evaluate whether PA depends on sympathetic modulation, we assessed PA-changes upon sympathetic stimulation with and without pharmacologic sympathetic blockade. In 10 healthy, young men, we monitored mean BP and CBFV before and during 120-second cold pressor stimulation (CPS) of one foot (0\u00b0C ice-water). We calculated mean values, standard deviations and sympathetic LF-powers of all signals, and PAs between LF-BP- and LF-CBFV-oscillations. We repeated measurements after ingestion of the adrenoceptor-blocker carvedilol (25 mg). We compared parameters before and during CPS, without and after carvedilol (analysis of variance, post-hoc t-tests, significance: p < 0.05). Without carvedilol, CPS increased BP, CBFV, BP-LF- and CBFV-LF-powers, and shortened PA. Carvedilol decreased resting BP, CBFV, BP-LF- and CBFV-LF-powers, while PAs remained unchanged. During CPS, BPs, CBFVs, BP-LF- and CBFV-LF-powers were lower, while PAs were longer with than without carvedilol. With carvedilol, CPS no longer shortened resting PA. Sympathetic activation shortens PA. Partial adrenoceptor blockade abolishes this PA-shortening. Thus, PA-measurements provide a subtle marker of sympathetic influences on CA and might refine CA evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood pressure", "Cerebral blood flow velocity", "Pharmacologic stress", "Phase angle", "Sympathetic nerve activity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Determination", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Cold Temperature", "Healthy Volunteers", "Heart Rate", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Male", "Monoterpenes", "Pressure", "Sympathetic Nervous System", "Sympatholytics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964661138", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7005993594": {"Name": "Hilz M.", "AuthorID": "7005993594", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "57210193376": {"Name": "Wang R.", "AuthorID": "57210193376", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "57189002507": {"Name": "Liu M.", "AuthorID": "57189002507", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "57184029800": {"Name": "Tillmann A.", "AuthorID": "57184029800", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "55005687700": {"Name": "Riss S.", "AuthorID": "55005687700", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "57189004764": {"Name": "Hauck P.", "AuthorID": "57189004764", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "56251690800": {"Name": "Stemper B.", "AuthorID": "56251690800", "AffiliationID": "60099558", "AffiliationName": "Bayer HealthCare, Bayer Pharma AG, Global Development Specialty Medicine, Building P300"}, "12774870000": {"Name": "K\u00f6hrmann M.", "AuthorID": "12774870000", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}, "6602482223": {"Name": "Marthol H.", "AuthorID": "6602482223", "AffiliationID": "60006436", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Addiction, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Klinikum Am Europakanal"}, "22985424400": {"Name": "H\u00f6sl K.", "AuthorID": "22985424400", "AffiliationID": "115260673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Paracelsus Medical University Nuremberg"}, "6505545040": {"Name": "Wasmeier G.", "AuthorID": "6505545040", "AffiliationID": "116084115", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Klinik Neustadt A.
