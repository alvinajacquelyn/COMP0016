The Authors.Enhancements of electron fluxes in the outer radiation belt have been closely linked to increases in solar wind speed and density as well as to prolonged intervals of southward interplanetary magnetic field. Periodic oscillations in the Earth's magnetic field with frequencies in the range of a few millihertz (ultralow frequency or ultralow frequency waves) may be an intermediary through which these solar wind drivers influence radiation belt dynamics due to their potential for resonant interactions with energetic electrons causing the radial migration of resonant electrons. Using data from more than 180 ground magnetometers contributing to the worldwide SuperMAG collaboration, we explore possible relationships between relativistic electron flux variations and the spatial and temporal profiles of ultralow frequency wave power contained in the Pc5 frequency band (2\u20137 mHz). During 19 geomagnetic storms marked by relativistic (1.5 MeV < E < 6 MeV) electron flux enhancements and 19 storms that led to prolonged electron flux depletions, Pc5 wave power is found penetrating to L shells as low as 2\u20133. The enhancement of Pc5 wave power starts almost simultaneously with the storm onset. The depth of wave activity penetration was found associated with the strength of geomagnetic activity (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.54), which is also related to the location of electron flux maximum observed in the recovery phase. Pc5 wave activity persists longer (for up to \u224862 hr) for those storms that produced relativistic electrons. We also investigate the combination of interplanetary conditions necessary to differentiate the response of relativistic electron fluxes to geomagnetic storms. A coupling function that captures the increased reconnection rate at the dayside magnetopause affecting magnetospheric processes which may produce Pc5 wave power offers an additional key to further understanding the outer belt dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["interplanetary coronal mass ejections", "magnetic storms", "radiation belts", "relativistic electrons", "solar wind", "ULF waves"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058384866", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"55542290900": {"Name": "Georgiou M.", "AuthorID": "55542290900", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Panepistimioupolis Zografos"}, "7003431703": {"Name": "Rae I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003431703", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Department of Space and Climate Physics, University College London"}, "6604098494": {"Name": "Daglis I.A.", "AuthorID": "6604098494", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Panepistimioupolis Zografos"}, "6603849973": {"Name": "Tsinganos K.", "AuthorID": "6603849973", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Panepistimioupolis Zografos"}, "8429171400": {"Name": "Zesta E.", "AuthorID": "8429171400", "AffiliationID": "60006337, 60016296", "AffiliationName": "Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration"}, "7003293674": {"Name": "Sibeck D.G.", "AuthorID": "7003293674", "AffiliationID": "60006337, 60016296", "AffiliationName": "Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration"}, "7006618037": {"Name": "Mann I.R.", "AuthorID": "7006618037", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Alberta"}, "6506101367": {"Name": "Balasis G.", "AuthorID": "6506101367", "AffiliationID": "60011619", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing, National Observatory of Athens"}}}
