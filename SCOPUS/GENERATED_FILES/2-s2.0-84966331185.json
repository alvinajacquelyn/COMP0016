Chemical synthesis of nearly 30 derivatives has resulted in ligands of representatives of three subfamilies of human bromodomains with favorable ligand efficiency. The X-ray crystal structures of three different bromodomains (CREBBP, BAZ2B, and BRPF1b) in complex with acetyl indole derivatives reveal the influence of the gatekeeper residue on the orientation of small-molecule ligands in the acetyl lysine binding site.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Binding Sites", "Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic", "Computer Simulation", "CREB-Binding Protein", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Humans", "Indoles", "Indolizines", "Ligands", "Lysine", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Nuclear Proteins", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Proteins", "Small Molecule Libraries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966331185", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"55574067100": {"Name": "Unzue A.", "AuthorID": "55574067100", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "57189211795": {"Name": "Zechner M.", "AuthorID": "57189211795", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "57189211685": {"Name": "Dolbois A.", "AuthorID": "57189211685", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "6602968552": {"Name": "Nevado C.", "AuthorID": "6602968552", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "55715838700": {"Name": "Zhao H.", "AuthorID": "55715838700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "8833020700": {"Name": "Lolli G.", "AuthorID": "8833020700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "55387222200": {"Name": "Dong J.", "AuthorID": "55387222200", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "57189223300": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "57189223300", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "7006219601": {"Name": "Caflisch A.", "AuthorID": "7006219601", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}}}
