At this locality, only two genera namely Elphidium de Montfort 1808 and Ammonia Br\u00fcnnich 1772 were observed in a depth transect. The genus Elphidium dominated the foraminiferal assemblages, supporting the idea of its resistant nature in a siliciclastic environment where the mechanical action of waves and minor accumulations of organic matter prevent abundant and/or diversified foraminiferal assemblages. Environmental analysis suggests that the site is completely unpolluted, and the foraminiferal assemblage is unaffected by anthropogenic factors and only reflects seasonal and substrate parameters. It can be therefore considered as a benchmark for future studies along the Saudi coastline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report presenting information on foraminiferal assemblages from a siliciclastic environment in the western Arabian Gulf, as previous studies were reported from carbonate sand and muddy substrates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arabian Gulf", "Benthic foraminifera", "Elphidium", "Half Moon Bay", "Saudi coastline", "Siliciclastic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962195726", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56412456100": {"Name": "Arslan M.", "AuthorID": "56412456100", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Geosciences Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}, "7202547764": {"Name": "Kaminski M.", "AuthorID": "7202547764", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Geosciences Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}, "6508032548": {"Name": "Tawabini B.", "AuthorID": "6508032548", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Geosciences Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals"}, "57212628191": {"Name": "Ilyas M.", "AuthorID": "57212628191", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals"}, "23034243700": {"Name": "Frontalini F.", "AuthorID": "23034243700", "AffiliationID": "60032111", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Pure e Applicate (DiSPeA), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Urbino \u201cCarlo Bo\u201d"}}}
