Moreover, the relationship between CSF NfL and tau measures to further axonal and (neuro)degeneration markers still needs to be elucidated. Our analysis included 89 ALS patients [median (range) age 63 (33\u201383) years, 61% male, disease duration 10 (0.2\u2013190) months] and 33 age- and sex-matched disease controls [60 (32\u201376), 49%]. NfL was higher and the ptau/ttau ratio was lower in ALS compared to controls [8343 (1795\u201335,945) pg/ml vs. 1193 (612\u20132616), H(1) = 70.8, p < 0.001; mean (SD) 0.17 (0.04) vs. 0.2 (0.03), F(1) = 14.3, p < 0.001], as well as in upper motor neuron dominant (UMND, n = 10) compared to classic (n = 46) or lower motor neuron dominant ALS [n = 31; for NfL: 16,076 (7447\u201335,945) vs. 8205 (2651\u201335,138) vs. 8057 (1795\u201334,951)], Z \u2265 2.5, p \u2264 0.01; for the ptau/ttau ratio: [0.13 (0.04) vs. 0.17 (0.04) vs. 0.18 (0.03), p \u2264 0.02]. In ALS, NfL and the ptau/ttau ratio were related to corticospinal tract (CST) fractional anisotropy (FA) and radial diffusivity (ROI-based approach and whole-brain voxelwise analysis). Factor analysis of mixed data revealed a co-variance pattern between NfL (factor load \u2212 0.6), the ptau/ttau ratio (0.7), CST FA (0.8) and UMND ALS phenotype (\u2212 2.8). NfL did not relate to any further neuroaxonal injury marker (brain volumes, precentral gyrus thickness, peripheral motor amplitudes, sonographic cross-sectional nerve area), but a lower ptau/ttau ratio was associated with whole-brain gray matter atrophy and widespread white matter integrity loss. Higher NfL baseline levels were associated with greater UMN disease burden, more rapid disease progression, a twofold to threefold greater hazard of death and shorter survival times. The findings that higher CSF NfL levels and a reduced ptau/ttau ratio are more associated with clinical UMN involvement and with reduced CST FA offer strong converging evidence that both are markers of central motor degeneration. Furthermore, NfL is a marker of poor prognosis, while a low ptau/ttau ratio indicates extramotor pathology in ALS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Diffusion tensor imaging", "MRI", "Neurofilament light chain", "Ptau/ttau ratio", "Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau)", "Ttau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Phosphorylation", "Retrospective Studies", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052965181", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26868119400": {"Name": "Schreiber S.", "AuthorID": "26868119400", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Within the Helmholtz Association"}, "26868229700": {"Name": "Schreiber F.", "AuthorID": "26868229700", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t Braunschweig"}, "8085171900": {"Name": "Kaufmann J.", "AuthorID": "8085171900", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "37101953200": {"Name": "Machts J.", "AuthorID": "37101953200", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Within the Helmholtz Association"}, "14055830800": {"Name": "Debska-Vielhaber G.", "AuthorID": "14055830800", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "48662045900": {"Name": "Garz C.", "AuthorID": "48662045900", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Within the Helmholtz Association"}, "7003720620": {"Name": "Bittner D.", "AuthorID": "7003720620", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Within the Helmholtz Association"}, "57201979019": {"Name": "Hensiek N.", "AuthorID": "57201979019", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "7003299232": {"Name": "Vielhaber S.", "AuthorID": "7003299232", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Within the Helmholtz Association"}, "55324250100": {"Name": "Spotorno N.", "AuthorID": "55324250100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) Within the Helmholtz Association"}, "8235719600": {"Name": "Acosta-Cabronero J.", "AuthorID": "8235719600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57189881899": {"Name": "Nestor P.", "AuthorID": "57189881899", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland"}, "7102319878": {"Name": "Dengler R.", "AuthorID": "7102319878", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School"}, "56740505800": {"Name": "Petri S.", "AuthorID": "56740505800", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hannover Medical School"}}}
