Through advances in recombinant DNA technology, gene therapy is being developed for a large number of inherited and acquired diseases. Although cystic fibrosis (CF) gene therapy has been at the forefront of gene therapy research since cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in 1989 (see Table 36.1 for key publications), other disease targets including immune deficiencies, degenerative eye disorders [1], and hemophilia [2] have provided a greater degree of clinical efficacy. This is in part due to the lung being a more difficult target organ to treat than originally anticipated. In addition, conclusive phase IIB clinical trials are expensive and difficult to perform because of the large surface area to be treated. This realization has, over the last 10 years, led to a waning enthusiasm for CF gene therapy, which is currently only being performed by a small number of committed mainly academic groups.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053991506", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6701826068": {"Name": "Griesenbach U.", "AuthorID": "6701826068", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gene Therapy, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, The UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium"}, "7006149738": {"Name": "Alton E.", "AuthorID": "7006149738", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gene Therapy, National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College London, The UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium"}}}
