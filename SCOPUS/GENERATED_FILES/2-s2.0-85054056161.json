Little is known about how GPs manage patients with depression that does not respond to medication. Aim To describe usual care for primary care patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Design and setting Mixed-methods study using data from a UK primary care multicentre randomised controlled trial. Method In total, 235 patients with TRD randomised to continue with usual GP care were followed up at 3-month intervals for a year. Self-report data were collected on antidepressant medication, number of GP visits, and other treatments received. In addition, 14 semi-structured face-toface interviews were conducted with a purposive sample after the 6-month follow-up and analysed thematically. Results Most patients continued on the same dose of a single antidepressant between baseline and 3 months (n = 147/186 at 3 months, 79% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 73 to 85%)). Figures were similar for later follow-ups (for example, 9-12 months: 72% (95% CI = 63 to 79%). Medication changes (increasing dose; switching to a different antidepressant; adding a second antidepressant) were uncommon. Participants described usual care mainly as taking antidepressants, with consultations focused on other (physical) health concerns. Few accessed other treatments or were referred to secondary care. Conclusion Usual care in patients with TRD mainly entailed taking antidepressants, and medication changes were uncommon. The high prevalence of physical and psychological comorbidity means that, when these patients consult, their depression may not be discussed. Strategies are needed to ensure the active management of this large group of patients whose depression does not respond to antidepressant medication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antidepressants", "Depression", "Management", "Mixed methods", "Primary care", "Treatment resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antidepressive Agents", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Primary Health Care", "Qualitative Research", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054056161", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"6602536089": {"Name": "Wiles N.", "AuthorID": "6602536089", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57199266735": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57199266735", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "56642345800": {"Name": "Turner N.", "AuthorID": "56642345800", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "7401475928": {"Name": "Barnes M.", "AuthorID": "7401475928", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "14036585400": {"Name": "Thomas L.", "AuthorID": "14036585400", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "36798567100": {"Name": "Kessler D.", "AuthorID": "36798567100", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "55323557300": {"Name": "Campbell J.", "AuthorID": "55323557300", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Research Group, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "7402636448": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7403196420": {"Name": "Morrison J.", "AuthorID": "7403196420", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, General Practice and Primary Care Group, University of Glasgow"}, "57211284405": {"Name": "Peters T.J.", "AuthorID": "57211284405", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650, 60016447", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Southmead Hospital"}, "7201493723": {"Name": "Turner K.", "AuthorID": "7201493723", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60170515", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership, Applied Health Research and Care West (NIHR CLAHRC West), University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
