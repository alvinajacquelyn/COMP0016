Currently, the genetic basis of both phenotypes remains to be elucidated. We conduct genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for \u0394HRex and \u0394HRrec in ~40,000 individuals, followed by replication in ~27,000 independent samples, all from UK Biobank. Six and seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms for \u0394HRex and \u0394HRrec, respectively, formally replicate. In a full data set GWAS, eight further loci for \u0394HRex and nine for \u0394HRrec are genome-wide significant (P \u2264 5 \u00d7 10-8). In total, 30 loci are discovered, 8 being common across traits. Processes of neural development and modulation of adrenergic activity by the autonomic nervous system are enriched in these results. Our findings reinforce current understanding of HR response to exercise and recovery and could guide future studies evaluating its contribution to cardiovascular risk prediction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomic Nervous System", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Exercise", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047054894", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55637370300": {"Name": "Ram\u00edrez J.", "AuthorID": "55637370300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57202081467": {"Name": "Duijvenboden S.", "AuthorID": "57202081467", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "22835706900": {"Name": "Ntalla I.", "AuthorID": "22835706900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56595087800": {"Name": "Mifsud B.", "AuthorID": "56595087800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Centre, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55386322500": {"Name": "Warren H.", "AuthorID": "55386322500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Centre, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57202078930": {"Name": "Tzanis E.", "AuthorID": "57202078930", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Centre, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005427027": {"Name": "Tinker A.", "AuthorID": "7005427027", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Centre, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005376453": {"Name": "Munroe P.", "AuthorID": "7005376453", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Centre, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomews Hospital"}, "26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
