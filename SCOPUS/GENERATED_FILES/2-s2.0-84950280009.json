This paper introduces a methodology for the collection and analysis of data from Social Media, for transportation-related uses, first in a generic methodological framework and then particularly for Twitter. The data collection methodology is applied using Twitter and some initial descriptive statistics are presented concerning the characteristics of users and their posts. Results from spatial analysis is presented, conducted using data from the geotagged service of Twitter. The results of the analysis present trends on the use of Twitter for leisure activities and a correlation between high income areas and number of tweets posted. Finally, the potential of using data from Social Media is discussed with the issues that arise.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis of data", "Data collection", "Descriptive statistics", "Leisure activities", "Methodological frameworks", "Mobility pattern", "Spatial analysis", "Transportation research"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950280009", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57060622700": {"Name": "Chaniotakis E.", "AuthorID": "57060622700", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "School of Rural and Surveying Engineering, National Technical University Athens"}, "7004031914": {"Name": "Antoniou C.", "AuthorID": "7004031914", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "School of Rural and Surveying Engineering, National Technical University Athens"}}}
