In this study, we report the successful adaptation of solid agar-based spot culture growth inhibition assay (SPOTi) for dermatophytes, currently being used as a gold-standard in the anti-tubercular drug discovery field. The fungal-SPOTi assay correlated with the disc-diffusion method, and is validated using mycelial plugs. We propose the fungal-SPOTi as a high-throughput alternative to the disc-diffusion and broth micro-dilution anti-fungal assays to screen novel anti-fungals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antifungals", "Dermatophytes", "Drug discovery", "Screening", "SPOTi"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antifungal Agents", "Arthrodermataceae", "Drug Discovery", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Trichophyton"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937685094", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"36700218700": {"Name": "Rizi K.", "AuthorID": "36700218700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "55078653600": {"Name": "Murdan S.", "AuthorID": "55078653600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "33067517000": {"Name": "Danquah C.A.", "AuthorID": "33067517000", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6603636055": {"Name": "Faull J.", "AuthorID": "6603636055", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6701498589": {"Name": "Bhakta S.", "AuthorID": "6701498589", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
