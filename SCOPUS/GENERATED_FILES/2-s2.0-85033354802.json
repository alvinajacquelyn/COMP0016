All rights reserved.Pain in dementia is a frequent occurring problem. This chapter provides insight in the challenges and opportunities of assessing and managing pain in older people with dementia. The patient's self-report reflects the older persons' subjective experience of pain the best. However due to the communicative and cognitive problems, the use of self-report is often restricted. Therefore a variety of observational pain assessment tools have been developed to optimize the assessment and registration of pain. The chapter furthermore discusses the use of interventions developed to relieve the pain in older people with dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Behavior", "Management", "Pain", "Tools"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033354802", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6507184874": {"Name": "Zwakhalen S.", "AuthorID": "6507184874", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research, CAPHRI School for Public Health and Primary Care, Maastricht University"}}}
