However, to date the majority of studies in the context of education have predominantly focused on University students. This paper explores how gamification could potentially benefit a specific student population, children with dyslexia who are transitioning from primary to secondary school. Two teachers from specialist dyslexia teaching centres used classDojo, a gamification platform, during their teaching sessions for one term. We detail how the teachers appropriated the platform in different ways and how the students discussed classDojo in terms of motivation. These findings have subsequently informed a set of provisional implications for gamification distilling opportunities for future pedagogical uses, gamification design for special education and methodological approaches to how gamification is studied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dyslexia", "Educational Technology", "Gamification", "SEN"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dyslexia", "Gamification", "Methodological approach", "Pedagogical use", "Secondary schools", "Special education", "Student populations", "University students"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985946793", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"39061306900": {"Name": "Gooch D.", "AuthorID": "39061306900", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education"}, "8950143700": {"Name": "Vasalou A.", "AuthorID": "8950143700", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education"}, "39060961100": {"Name": "Benton L.", "AuthorID": "39060961100", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education"}, "14035679300": {"Name": "Khaled R.", "AuthorID": "14035679300", "AffiliationID": "60033154", "AffiliationName": "Concordia University"}}}
