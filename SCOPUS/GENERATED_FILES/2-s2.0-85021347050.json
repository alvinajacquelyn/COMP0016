Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Faculty of Public Health. All rights reserved.Background Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of death worldwide due to a single infectious agent. Rates of active TB in places of prescribed detention (PPD), which include Prisons, Young Offender Institutions and Immigration Removal Centres, are high compared with the general population. PPD therefore present an opportunity to develop targeted health programmes for TB control. This audit aims to assess current service provisions and identify barriers to achieving best practice standards in PPD across London. Methods Twelve healthcare teams within PPD commissioned by NHS England (London Region) were included in the audit. Services were evaluated against the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence standards for TB best practice. Results None of the health providers with a digital X-ray machine were conducting active case finding in new prisoners and no health providers routinely conduct Latent TB infection testing and preventative treatment. Barriers to implementing standards include the lack of staff skills and staff skills mix, structural and technical barriers, and demands of custodial and health services. Conclusions This audit restates the importance of national public health TB strategies to consider healthcare provisions across PPD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["health services", "management and policy", "prisons"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antitubercular Agents", "Delivery of Health Care", "Emigration and Immigration", "Female", "Health Services", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prisoners", "Prisons", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021347050", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"41661785000": {"Name": "Mehay A.", "AuthorID": "41661785000", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "School of Law, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "57196483142": {"Name": "Frater A.", "AuthorID": "57196483142", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "School of Law, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "57162846000": {"Name": "Raj T.", "AuthorID": "57162846000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England (London Region), 4th Floor"}, "47761036700": {"Name": "Altass L.", "AuthorID": "47761036700", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "NHS England and Public Health England, PHE Colindale"}, "56035696600": {"Name": "Newton A.", "AuthorID": "56035696600", "AffiliationID": "100678199", "AffiliationName": "Wellington House"}, "57194471949": {"Name": "O'Moore E.", "AuthorID": "57194471949", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Premier House"}, "56543032300": {"Name": "Railton C.", "AuthorID": "56543032300", "AffiliationID": "60104702, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, FERA"}, "57194641941": {"Name": "Tan H.", "AuthorID": "57194641941", "AffiliationID": "114485085", "AffiliationName": "NHS England (London Region)"}, "57220350438": {"Name": "Story A.", "AuthorID": "57220350438", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}}}
