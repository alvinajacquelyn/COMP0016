This pathway purportedly runs from the superior colliculus to the amygdala via the pulvinar, and thus presents a methodological challenge to study noninvasively in the human brain. Here, we present our recent work where we reliably reconstructed the white matter structure and directional flow of neural signal along this pathway in over 600 healthy young adults. Critically, we found structure-function relationships for the pulvinar-amygdala connection, where people with greater fibre density had stronger functional neural coupling and were also better at recognising fearful facial expressions. These results tie together recent anatomical evidence from other visual primates with very recent optogenetic research on rodents demonstrating a functional role of this pathway in producing fear responses. Here, we discuss how this pathway might operate alongside other thalamo-cortical circuits (such as pulvinar to middle temporal area) and how its structure and function may change according to the sensory input it receives. This newly established circuit might play a potentially important role in autism and/or anxiety disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amygdala", "Connectivity", "Fear", "Pulvinar", "Superior colliculus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068042443", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56538356500": {"Name": "McFadyen J.", "AuthorID": "56538356500", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland"}}}
