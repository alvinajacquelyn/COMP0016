Printed in Greece. All rights reserved.Archaeological surveys and excavations carried out in two areas of the municipality of Ca\u00f1amero (C\u00e1ceres, Spain) have revealed the presence of significant Middle Palaeolithic stone tool assemblages. This paper contextualizes the site at a regional scale and presents its chronological evolution over time, accounting for the different post-depositional processes. To do so, different techniques and methodologies have been implemented, including archaeology, geomorphology, and GIS analysis. The aim is to understand the genesis and evolution of these kinds of Middle Palaeolithic settlements and to characterize them in contemporary soils.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geoarchaeology", "GIS", "Middle Palaeolithic", "Neanderthal", "Open-air sites"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038409988", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57194851056": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez J.F.", "AuthorID": "57194851056", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "57199715384": {"Name": "Alonso D.\u00c1.", "AuthorID": "57199715384", "AffiliationID": "60028711", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Prehistoria y Arqueolog\u00eda, UNED-Asturias"}, "57219394553": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez P.A.", "AuthorID": "57219394553", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60104356", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Heritage Sciences (INCIPIT-CSIC), Division of Archaeology, University of Cambridge"}}}
