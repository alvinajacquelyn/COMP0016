The detector used consisted of an array of 520 \u00d7 520 pixels on a 25 \u03bcm pitch. Dosimetric parameters measured with this sensor were compared with data collected with an ionization chamber, a film detector and GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations. The sensor performance for beam profiles measurements was evaluated for field sizes of 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup>. The high spatial resolution achieved with this sensor allowed the accurate measurement of profiles, beam penumbrae and field size under lateral electronic disequilibrium. Field size and penumbrae agreed within 5.4% and 2.2% respectively with film measurements. Agreements with ionization chambers better than 1.0% were obtained when measuring tissue-phantom ratios. Output factor measurements were in good agreement with ionization chamber and Monte Carlo simulation. The data obtained from this imaging sensor can be easily analyzed to extract dosimetric information. The results presented in this work are promising for the development and implementation of CMOS active pixel sensors for dosimetry applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CMOS active pixel sensors", "geant4", "Monte Carlo simulation", "photon transfer curves", "small-field dosimetry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate measurement", "CMOS active pixel sensors", "Dosimetric parameter", "geant4", "High spatial resolution", "Output factor measurements", "Photon transfer curve", "Sensor performance", "Monte Carlo Method", "Photons", "Radiometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930226151", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56663191200": {"Name": "Spang F.J.", "AuthorID": "56663191200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "7005472272": {"Name": "Royle G.", "AuthorID": "7005472272", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "56517665100": {"Name": "Rosenberg I.", "AuthorID": "56517665100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55645201300": {"Name": "Hedin E.", "AuthorID": "55645201300", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Physics, Sahlgrenska Universitetssjukhuset"}}}
