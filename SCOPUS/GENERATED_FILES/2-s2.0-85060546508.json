Ti 3 C 2 , though one of the most extensively studied 2D MXenes, is rarely reported in dye-sensitized photocatalysis. Platinum is commonly used as a co-catalyst in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution but it increases the cost and hence restricts the commercialization of this technology. Eosin Y (EY) is widely studied in dye-sensitized systems as it is not only low-cost and easily commercially available, but also exhibits excellent visible light absorption ability. Herein, we oxidized Ti 3 C 2 MXene in water at 60 \u00b0C for different times, to form TiO 2 /Ti 3 C 2 on amorphous carbon (AC) composites. The oxidized MXene was used as a photocatalyst in a dye-sensitized system for hydrogen evolution to replace noble metal co-catalysts such as Pt. The highest hydrogen production rate of 33.4 \u03bcmol h -1 g -1 was achieved by the TiO 2 /Ti 3 C 2 @AC-48h composite with the sensitization of 1 mM EY, which was 110 times higher than that of oxidized Ti 3 C 2 without EY. This work shows the potential of 2D MXenes used in dye-sensitized photocatalysis for hydrogen evolution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amorphous carbon (a-C)", "Co catalysts", "Dye sensitized", "Hydrogen evolution", "Hydrogen production rate", "Low costs", "Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution", "Visible light absorption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060546508", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"57202135265": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "57202135265", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Physics and Technology for Advanced Batteries, Ministry of Education, College of Physics, Jilin University"}, "57194442226": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "57194442226", "AffiliationID": "60007711, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Physics and Technology for Advanced Batteries, Ministry of Education, College of Physics, Jilin University"}, "7401629624": {"Name": "Meng X.", "AuthorID": "7401629624", "AffiliationID": "60014662", "AffiliationName": "A.
