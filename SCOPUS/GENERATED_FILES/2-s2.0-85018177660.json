Despite intense scrutiny however, the mechanism of the misfolding reaction remains unclear. We perform nuclear Magnetic Resonance and thermodynamic stability measurements on the C-terminal domains (residues 90-231) of two PrP variants exhibiting different pH-induced susceptibilities to aggregation: the susceptible hamster prion (GHaPrP) and its less susceptible rabbit homolog (RaPrP). The pKa of histidines in these domains are determined from titration experiments, and proton-exchange rates are measured at pH 5 and pH 7. A single buried highly conserved histidine, H187/H186 in GHaPrP/RaPrP, exhibited a markedly down shifted pKa ~5 for both proteins. However, noticeably larger pH-induced shifts in exchange rates occur for GHaPrP versus RaPrP. Analysis of the data indicates that protonation of the buried histidine destabilizes both PrP variants, but produces a more drastic effect in the less stable GHaPrP. This interpretation is supported by urea denaturation experiments performed on both PrP variants at neutral and low pH, and correlates with the difference in disease susceptibility of the two species, as expected from the documented linkage between destabilization of the folded state and formation of misfolded and aggregated species.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cricetinae", "Histidine", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Models, Molecular", "Prion Proteins", "Protein Domains", "Protein Folding", "Protein Stability", "Protons", "Rabbits", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018177660", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6602416665": {"Name": "Malevanets A.", "AuthorID": "6602416665", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Molecular Structure and Function, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "36906848900": {"Name": "Chong P.", "AuthorID": "36906848900", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto"}, "57210028346": {"Name": "Rizk P.", "AuthorID": "57210028346", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto"}, "57188814844": {"Name": "Lin H.", "AuthorID": "57188814844", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Program in Molecular Structure and Function, Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7202300513": {"Name": "Kay L.", "AuthorID": "7202300513", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Toronto"}, "7005096957": {"Name": "Forman-Kay J.", "AuthorID": "7005096957", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto"}, "7005682828": {"Name": "Wodak S.", "AuthorID": "7005682828", "AffiliationID": "60019793, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "VIB Structural Biology Research Center, VUB"}, "25924919300": {"Name": "Hansen D.", "AuthorID": "25924919300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Biosciences"}, "6508094746": {"Name": "Muhandiram R.", "AuthorID": "6508094746", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto"}, "56562034800": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "56562034800", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto"}, "7004871184": {"Name": "Chakrabartty A.", "AuthorID": "7004871184", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto"}}}
