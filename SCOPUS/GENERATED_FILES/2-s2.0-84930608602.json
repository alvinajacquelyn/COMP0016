The class of systems to which this method applies is addressed. Static output feedback is utilized in the design of the switching surface, while a novel LMI based optimization approach is employed in the construction of the control law. The efficacy of the algorithms is demonstrated on a non-trival design example; the regulation of the state trajectories of an unstable 8th-order helicopter model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["LMI's", "output feedback", "Sliding modes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Helicopter model", "LMI's", "Optimization approach", "Output feedback", "Sliding modes", "Static output feedback", "Switching surfaces", "Uncertain dynamic systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930608602", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"6506200725": {"Name": "Akoachere A.", "AuthorID": "6506200725", "AffiliationID": "60109013", "AffiliationName": "Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd, Bridge Works"}, "56642060300": {"Name": "Edwards C.", "AuthorID": "56642060300", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Leicester"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.K.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Leicester"}}}
