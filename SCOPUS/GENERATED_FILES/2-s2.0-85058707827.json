To operate at this theoretical upper limit and maximize acquisition speed, a custom-built fiber laser capable of operating at a PRF of up to 2 MHz was combined with a fast laser scanning optical OR-PAM system based on a stationary fiber-optic ultrasound sensor. A large area (10 mm \u00d7 10 mm) of the mouse ear was imaged within 8 s, when acquiring 16 million A-lines and operating the laser at a PRF of 2 MHz. This corresponds to a factor of four improvement in imaging speed compared to the fastest OR-PAM system previously reported. The ability to operate at high-imaging frame rates also allows the capture of hemodynamic events such as blood flow. It is considered that this system offers opportunities for high throughput imaging and visualizing dynamic physiological events using OR-PAM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fiber laser", "microscopy", "optical resolution photoacoustic microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["High-Throughput Imaging", "Imaging speed", "Laser scanning", "Optical resolution", "Pulse repetition frequencies", "Pulsed excitation", "Range ambiguity", "Ultrasound sensors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058707827", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57213655806": {"Name": "Allen T.", "AuthorID": "57213655806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "6507089413": {"Name": "Ogunlade O.", "AuthorID": "6507089413", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "56490897500": {"Name": "Spurrell J.", "AuthorID": "56490897500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Optoelectronics Research Centre"}, "7003634341": {"Name": "Berendt M.", "AuthorID": "7003634341", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Optoelectronics Research Centre"}, "55914347200": {"Name": "Alam S.", "AuthorID": "55914347200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Optoelectronics Research Centre"}, "57209551557": {"Name": "Richardson D.", "AuthorID": "57209551557", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Optoelectronics Research Centre"}}}
