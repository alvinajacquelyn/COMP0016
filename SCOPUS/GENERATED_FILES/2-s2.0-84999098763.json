All rights reserved.The \"Beijing\" Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) lineage 2 (L2) is spreading globally and has been associated with accelerated disease progression and increased antibiotic resistance. Here we performed a phylodynamic reconstruction of one of the L2 sublineages, the central Asian clade (CAC), which has recently spread to western Europe. We find that recent historical events have contributed to the evolution and dispersal of the CAC. Our timing estimates indicate that the clade was likely introduced to Afghanistan during the 1979-1989 Soviet-Afghan war and spread further after population displacement in the wakeof the American invasion in 2001. We also find that drug resistance mutations accumulated on a massive scale in Mtb isolates from former Soviet republics after the fall of the Soviet Union, a pattern that was not observed in CAC isolates from Afghanistan. Our results underscore the detrimental effects of political instability and population displacement on tuberculosis control and demonstrate the power of phylodynamic methods in exploring bacterial evolution in space and time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial resistance", "Evolution", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Phylodynamic analysis", "Tip-dating"], "IndexKeywords": ["Afghanistan", "Armed Conflicts", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Europe", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genotype", "Humans", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Phylogeny", "Tuberculosis", "United States", "USSR"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999098763", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14829994200": {"Name": "Eldholm V.", "AuthorID": "14829994200", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "56704644400": {"Name": "Pettersson J.", "AuthorID": "56704644400", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "55806051700": {"Name": "Brynildsrud O.", "AuthorID": "55806051700", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "57189234600": {"Name": "R\u00f8nning J.", "AuthorID": "57189234600", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "37037973000": {"Name": "Mengshoel A.", "AuthorID": "37037973000", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "57192171646": {"Name": "Debech N.", "AuthorID": "57192171646", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "26021691600": {"Name": "Alfsnes K.", "AuthorID": "26021691600", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "35239694300": {"Name": "Bohlin J.", "AuthorID": "35239694300", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Infection Control and Environmental Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health"}, "23489084200": {"Name": "Kitchen A.", "AuthorID": "23489084200", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Iowa"}, "36965212700": {"Name": "Rasmussen E.", "AuthorID": "36965212700", "AffiliationID": "60025543", "AffiliationName": "International Reference Laboratory of Mycobacteriology, Statens Serum Institute"}, "7003873859": {"Name": "Lillebaek T.", "AuthorID": "7003873859", "AffiliationID": "60025543", "AffiliationName": "International Reference Laboratory of Mycobacteriology, Statens Serum Institute"}, "6504491495": {"Name": "Crudu V.", "AuthorID": "6504491495", "AffiliationID": "117780822", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology and Morphology Laboratory, Phthisiopneumology Institute"}, "56064197600": {"Name": "Pepperell C.", "AuthorID": "56064197600", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "6701693410": {"Name": "Balloux F.", "AuthorID": "6701693410", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}}}
