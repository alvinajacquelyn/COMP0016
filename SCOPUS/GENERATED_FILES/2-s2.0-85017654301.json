The MSDinter introduces \u201cinteraction effects\u201d terms into the popular matched subspace detector (MSD), from regression analysis in multivariate statistics and the bilinear mixing model in hyperspectral unmixing. In this way, the interaction between the target and the surrounding background, which should have but not yet been considered by the MSD, is modelled and estimated, such that superior performance of target detection can be achieved. Besides deriving the MSDinter methodologically, we also demonstrate its superiority empirically using two hyperspectral imaging datasets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bilinear mixing model (BMM)", "Hyperspectral image (HSI)", "Interaction effects", "Linear mixing model (LMM)", "Matched subspace detector (MSD)", "Target detection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hyperspectral target detection", "Hyperspectral unmixing", "Interaction effect", "Linear mixing models", "Matched Subspace Detectors", "Mixing models", "Multivariate statistics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017654301", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57191959427": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57191959427", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
