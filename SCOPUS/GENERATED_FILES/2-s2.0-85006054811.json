Worker bias is particularly difficult to evaluate and correct when many workers contribute just a few labels, a situation arising typically when labeling is crowd-sourced. In the scenario of labeling short videos of people facing a camera with personality traits, we evaluate the feasibility of the pairwise ranking method to alleviate bias problems. Workers are exposed to pairs of videos at a time and must order by preference. The variable levels are reconstructed by fitting a Bradley-Terry-Luce model with maximum likelihood. This method may at first sight, seem prohibitively expensive because for N videos, p = N(N \u2212 1)/2 pairs must be potentially processed by workers rather that N videos. However, by performing extensive simulations, we determine an empirical law for the scaling of the number of pairs needed as a function of the number of videos in order to achieve a given accuracy of score reconstruction and show that the pairwise method is affordable. We apply the method to the labeling of a large scale dataset of 10,000 videos used in the ChaLearn Apparent Personality Trait challenge.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bradley-Terry-Luce model", "Calibration of labels", "Continuous labels", "Crowd-sourced labels", "Label bias", "Ordinal labeling", "Personality traits", "Regression", "Variance models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calibration problems", "Continuous variables", "Extensive simulations", "Large-scale dataset", "Personality traits", "Ranking methods", "Regression", "Variance models"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006054811", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"22634035000": {"Name": "Escalera S.", "AuthorID": "22634035000", "AffiliationID": "114851983", "AffiliationName": "ChaLearn"}, "55867544400": {"Name": "Ponce-L\u00f3pez V.", "AuthorID": "55867544400", "AffiliationID": "60002581", "AffiliationName": "EIMT, Open University of Catalonia"}, "6603114322": {"Name": "Guyon I.", "AuthorID": "6603114322", "AffiliationID": "60106017", "AffiliationName": "University of Paris-Saclay"}, "55540987800": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "55540987800", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "University of California Berkeley"}, "35754109600": {"Name": "Shah N.", "AuthorID": "35754109600", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "University of California Berkeley"}, "57022810500": {"Name": "Sim\u00f3n M.", "AuthorID": "57022810500", "AffiliationID": "60002581", "AffiliationName": "EIMT, Open University of Catalonia"}}}
