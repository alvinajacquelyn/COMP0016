Our objective is to maximize the expected video distortion reduction of users, subject not only to encoding rate constraints, but also to complexity constraints. We prove that our optimization problem is a submodular maximization problem with two knapsack constraints. A weighted rate and complexity cost benefit greedy algorithm is then developed to obtain an approximate solution with polynomial time complexity and good approximation performance in simulations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["complexity-rate-distortion", "Dynamic adaptive video streaming", "rate control", "submodular function maximization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive video streaming", "Approximation performance", "Complexity constraints", "Dynamic-adaptive", "Polynomial time complexity", "Rate controls", "Rate distortions", "Submodular functions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011020107", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"36025559400": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "36025559400", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS4), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "24725809400": {"Name": "Toni L.", "AuthorID": "24725809400", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS4), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "7005865062": {"Name": "Frossard P.", "AuthorID": "7005865062", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Signal Processing Laboratory (LTS4), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "55617584700": {"Name": "Xiong H.", "AuthorID": "55617584700", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "8450421900": {"Name": "Zou J.", "AuthorID": "8450421900", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University"}}}
