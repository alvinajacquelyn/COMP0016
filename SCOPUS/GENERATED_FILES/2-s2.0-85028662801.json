Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody-drug conjugate licensed for use at relapse after autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) or following two prior therapies in those unsuitable for ASCT. There are limited data assessing the ability of BV to enable curative SCT. We performed a UK-wide retrospective study of 99 SCT-na\u00efve relapsed/refractory cHL. All had received 2 prior lines and were deemed fit for transplant but had an insufficient remission to proceed. The median age was 32 years. Most had nodular sclerosis subtype, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0\u20131 and advanced stage disease. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5\u00b76 months and median overall survival (OS) was 37\u00b72 months. The overall response rate was 56% (29% complete response; 27% partial response). 61% reached SCT: 34% immediately post-BV and 27% following an inadequate BV response but were salvaged and underwent deferred SCT. Patients consolidated with SCT had a superior PFS and OS to those not receiving SCT (P < 0\u00b7001). BV is an effective, non-toxic bridge to immediate SCT in 34% and deferred SCT in 27%. 39% never reached SCT with a PFS of 3\u00b70 months, demonstrating the unmet need to improve outcomes in those unsuitable for SCT post-BV.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brentuximab", "Hodgkin lymphoma", "transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Hodgkin Disease", "Humans", "Immunoconjugates", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Salvage Therapy", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Survival Analysis", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028662801", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"55496044000": {"Name": "Eyre T.A.", "AuthorID": "55496044000", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23024396800": {"Name": "Collins G.P.", "AuthorID": "23024396800", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56222694600": {"Name": "Phillips E.H.", "AuthorID": "56222694600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603239253": {"Name": "Ardeshna K.M.", "AuthorID": "6603239253", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "14119919500": {"Name": "Linton K.M.", "AuthorID": "14119919500", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie Hospital NHS Trust"}, "54929031600": {"Name": "Gibb A.", "AuthorID": "54929031600", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57188882102": {"Name": "Allibone S.", "AuthorID": "57188882102", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7102677703": {"Name": "Radford J.", "AuthorID": "7102677703", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, The Christie Hospital NHS Trust"}, "24464326400": {"Name": "Kassam S.", "AuthorID": "24464326400", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Kings College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Denmark Hill"}, "19433783800": {"Name": "Burton C.", "AuthorID": "19433783800", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57195530837": {"Name": "Stewart G.", "AuthorID": "57195530837", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57195530336": {"Name": "LeDieu R.", "AuthorID": "57195530336", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57195533279": {"Name": "Booth C.", "AuthorID": "57195533279", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7005020094": {"Name": "Osborne W.L.", "AuthorID": "7005020094", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12780218200": {"Name": "Miall F.", "AuthorID": "12780218200", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "36458191600": {"Name": "Eyre D.W.", "AuthorID": "36458191600", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}}}
