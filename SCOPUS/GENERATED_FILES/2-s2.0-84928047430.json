Methods By fitting simulation results from a multiregion tissue exchange model (Multiple path, Multiple tracer, Indicator Dilution, 4 region), the precision and accuracy of hemodynamic parameters in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with four tracer kinetic models is investigated. The impact of various injection rates as well as imprecise knowledge of the arterial input functions is examined. Results Fast injections are beneficial for Ktrans precision within the extended Tofts model and within the two-compartment exchange model but do not affect the other models under investigation. Biases from errors in the arterial input functions are mostly consistent in size and direction for the simple and the extended Tofts model, while they are hardly predictable for the other models. Errors in the hematocrit introduce the greatest loss in parameter accuracy, amounting to an average Ktrans bias of 40% for a 30% overestimation throughout all models. Conclusion This simulation study allows the detailed inspection of the isolated impact from various experimental conditions on parameter uncertainty. Because parameter uncertainty comparable to human studies was found, this study represents a validation of preclinical dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for modeling human tumor physiology.
