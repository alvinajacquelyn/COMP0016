Oxalic, succinic, and quinic acids, and adenine, inosine, and uridine were identified by HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS. Their anti-biofilm production and preformed biofilm disaggregation activities were studied using commercial standard compounds at different concentrations. As regards S. mutans, the highest activity was shown by adenine at 5 mg mL-1 both in the biofilm inhibition (BI 50%) and biofilm disaggregation tests (BD 20%). Considering A. naeslundii, BI values close to 80% were registered for oxalic acid at 1 mg mL-1 and 2 mg mL-1 and BD 50% for quinic acid at 3 mg mL-1. A weaker activity was found against P. intermedia. Furthermore, different mixtures of the commercial standards were tested showing that the activity of a compound can be strongly and sometimes negatively affected by the presence of the other compounds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biofilm inhibitions", "Commercial standards", "Disaggregation", "HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS", "Lentinus edodes", "Low molecular mass", "Quinic acids", "Streptococcus mutans", "Actinomyces", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Biofilms", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Dental Caries", "Gingivitis", "Humans", "Plant Extracts", "Prevotella intermedia", "Shiitake Mushrooms", "Streptococcus mutans", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048966394", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"]], "AuthorData": {"6603497119": {"Name": "Papetti A.", "AuthorID": "6603497119", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "6603759560": {"Name": "Gazzani G.", "AuthorID": "6603759560", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "6603884884": {"Name": "Signoretto C.", "AuthorID": "6603884884", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostics and Public Health, Section of Microbiology, University of Verona"}, "7004394482": {"Name": "Spratt D.A.", "AuthorID": "7004394482", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7004677911": {"Name": "Pratten J.", "AuthorID": "7004677911", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "55547112955": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "55547112955", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "55947511100": {"Name": "Lingstr\u00f6m P.", "AuthorID": "55947511100", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60012311, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cariology, Institute of Odontology at Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6506598679": {"Name": "Zaura E.", "AuthorID": "6506598679", "AffiliationID": "60014594, 60002483, 60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Dentistry, Academic Centre for Dentistry Amsterdam (ACTA), University of Amsterdam, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam"}, "7005362508": {"Name": "Ofek I.", "AuthorID": "7005362508", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "7004001571": {"Name": "Pruzzo C.", "AuthorID": "7004001571", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "DISTAV, University of Genoa"}}}
