Fully-nonlinear free-surface boundary conditions are considered. A local surface fitting method is used to calculate tangential derivatives. A shared-memory parallel procedure based on OpenMP is adopted for the efficiency improvement. Both 2D and 3D sloshing cases are studied. It is found that the second-order resonance may occur due to the interaction among natural frequencies and excitations frequencies. The second-order resonance becomes obvious after a sufficient long time length. After increasing the excitation amplitude, the second-order resonance emerges much earlier. For 3D situations, the second-order resonance in rectangular tanks with either equal or unequal length and width sides are investigated. The second-order resonances due to the interaction of two orthogonal plane waves in length and width directions are observed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary element method", "Fully nonlinear waves", "Second-order resonance", "Sloshing", "Three-dimensional tank"], "IndexKeywords": ["Efficiency improvement", "Excitation amplitudes", "Fully nonlinear", "Potential-flow theory", "Resonance problem", "Second orders", "Shared-memory parallels", "Three-dimensional tank"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928996484", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"56571698800": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "56571698800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56625766800": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56625766800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55816315400": {"Name": "Meng Q.", "AuthorID": "55816315400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
