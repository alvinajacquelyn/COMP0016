However, there is an inconsistency between study findings, suggesting the possibility of the influence of confounding factors. To examine the association between anthropometric traits and testicular germ cell tumour using an unbiased approach, we performed a Mendelian randomisation study. We used genotype data from genome wide association studies of testicular germ cell tumour totalling 5518 cases and 19,055 controls. Externally weighted polygenic risk scores were created and used to evaluate associations with testicular germ cell tumour risk per one standard deviation (s.d) increase in genetically-defined adult height, adult BMI, adult waist hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), adult hip circumference adjusted for BMI (HIPadjBMI), adult waist circumference adjusted for BMI (WCadjBMI), birth weight (BW) and childhood obesity. Mendelian randomisation analysis did not demonstrate an association between any anthropometric trait and testicular germ cell tumour risk. In particular, despite good power, there was no global evidence for association between height and testicular germ cell tumour. However, three SNPs for adult height individually showed association with testicular germ cell tumour (rs4624820: OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.41\u20131.55, p = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221257; rs12228415: OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.11\u20131.22, p = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u221210; rs7568069: OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.07\u20131.18, p = 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22126). This Mendelian randomisation analysis, based on the largest testicular germ cell tumour genome wide association dataset to date, does not support a causal etiological association between anthropometric traits and testicular germ cell tumour aetiology. Our findings are more compatible with confounding by shared environmental factors, possibly related to prenatal growth with exposure to these risk factors occurring in utero.", "AuthorKeywords": ["genome-wide association studies", "germ cell tumour", "growth", "height", "testicular cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Height", "Body Mass Index", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Statistical", "Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Random Allocation", "Risk Factors", "Testicular Neoplasms", "Waist-Hip Ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029432345", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57190050511": {"Name": "Levy M.", "AuthorID": "57190050511", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics & Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57193589895": {"Name": "Hall D.", "AuthorID": "57193589895", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics & Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56516491500": {"Name": "Sud A.", "AuthorID": "56516491500", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics & Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57155941900": {"Name": "Law P.", "AuthorID": "57155941900", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics & Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "56422214500": {"Name": "Litchfield K.", "AuthorID": "56422214500", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics & Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "12041127100": {"Name": "Dudakia D.", "AuthorID": "12041127100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics & Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57210017074": {"Name": "Houlston R.S.", "AuthorID": "57210017074", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics & Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "17347135900": {"Name": "Turnbull C.", "AuthorID": "17347135900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Trust"}, "7006331774": {"Name": "Haugen T.B.", "AuthorID": "7006331774", "AffiliationID": "60068730", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences"}, "57205457440": {"Name": "Karlsson R.", "AuthorID": "57205457440", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "6603952223": {"Name": "Wiklund F.", "AuthorID": "6603952223", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55249201700": {"Name": "Reid A.", "AuthorID": "55249201700", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Academic Radiotherapy Unit, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57202964141": {"Name": "Huddart R.A.", "AuthorID": "57202964141", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Academic Uro-oncology Unit, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003263171": {"Name": "Grotmol T.", "AuthorID": "7003263171", "AffiliationID": "60029133", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research, Cancer Registry of Norway"}}}
