It examines whether there is a specifically Cuban school of migration studies, analysing the nature and implications of Ortiz's concept of transculturation underpinning the postcolonial development of Cuban national identity. It further argues that, despite official Cuban claims regarding post-revolutionary racial equality, Arab migration has not only been historically and politically marginalized in accounts of the development of Cuban identity, including in Ortiz's own work, but diverse waves of Arab migration to the island have been characterized by what I refer to, following Derrida, as the accumulative footnoting of Islam. In conclusion, I argue that Muslim Arab immigration prior to the Cuban Revolution has been entirely overshadowed by a systematic focus on Christian Arabs, in effect leading to the category Arab being practically synonymous with Christian or Maronite, with wide-ranging implications for our understanding of Cuba's academic and political discourses regarding national identity in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947035949", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"34979810900": {"Name": "Fiddian-Qasmiyeh E.", "AuthorID": "34979810900", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, University College London"}}}
