The main idea is to detect faults by estimating model parameters, and monitoring the changes in residuals of model parameters. In the proposed methodology, a nonlinear dynamic model of wastewater treatment was discretized to algebraic equations using Euler's method. A parameter estimation problem was then formulated and transformed into a square system of parametric nonlinear algebraic equations by writing the optimality conditions. The parametric nonlinear algebraic equations were then solved symbolically to obtain the concentration of substrate in the inflow, Scin, inhibition coefficient, Ki, and specific growth rate, \u03bc0, as an explicit function of state variables (concentration of biomass, X; concentration of organic matter, Sc; concentration of dissolved oxygen, S0; and volume, V). The estimated model parameter values were compared with values from the normal operation. If the residual of model parameters exceeds a certain threshold value, a fault is detected. The application demonstrates the viability of the approach, and highlights its ability to detect faults in wastewater treatment systems by providing quick and accurate parameter estimates using the evaluation of explicit parametric functions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fault detection", "Multiparametric programming", "Parameter estimation", "Wastewater treatment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057878628", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"25655179600": {"Name": "Mid E.", "AuthorID": "25655179600", "AffiliationID": "60090652", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical Systems Engineering, University Malaysia Perlis"}, "7005602392": {"Name": "Dua V.", "AuthorID": "7005602392", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Centre of Process System Engineering (CPSE), University College London"}}}
