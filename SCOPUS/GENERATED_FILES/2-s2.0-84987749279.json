It lies next to the ARMS2/HTRA1 genes in a region of chromosome 10q26, where single nucleotide variants have been strongly associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the commonest cause of blindness in Western populations. Complement activation is thought to be a key factor in the pathogenesis of this condition. We sought to investigate whether DMBT1 CNV plays any role in the susceptibility to AMD. Methods: We analysed long-range linkage disequilibrium of DMBT1 CNV1 and CNV2 with flanking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using our previously published CNV and HapMap Phase 3 SNP data in the CEPH Europeans from Utah (CEU). We then typed a large cohort of 860 AMD patients and 419 examined age-matched controls for copy number at DMBT1 CNV1 and CNV2 and combined these data with copy numbers from a further 480 unexamined controls. Results: We found weak linkage disequilibrium between DMBT1 CNV1 and CNV2 with the SNPs rs1474526 and rs714816 in the HTRA1/ARMS2 region. By directly analysing copy number variation, we found no evidence of association of CNV1 or CNV2 with AMD. Conclusions: We have shown that copy number variation at DMBT1 does not affect risk of developing age-related macular degeneration and can therefore be ruled out from future studies investigating the association of structural variation at 10q26 with AMD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Case-Control Studies", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Gene Frequency", "Genotype", "Humans", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Macular Degeneration", "Odds Ratio", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proteins", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Serine Endopeptidases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987749279", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56611658900": {"Name": "Polley S.", "AuthorID": "56611658900", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester, Department of Genetics"}, "6602777968": {"Name": "Hollox E.J.", "AuthorID": "6602777968", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester, Department of Genetics"}, "23007919800": {"Name": "Cipriani V.", "AuthorID": "23007919800", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology UCSF Medical School"}, "57206944116": {"Name": "Yates J.R.W.", "AuthorID": "57206944116", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Medical Genetics"}, "10640292100": {"Name": "Khan J.C.", "AuthorID": "10640292100", "AffiliationID": "60030929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Royal Perth Hospital"}, "12775760100": {"Name": "Shahid H.", "AuthorID": "12775760100", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Ophthamology"}}}
