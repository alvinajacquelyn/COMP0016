All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.The effect of suspension stabilizers, internal aqueous phase volume and polymer amount were investigated for the production of protein loaded poly(d,llactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) microparticles suitable for pulmonary drug delivery. PLGA microparticles were produced adopting water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) solvent evaporation technique and were investigated for surface morphology, particle size, encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and in-vitro release profile. Porous surface morphologies with a narrow size distribution were observed when employing 0.5ml internal aqueous phase; 23.04\u03bcm (\u00b10.98), 15.05\u03bcm (\u00b10.27) and 22.89\u03bcm (\u00b10.41) for PVA, Tween 80 and oleic acid. Porous microparticles exhibited increased size and reduction in EE% with increasing internal aqueous phase, with non-porous microparticles produced when adopting 2.0ml internal aqueous phase. The selection of stabilizer influences the size of the pores formed thus offers potential for the aerodynamic properties of the microparticles to be manipulated to achieve suitable aerosolization characteristics for pulmonary delivery of proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inhalation", "Poly(d,l lactide-co-glycolide)", "Porous microspheres", "Solvent evaporation", "Water-in-oil-in-water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Inhalation", "Animals", "Cattle", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Lactic Acid", "Lung", "Microspheres", "Polyglycolic Acid", "Serum Albumin, Bovine", "Surface-Active Agents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925003418", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55206852500": {"Name": "Cocks E.", "AuthorID": "55206852500", "AffiliationID": "60017098", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, DeMontfort University"}, "7006524321": {"Name": "Alpar O.", "AuthorID": "7006524321", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8774245700": {"Name": "Somavarapu S.", "AuthorID": "8774245700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "16165949900": {"Name": "Greenleaf D.", "AuthorID": "16165949900", "AffiliationID": "60099132", "AffiliationName": "3M Healthcare Ltd"}}}
