Design: Participants heard target sentences spoken in a reverberant background of cafeteria noise and competing speech. Participants reported each sentence verbally. Eight participants also rated listening effort after each sentence. Sentence topic was either the same as, or different from, the previous target sentence. Study sample: Twenty participants with sensorineural hearing loss were fit binaurally with Signia receiver-in-the-canal hearing aids. Participants performed the task twice: once using the hearing aid\u2019s omnidirectional setting and once using the \u201cReverberant Room\u201d setting, designed to aid listening in reverberant environments. Results: Participants achieved better speech intelligibility for same-topic than different-topic sentences, and when they used the \u201cReverberant Room\u201d than the omnidirectional hearing-aid setting. Participants who rated effort showed a reliable reduction in listening effort for same-topic sentences and for the \u201cReverberant Room\u201d hearing-aid setting. The improvement in speech intelligibility from semantic context (i.e. same-topic compared to different-topic sentences) was greater than the improvement gained from changing hearing-aid setting. Conclusions: These findings highlight the enormous potential of cognitive (specifically, semantic) factors for improving speech intelligibility and reducing perceived listening effort in noise for hearing-aid users.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioural measures", "hearing aids", "Psychoacoustics/hearing science", "speech perception"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Auditory Threshold", "Female", "Hearing Aids", "Hearing Loss, Sensorineural", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Semantics", "Speech Intelligibility", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041529654", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57189340121": {"Name": "Holmes E.", "AuthorID": "57189340121", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Mind Institute, University of Western Ontario"}, "7004003478": {"Name": "Johnsrude I.S.", "AuthorID": "7004003478", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Western Ontario"}, "55503455900": {"Name": "Folkeard P.", "AuthorID": "55503455900", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Audiology, University of Western Ontario"}, "6602453065": {"Name": "Scollie S.", "AuthorID": "6602453065", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "School of Communication Sciences and Disorders, University of Western Ontario"}}}
