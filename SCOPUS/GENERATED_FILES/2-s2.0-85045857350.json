Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: A growing literature indicates that unipolar depression and bipolar depression are associated with alterations in grey matter volume. However, it is unclear to what degree these patterns of morphometric change reflect symptom dimensions. Here, we aimed to predict depressive symptoms and hypomanic symptoms based on patterns of grey matter volume using machine learning. Method: We used machine learning methods combined with voxel-based morphometry to predict depressive and self-reported hypomanic symptoms from grey matter volume in a sample of 47 individuals with unmedicated unipolar and bipolar depression. Results: We were able to predict depressive severity from grey matter volume in the anteroventral bilateral insula in both unipolar depression and bipolar depression. Self-reported hypomanic symptoms did not predict grey matter loss with a significant degree of accuracy. Discussion: The results of this study suggest that patterns of grey matter volume alteration in the insula are associated with depressive symptom severity across unipolar and bipolar depression. Studies using other modalities and exploring other brain regions with a larger sample are warranted to identify other systems that may be associated with depressive and hypomanic symptoms across affective disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bipolar disorder", "DARTEL", "depression", "Machine learning", "magnetic resonance imaging", "MRI", "VBM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bipolar Disorder", "Cerebral Cortex", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Severity of Illness Index", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045857350", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56368211000": {"Name": "Wise T.", "AuthorID": "56368211000", "AffiliationID": "60122566, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck, UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "43661514500": {"Name": "Marwood L.", "AuthorID": "43661514500", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, South London and Maudsley NSH Foundation Trust"}, "9635566700": {"Name": "Perkins A.M.", "AuthorID": "9635566700", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, South London and Maudsley NSH Foundation Trust"}, "56716227500": {"Name": "Herane-Vives A.", "AuthorID": "56716227500", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403881797": {"Name": "Young A.H.", "AuthorID": "7403881797", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7007175291": {"Name": "Cleare A.J.", "AuthorID": "7007175291", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56232237700": {"Name": "Arnone D.", "AuthorID": "56232237700", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202809259": {"Name": "Williams S.C.R.", "AuthorID": "57202809259", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
