We conducted a population-based analysis to compare diagnostic, treatment, and survival patterns. Methods: Data from cancer registries and administrative databases were linked for older patients with a diagnosis of NSCLC in England and the United States (2008\u20132012). We compared patient and clinical characteristics, as well as the distribution of age-standardized receipt of treatment by stage. We compared relative survival overall by stage and treatment. Finally, we assessed the degree to which stage distribution and stage-specific survival contributed to survival differences. Results: Among patients age 66 years or older with a diagnosis of NSCLC in England (n = 86,978) and the United States (n = 84,415), the rate of pathological confirmation was 63% in England compared with 85% in the United States (a 22.2% difference [99% confidence interval: 22.8%\u201321.7%]). The rate of receipt of active treatment was lower in England than in the United States (46% versus 60%, for a difference of 14.0% [99% confidence interval: 13.3%\u201314.7%]). In England, we identified 98 excess deaths per 1000 patients with pathologically confirmed NSCLC; these additional deaths could be partially mitigated by adjusting stage at diagnosis (reduction to 54 excess deaths) or stage-specific survival (reduction to 36 excess deaths). Conclusions: Compared with patients with NSCLC in the United States, patients with NSCLC in England are less likely to present with early-stage disease and receive treatment and are more likely to die. Future work should explore whether the intensity of resources directed to diagnostic and therapeutic activity may help mitigate disparities in outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer therapy", "Delivery of health care", "Health services for the aged", "Lung neoplasms", "Population registers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma of Lung", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Carcinoma, Large Cell", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Combined Modality Therapy", "England", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Services for the Aged", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Prognosis", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "Time Factors", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047140999", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"25633771200": {"Name": "Andreano A.", "AuthorID": "25633771200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7006062441": {"Name": "Valsecchi M.G.", "AuthorID": "7006062441", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milan-Bicocca"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57209325869": {"Name": "Peake M.D.", "AuthorID": "57209325869", "AffiliationID": "60033125, 60009171", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester, Glenfield Hospital"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute for Child Health"}, "57194794781": {"Name": "Hoag J.R.", "AuthorID": "57194794781", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Section of General Internal Medicine, Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center, Yale School of Medicine"}, "7402265354": {"Name": "Gross C.P.", "AuthorID": "7402265354", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Section of General Internal Medicine, Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center, Yale School of Medicine"}}}
