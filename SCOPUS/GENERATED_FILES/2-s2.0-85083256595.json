All rights reserved.Water-soluble vitamins play an essential catalytic role as coenzymes in crucial biochemical processes. Different from fat-soluble vitamins, they should be continuously supplied via diet since the human body is not capable of storing this vitamin group for a longer time. Moreover, they are distinct from other biomolecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in terms of molecular structure and metabolic purposes. Therefore processing methods should be carefully carried out in order to preserve vitamin content. These techniques, which mostly involve thermal processing or application of electric field or high hydrostatic pressures, have great influence on bioavailability and bioaccessibility of these vitamins and therefore should be efficiently optimized so as not to significantly alter these properties. Additionally, determination of these two critical properties plays a key role for further formulation of an efficient diet. However, factors such as age, gender, nutrient status, and health condition of individuals, such us genotype, pregnancy, lactation, or specific disorders, should be taken into account for the determination of bioavailability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioaccessibility", "Bioavailability", "Processing methods", "Water-soluble vitamins"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85083256595", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Professions (all)", "HEAL", "3600"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57203634349": {"Name": "Khaneghah A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203634349", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas"}, "55927243400": {"Name": "Hashemi S.M.B.", "AuthorID": "55927243400", "AffiliationID": "60109046", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Agriculture, Fasa University"}, "56242368900": {"Name": "Pourmohammadi K.", "AuthorID": "56242368900", "AffiliationID": "60109046", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science and Technology, College of Agriculture, Fasa University"}, "56507330400": {"Name": "Es I.", "AuthorID": "56507330400", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "16678760400": {"Name": "Gholamhosseinpour A.", "AuthorID": "16678760400", "AffiliationID": "60159403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science and Technology, Faculty of Agriculture, Jahrom University"}, "8568232600": {"Name": "Loizzo M.R.", "AuthorID": "8568232600", "AffiliationID": "60020261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Health and Nutritional Sciences, University of Calabria"}, "57205717698": {"Name": "Giardinieri A.", "AuthorID": "57205717698", "AffiliationID": "60031624", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural, Food, and Environmental Sciences, Polytechnic University of Marche"}, "9250536000": {"Name": "Pacetti D.", "AuthorID": "9250536000", "AffiliationID": "60031624", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural, Food, and Environmental Sciences, Polytechnic University of Marche"}, "35422098100": {"Name": "Ferreira D.S.", "AuthorID": "35422098100", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Technology, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas"}}}
