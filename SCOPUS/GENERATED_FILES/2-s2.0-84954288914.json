Better genetic understanding of this process forms the basis for personalized approaches to pharmacologic intervention that promises more successful therapeutics. Yet the vast diversity of cancer-promoting genetic changes along with the economic burden associated with the development of individualized therapies and corresponding diagnostic tools constitute a great challenge: to devise drugs that target a broad spectrum of cancers while minimizing unwanted effects. Thus better understanding the common characteristics that distinguish cancer cells from normal tissues is imperative for devising novel therapeutic strategies to complement \u201ctargeted\u201d treatments that focus on specific genetic events. Aberrations in cell cycle regulatory circuits underlie one such common feature of cancer cells, which is uncontrolled proliferation. During proliferation, accumulation of biomass for cell growth is the first discernable process preceding cell division. This occurs primarily during the G1 phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle before committing to a new round of DNA replication and ensures that sufficient nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids are available to build a functioning daughter cell. Thus highly proliferative cancer cells have an increased demand for biosynthetic processes to provide these building blocks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954288914", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"8585625000": {"Name": "Anastasiou D.", "AuthorID": "8585625000", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Division of Physiology and Metabolism, MRC National Institute for Medical Research"}, "57203234403": {"Name": "Locasale J.", "AuthorID": "57203234403", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nutritional Sciences, Cornell University"}, "6701856047": {"Name": "Vander Heiden M.", "AuthorID": "6701856047", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
