In addition to many of the regular participants, each meeting has also attracted a new group of scientists working in a fast-moving area of research. This themed section comprises both review articles and original research papers on nAChRs. Linked Articles: This article is part of a themed section on Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors.
