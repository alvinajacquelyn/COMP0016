To help us prevent accidents, a metric to determine the level of concentration of road accidents in a city could aid us to determine whether most of the accidents are constrained in a small number of places (hence, the environment plays a leading role) or whether accidents are dispersed over a city as a whole (hence, the driver has the biggest influence). Methods Here, we apply a new metric, the Rare Event Concentration Coefficient (RECC), to measure the concentration of road accidents based on a mixture model applied to the counts of road accidents over a discretised space. A test application of a tessellation of the space and mixture model is shown using two types of road accident data: an urban environment recorded in London between 2005 and 2014 and a motorway environment recorded in Mexico between 2015 and 2016. Findings In terms of their concentration, about 5% of the road junctions are the site of 50% of the accidents while around 80% of the road junctions expect close to zero accidents. Accidents which occur in regions with a high accident rate can be considered to have a strong component related to the environment and therefore changes, such as a road intervention or a change in the speed limit, might be introduced and their impact measured by changes to the RECC metric. This new procedure helps us identify regions with a high accident rate and determine whether the observed number of road accidents at a road junction has decreased over time and hence track structural changes in the road accident settings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accidents, Traffic", "Environment", "Humans", "London", "Mexico", "Models, Theoretical", "Spatial Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051409951", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191854613": {"Name": "Curiel R.", "AuthorID": "57191854613", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7202504799": {"Name": "Bishop S.", "AuthorID": "7202504799", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "57203355080": {"Name": "Ram\u00edrez H.", "AuthorID": "57203355080", "AffiliationID": "60108478, 60048669, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "LICIT Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon/ENTPE/IFFSTAR"}}}
