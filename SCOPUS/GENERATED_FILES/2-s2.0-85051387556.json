There are several strategies for obtaining cell-type and subcellular specific genome-wide data. We have developed a methodology, termed \u201cbiotagging\u201d that uses tissue-specific, genetically encoded components to biotinylate target proteins, enabling in depth genome-wide profiling in zebrafish. We have refined protocols to use the biotagging approach that led to enhanced isolation of coding and non-coding RNAs from ribosomes and nuclei of genetically defined cell-types. The ability to study both the actively translated and transcribed transcriptome in the same cell population, coupled to genomic accessibility assays has enabled the study of cell-type specific gene regulatory circuits in zebrafish due to the high signal-to-noise achieved via its stringent purification protocol. Here, we provide detailed methods to isolate, profile and analyze cell-type specific polyribosome and nuclear transcriptome in zebrafish.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell-type specific in vivo biotinylation", "Enhancer RNA", "Nuclear transcriptome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biotinylation", "Cell Fractionation", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Polyribosomes", "RNA", "Staining and Labeling", "Transcriptome", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051387556", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"35495555900": {"Name": "Trinh L.A.", "AuthorID": "35495555900", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "University of Southern California, Department of Biological Sciences, Molecular and Computational Biology, Translational Imaging Center"}, "57193878964": {"Name": "Chong-Morrison V.", "AuthorID": "57193878964", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60001633", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine"}, "6506693180": {"Name": "Sauka-Spengler T.", "AuthorID": "6506693180", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60001633", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine"}}}
