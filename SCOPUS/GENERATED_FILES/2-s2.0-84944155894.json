The focus is on the project manager as leader in an attempt to deepen understanding of the effect of a project manager\u2019s emotional intelligence (EI) on the quality of interpersonal communication with their followers, being other members of the project team. While a project manager\u2019s EI, with its associated emotional competencies, is often seen as critical in achieving good relationships with members of the project team, it remains a largely understudied concept, particularly in construction projects. Primary data collected using a series of analytical surveys and live observations of site-based project meetings was used to examine the relationship between a project manager\u2019s emotional competencies, particularly sensitivity and expressiveness, and leader\u2013follower chemistry. Overall, 68 construction professionals participated in the study. The findings suggest that a project manager\u2019s emotional sensitivity and expressiveness (particularly head gestures) may explain variance in the quality of leader\u2013follower chemistry. Based on the empirical evidence in the context of team communication, a leader\u2013follower chemistry model is introduced, which emphasizes the importance of leaders\u2019 emotional sensitivity and expressiveness in a leader\u2013follower communication dyad. The model may be particularly salient in complex project networks with a large number of prominent actors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Construction sector", "expressiveness", "leader\u2013follower chemistry", "project manager", "specific emotional ability approaches"], "IndexKeywords": ["Construction professionals", "Construction project managers", "Construction sectors", "Emotional abilities", "Emotional intelligence", "expressiveness", "Inter-personal communications", "Project managers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944155894", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"6603787961": {"Name": "Pryke S.", "AuthorID": "6603787961", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett, School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "56829552600": {"Name": "Lunic D.", "AuthorID": "56829552600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett, School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "56829337100": {"Name": "Badi S.", "AuthorID": "56829337100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett, School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}}}
