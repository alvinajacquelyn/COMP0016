We argue that these constructs have been systematically misrepresented in the literature, because of the conflation between the FEP and active inference, on the one hand, and distinct (albeit closely related) Bayesian formulations, centred on the brain \u2013 variously known as predictive processing, predictive coding or the prediction error minimisation framework. More specifically, we examine two contrasting interpretations of these models: a structural representationalist interpretation and an enactive interpretation. We argue that the structural representationalist interpretation of generative and recognition models does not do justice to the role that these constructs play in active inference under the FEP. We propose an enactive interpretation of active inference \u2013 what might be called enactive inference. In active inference under the FEP, the generative and recognition models are best cast as realising inference and control \u2013 the self-organising, belief-guided selection of action policies \u2013 and do not have the properties ascribed by structural representationalists.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active inference", "enactivism", "free-energy principle", "representationalism", "structural representations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070323156", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56986708800": {"Name": "Ramstead M.J.D.", "AuthorID": "56986708800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, McGill University"}, "53164060900": {"Name": "Kirchhoff M.D.", "AuthorID": "53164060900", "AffiliationID": "60011664", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, Faculty of Law, Humanities and the Arts, University of Wollongong"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
