All rights reserved.The field of interstitial lung disease (ILD) has undergone significant evolution in recent years, with an increasing incidence and more complex, ever expanding disease classification. In their most severe forms, these diseases lead to progressive loss of lung function, respiratory failure and eventually death. Despite notable advances, progress has been challenged by a poor understanding of pathological mechanisms and patient heterogeneity, including variable progression. The diagnostic pathway is thus being continually refined, with the introduction of tools such as transbronchial cryo lung biopsy and a move towards genetically aided, precision medicine. In this review, we focus on how to approach a patient with ILD and the diagnostic process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cryoscopic lung biopsy", "idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "interstitial lung disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biopsy", "Humans", "Lung Diseases, Interstitial"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013805340", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56223812700": {"Name": "Mikolasch T.A.", "AuthorID": "56223812700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London and Interstitial Lung Disease Service, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55497396500": {"Name": "Garthwaite H.S.", "AuthorID": "55497396500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London and Interstitial Lung Disease Service, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403426976": {"Name": "Porter J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403426976", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, University College London and Interstitial Lung Disease Service, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
