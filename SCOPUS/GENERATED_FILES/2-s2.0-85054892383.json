Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.The multispecies coalescent provides a natural framework for accommodating ancestral genetic polymorphism and coalescent processes that can cause different genomic regions to have different genealogical histories. The Bayesian program BPP includes a full-likelihood implementation of the multispecies coalescent, using transmodel Markov chain Monte Carlo to calculate the posterior probabilities of different species trees. BPP is suitable for analyzing multilocus sequence data sets and it accommodates the heterogeneity of gene trees (both the topology and branch lengths) among loci and gene tree uncertainties due to limited phylogenetic information at each locus. Here, we provide a practical guide to the use of BPP in species tree estimation. BPP is a command-line program that runs on LINUX, MACOSX, and WINDOWS. This protocol shows how to use both BPP 3.4 (http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/) and BPP 4.0 (https://github.com/bpp/).", "AuthorKeywords": ["BPP", "MCMC", "Multispecies coalescent", "Species tree inference"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bayes Theorem", "Genetic Techniques", "Humans", "Phylogeny", "Ranidae", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054892383", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"35203239100": {"Name": "Flouri T.", "AuthorID": "35203239100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57204191986": {"Name": "Jiao X.", "AuthorID": "57204191986", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "8148132700": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "8148132700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57204367074": {"Name": "Rannala B.", "AuthorID": "57204367074", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of California"}}}
