The aim of this study was therefore to analyse the association between sedentary behaviour (operationalised as daily TV viewing time) and levels of cortisol in hair (an objective measure of chronic stress) using data from a large population-based sample of older adults. Method: Analyses used cross-sectional data from older adults (\u226550 years) participating in Wave 6 (2012/13) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Hair cortisol concentrations were determined from the scalp\u2010nearest 2 cm hair segment. TV viewing time was self-reported and categorised as <2, 2 < 4, 4 < 6, or \u22656 h/day. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, education, wealth, limiting long-standing illness, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, body mass index, and depressive symptoms. Results: The sample comprised 3555 men and women, of whom 284 (8.0%) reported watching less than 2 h of TV per day, 1160 (32.6%) 2\u20134 h, 1079 (30.4%) 4\u20136 h, and 1032 (29.0%) \u22656 h. Mean hair cortisol concentrations for those spending <2, 2 < 4, 4 < 6, and \u22656 h per day watching TV were 0.862, 0.880, 0.889, and 0.934 log pg/mg, respectively. Differences between groups were not statistically significant in unadjusted (p =.088) or adjusted (p =.663) models. Conclusion: In a large sample of older adults in England, self-reported sedentary behaviour was not associated with a biomarker of chronic stress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hair cortisol", "Sedentary behaviour", "Stress", "TV viewing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068575456", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56503241000": {"Name": "Firth J.", "AuthorID": "56503241000", "AffiliationID": "60118837, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Youth Mental Health, University of Melbourne"}, "55965585000": {"Name": "Grabovac I.", "AuthorID": "55965585000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, Center for Public Health, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57197741912": {"Name": "Koyanagi A.", "AuthorID": "57197741912", "AffiliationID": "60104561, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60170475, 60000913", "AffiliationName": "Positive Ageing Research Institute, Faculty of Health, Social Care, Medicine and Education, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "36718206600": {"Name": "Soysal P.", "AuthorID": "36718206600", "AffiliationID": "60104413", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Bezmialem Vakif University, Faculty of Medicine"}, "57209738264": {"Name": "Willmott A.", "AuthorID": "57209738264", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Science, Anglia Ruskin University Cambridge"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Science, Anglia Ruskin University Cambridge"}, "57189045362": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57189045362", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Oncology and Community Health Sciences, University of Calgary"}}}
