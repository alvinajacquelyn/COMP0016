The system representation includes both model uncertainty and uncertain parameters. A finite time parameter estimator is developed. This facilitates the design of a finite time observer based on the well-established step-by-step sliding mode observer design approach. A terminal sliding mode control scheme is then developed using the corresponding state estimates. The methodology is applied to a continuous stirred tank reactor system to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptive state observer", "continuous stirred tank reactor", "Finite time stability", "parameter estimation", "terminal sliding mode control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive output feedback", "Adaptive state observer", "Continuous stirred tank reactor", "Finite time stability", "Second-order nonlinear systems", "Second-order systemss", "Sliding mode observers", "Terminal sliding mode control"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980385952", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"23112052400": {"Name": "Zhao D.", "AuthorID": "23112052400", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemical Engineering, China University of Petroleum"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}}}
