Here, we present all-optical rotational B-mode pulse-echo ultrasound imaging. With this device, ultrasound transmission and reception are performed with light. The all-optical transducer in the probe comprised an optical fibre that delivered pulsed excitation light to an optical head at the distal end with a multi-walled carbon nanotube and polydimethylsiloxane composite coating. This coating was photoacoustically excited to generate a highly directional ultrasound beam perpendicular to the optical fibre axis. A concave Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity at the distal end of an optical fibre, which was interrogated with a tuneable continuous-wave laser, served as an omnidirectional ultrasound receiver. The transmitted ultrasound had a \u22126 dB bandwidth of 31.3 MHz and a peak-to-peak pressure of 1.87 MPa, as measured at 1.5 mm from the probe. The receiver had a noise equivalent pressure <100 Pa over a 20 MHz bandwidth. With a maximum outer probe diameter of 1.25 mm, the probe provided imaging with an axial resolution better than 50 \u00b5m, and a real-time imaging rate of 5 frames per second. To investigate the capabilities of the probe, intraluminal imaging was performed in healthy swine carotid arteries. The results demonstrate that the all-optical probe is viable for clinical rotational ultrasound imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063950463", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56150220800": {"Name": "Colchester R.J.", "AuthorID": "56150220800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "56742945400": {"Name": "Dwyer G.", "AuthorID": "56742945400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57200169959": {"Name": "Alles E.J.", "AuthorID": "57200169959", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.Z.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London, Malet Place Engineering Building"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.C.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "34971090100": {"Name": "Finlay M.C.", "AuthorID": "34971090100", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Cardiovascular Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London and Barts Health Centre"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, University College London"}, "57214881494": {"Name": "Little C.", "AuthorID": "57214881494", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57193421069": {"Name": "Loder C.D.", "AuthorID": "57193421069", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6603035925": {"Name": "Rakhit R.D.", "AuthorID": "6603035925", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8306417100": {"Name": "Papakonstantinou I.", "AuthorID": "8306417100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Photonic Innovations Lab, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
