The persistence of this deleterious behaviour over years is reported in aetiologically heterogeneous samples to be between 60% and 80% but is unknown for TSC. Method: In this study, we determined the 3-year persistence of self-injury in a sample (n = 52) of children (with and without ID) and adults (with ID) with TSC and examined characteristics associated with persistence. Results: Findings for self-injury were contrasted to those for aggression and property destruction to examine the specificity of results to this behaviour. Self-injury was persistent in 84.6% of those with TSC who showed this behaviour, in contrast to 66.7% both for aggression and destruction. Persistent self-injury was associated with poor self-help skills, greater overactivity/impulsivity and more behavioural indicators of pain. These latter two characteristics were also associated with persistent aggression. No characteristics were associated with persistence of property destruction. Conclusion: These findings suggest that self-injurious behaviours in individuals with TSC, together with aggressive and destructive behaviours, are highly persistent and would benefit from targeted intervention. Poor adaptive skills, overactivity/impulsivity and painful health conditions may differentiate those at most risk for persistent self-injury or aggression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggression", "property destruction", "self-injury", "tuberous sclerosis associated neuropsychiatric disorders (TAND)", "tuberous sclerosis complex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aggression", "Comorbidity", "Female", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Problem Behavior", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Tuberous Sclerosis", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041691168", "SubjectAreas": [["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55746349400": {"Name": "Wilde L.", "AuthorID": "55746349400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "57200562111": {"Name": "Wade K.", "AuthorID": "57200562111", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "56865820000": {"Name": "Eden K.", "AuthorID": "56865820000", "AffiliationID": "109525841", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Community Health"}, "25652154200": {"Name": "Moss J.", "AuthorID": "25652154200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57203219218": {"Name": "Oliver C.", "AuthorID": "57203219218", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Cerebra Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "23766164600": {"Name": "de Vries P.", "AuthorID": "23766164600", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town"}}}
