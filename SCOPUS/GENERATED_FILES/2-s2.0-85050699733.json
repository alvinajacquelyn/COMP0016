Parent education appeared to have a positive impact on child safety seat use and children\u2019s bike helmet use, but results regarding the impact of parent education on pedestrian safety were mixed. The review highlighted important gaps in the literature. A key gap being identifying effective ways to engage parents of low socioeconomic and ethnic minority backgrounds. Further, another gap is understanding effective ways to engage and support parents of children with additional needs to build their children\u2019s road safety skills. There is some evidence that parent education has a positive impact on these \u201cat-risk\u201d groups, but little work on how to engage with these groups and the type of parent education required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children with SEND", "deprivation", "ethnicity", "Parent education", "road safety"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050699733", "SubjectAreas": [["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"]], "AuthorData": {"57203018218": {"Name": "O\u2019Toole S.", "AuthorID": "57203018218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department for Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}, "57210406972": {"Name": "Christie N.", "AuthorID": "57210406972", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department for Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}}}
