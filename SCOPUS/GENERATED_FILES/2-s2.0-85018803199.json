No studies, however, have directly compared these disorders to investigate common/distinct neural profiles underlying such abnormalities. We wanted to test whether reward-based decision-making is a shared transdiagnostic feature of both disorders with similar neurofunctional substrates or whether it is a shared phenotype with disorder-differential neurofunctional underpinnings. Methods Age and IQ-matched boys with ASD (N = 20), with OCD (N = 20) and 20 healthy controls, performed an individually-adjusted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) TD task. Brain activation and performance were compared between groups. Results Boys with ASD showed greater choice-impulsivity than OCD and control boys. Whole-brain between-group comparison revealed shared reductions in ASD and OCD relative to control boys for delayed-immediate choices in right ventromedial/lateral orbitofrontal cortex extending into medial/inferior prefrontal cortex, and in cerebellum, posterior cingulate and precuneus. For immediate-delayed choices, patients relative to controls showed reduced activation in anterior cingulate/ventromedial prefrontal cortex reaching into left caudate, which, at a trend level, was more decreased in ASD than OCD patients, and in bilateral temporal and inferior parietal regions. Conclusions This first fMRI comparison between youth with ASD and with OCD, using a reward-based decision-making task, shows predominantly shared neurofunctional abnormalities during TD in key ventromedial, orbital- and inferior fronto-striatal, temporo-parietal and cerebellar regions of temporal foresight and reward processing, suggesting trans-diagnostic neurofunctional deficits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ASD", "fMRI", "OCD", "temporal discounting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Brain Mapping", "Caudate Nucleus", "Cerebellum", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child", "Delay Discounting", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reward"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018803199", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55037261300": {"Name": "Carlisi C.O.", "AuthorID": "55037261300", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre"}, "57023384900": {"Name": "Norman L.", "AuthorID": "57023384900", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre"}, "7401764127": {"Name": "Murphy C.M.", "AuthorID": "7401764127", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Genetics Clinic, Adult Autism Service, Behavioural and Developmental Psychiatry Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley Foundation NHS Trust"}, "53363192200": {"Name": "Chantiluke K.", "AuthorID": "53363192200", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre"}, "6701327490": {"Name": "Rubia K.", "AuthorID": "6701327490", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry (SGDP) Centre"}, "7404062227": {"Name": "Murphy D.G.", "AuthorID": "7404062227", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Genetics Clinic, Adult Autism Service, Behavioural and Developmental Psychiatry Clinical Academic Group, South London and Maudsley Foundation NHS Trust"}, "6506130967": {"Name": "Christakou A.", "AuthorID": "6506130967", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "6602160284": {"Name": "Giampietro V.", "AuthorID": "6602160284", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College"}, "7101619950": {"Name": "Simmons A.", "AuthorID": "7101619950", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Center for Alzheimer Research, Division of Clinical Geriatrics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7006746119": {"Name": "Brammer M.", "AuthorID": "7006746119", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College"}, "7004084003": {"Name": "Mataix-Cols D.", "AuthorID": "7004084003", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Centre for Psychiatry Research, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
