Materials and methods Informed consent was waived for this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study. Fifty-nine men underwent PAC-MRI and ERC-MRI at 1.5 (n = 3) or 3 T (n = 56). On MRI images, two radiologists independently measured prostate volume and distances between the anterior rectal wall (ARW) and symphysis pubis at the level of the verumontanum; ARW and symphysis pubis at the level of the mid-symphysis pubis; and bladder neck and mid-symphysis pubis. Differences between measurements from PAC-MRI and ERC-MRI were assessed with the Wilcoxon RANK SUM test. Inter-reader agreement was assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Results Differences in prostate volume between PAC-MRI and ERC-MRI [median: -0.75 mm<sup>3</sup> (p = 0.10) and median: -0.84 mm<sup>3</sup> (p = 0.06) for readers 1 and 2, respectively] were not significant. For readers 1 and 2, median differences between distances were as follows: -10.20 and -12.75 mm, respectively, ARW to symphysis pubis at the level of the verumontanum; -6.60 and -6.08 mm, respectively, ARW to symphysis pubis at the level of the mid-symphysis pubis; -3 and -3 mm respectively, bladder neck to mid-symphysis pubis. All differences in distance were significant for both readers (p 0.0005). Distances were larger on PAC-MRI (p 0.0005). Inter-reader agreement regarding prostate volume was almost perfect on PAC-MRI (CCC: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.98-1.00) and ERC-MRI (CCC: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.99-1.00); inter-reader agreement for distance measurements varied (CCCs: 0.54-0.86). Conclusion Measurements of distances between anatomical landmarks differed significantly between ERC-MRI and PAC-MRI, although prostate volume measurements did not.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923385193", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6508189505": {"Name": "Mazaheri Y.", "AuthorID": "6508189505", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "38662206500": {"Name": "Afaq A.A.", "AuthorID": "38662206500", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57215840537": {"Name": "Jung S.I.", "AuthorID": "57215840537", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "21433884600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "21433884600", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57215469984": {"Name": "Aslan H.", "AuthorID": "57215469984", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "7005769802": {"Name": "Akin O.", "AuthorID": "7005769802", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "7103356975": {"Name": "Hricak H.", "AuthorID": "7103356975", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "7005738604": {"Name": "Zelefsky M.J.", "AuthorID": "7005738604", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}, "54397084800": {"Name": "Goldman D.A.", "AuthorID": "54397084800", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center"}}}
