Surface hydroxyapatite layer thickness/coverage from SEM images, Ca/Si ratio from EDX and hydroxyapatite Raman peak intensities were all proportional to both time in SBF and CaP wt.% in the filler. Hydroxyapatite was, however, difficult to detect by XRD until 4 weeks. XRD peak width and SEM images suggested this was due to the very small size (\u223c 10 nm) of the hydroxyapatite crystallites. Precipitate mass at 12 weeks was 22 wt.% of the sample CaP total mass irrespective of CaP wt.% and up to 7 wt.% of the specimen. Early diffusion controlled CHX release, assessed by UV spectrometry, was proportional to CaP and twice as fast in water compared with SBF. After 1 week, CHX continued to diffuse into water but in SBF, became entrapped within the precipitating hydroxyapatite layer. At 12 weeks CHX formed 5 to 15% of the HA layer with 10 to 40 wt.% CaP respectively. Despite linear decline of strength and modulus in 4 weeks from 160 to 101 MPa and 4 to 2.4 GPa, respectively, upon raising CaP content, all values were still within the range expected for commercial composites. The high strength, hydroxyapatite precipitation and surface antibacterial accumulation should reduce tooth restoration failure due to fracture, aid demineralised dentine repair and prevent subsurface carious disease respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibacterial", "Dental composite", "Hydroxyapatite precipitation", "Mono- and tricalcium phosphate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibacterial", "Diffusion controlled", "Hydroxyapatite crystallites", "Hydroxyapatite layers", "Hydroxyapatite precipitation", "Simulated body fluids", "Tri-calcium phosphates", "Urethane dimethacrylate", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Calcium Phosphates", "Composite Resins", "Durapatite", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948664371", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56674557900": {"Name": "Aljabo A.", "AuthorID": "56674557900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering Division"}, "12243558900": {"Name": "Abou Neel E.", "AuthorID": "12243558900", "AffiliationID": "60011568", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Tanta University"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering Division"}, "55506195900": {"Name": "Young A.", "AuthorID": "55506195900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering Division"}}}
