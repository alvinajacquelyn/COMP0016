Here we describe the outcome of pregnancies in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis at five centers in the United Kingdom using a retrospective case review of all women who became pregnant following diagnosis. We report 15 pregnancies in 13 women resulting in 15 live births including one twin pregnancy and 13 singleton pregnancies. One patient had an unplanned pregnancy and a first trimester miscarriage while taking methotrexate. All other pregnancies were planned following a minimum of 6 months clinical remission. Eleven successful pregnancies were delivered vaginally at full term, whereas three were delivered by cesarean section. All infants were healthy with no neonatal complications on their initial health check within the first 24 h of delivery and no evidence of neonatal vasculitis. One relapse occurred during pregnancy and was successfully treated with an increased dose of azathioprine and corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and plasma exchange therapy. One patient developed tracheal crusting and subglottic stenosis of infective etiology in the third trimester requiring tracheal debridement post delivery. No patient had a relapse in the first 12 months postpartum. Thus, successful pregnancy outcomes can occur following planned pregnancy in women in sustained remission on non-teratogenic therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ANCA", "Inflammation", "Vasculitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abortion, Spontaneous", "Adolescent", "Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Azathioprine", "Cesarean Section", "Cyclophosphamide", "Female", "Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Live Birth", "Methotrexate", "Microscopic Polyangiitis", "Plasma Exchange", "Preconception Care", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Pregnancy, High-Risk", "Pregnancy, Unplanned", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Term Birth", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926517384", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"7006943239": {"Name": "Croft A.P.", "AuthorID": "7006943239", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Immunobiology, School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham"}, "8922799500": {"Name": "Smith S.W.", "AuthorID": "8922799500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Immunobiology, School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham"}, "57195326404": {"Name": "Harper L.", "AuthorID": "57195326404", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Immunobiology, School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham"}, "8266079100": {"Name": "Morgan M.D.", "AuthorID": "8266079100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Immunobiology, School of Immunity and Infection, University of Birmingham"}, "56370935600": {"Name": "Carr S.", "AuthorID": "56370935600", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "56055882700": {"Name": "Youssouf S.", "AuthorID": "56055882700", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "55366513900": {"Name": "Salama A.D.", "AuthorID": "55366513900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "35472946900": {"Name": "Burns A.", "AuthorID": "35472946900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7006620861": {"Name": "Pusey C.D.", "AuthorID": "7006620861", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Campus"}, "55241522900": {"Name": "Hamilton P.", "AuthorID": "55241522900", "AffiliationID": "60030886", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Infirmary"}, "42060961700": {"Name": "Brown N.", "AuthorID": "42060961700", "AffiliationID": "60030886", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Infirmary"}, "7004152904": {"Name": "Venning M.", "AuthorID": "7004152904", "AffiliationID": "60030886", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Infirmary"}}}
