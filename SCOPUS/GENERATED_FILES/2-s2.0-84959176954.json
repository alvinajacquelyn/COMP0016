However, there is evidence from candidate gene research that indicates gene expression changes may be involved in antidepressant action. In this study, we examined antidepressant-induced alterations in gene expression on a transcriptome-wide scale, exploring associations with treatment response. Blood samples were taken from a subset of depressed patients from the GENDEP study (n=136) before and after eight weeks of treatment with either escitalopram or nortriptyline. Transcriptomic data were obtained from these samples using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip microarrays. When analysing individual genes, we observed that changes in the expression of two genes (MMP28 and KXD1) were associated with better response to nortriptyline. Considering connectivity between genes, we identified modules of genes that were highly coexpressed. In the whole sample, changes in one of the ten identified coexpression modules showed significant correlation with treatment response (cor=0.27, p=0.0029). Using transcriptomic approaches, we have identified gene expression correlates of the therapeutic effects of antidepressants, highlighting possible molecular pathways involved in efficacious antidepressant treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antidepressants", "Gene expression", "Genetics", "Major Depressive Disorder", "Pharmacogenetics", "Transcriptomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antidepressive Agents", "Carrier Proteins", "Citalopram", "Cohort Studies", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Europe", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Matrix Metalloproteinases, Secreted", "Microarray Analysis", "Nortriptyline", "Transcriptome", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959176954", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55257500600": {"Name": "Hodgson K.", "AuthorID": "55257500600", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "35171626800": {"Name": "Tansey K.E.", "AuthorID": "35171626800", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "55446272200": {"Name": "Powell T.R.", "AuthorID": "55446272200", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "57201919550": {"Name": "Uher R.", "AuthorID": "57201919550", "AffiliationID": "60023750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Dalhousie University"}, "7003415672": {"Name": "Aitchison K.J.", "AuthorID": "7003415672", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta"}, "7102548208": {"Name": "Craig I.W.", "AuthorID": "7102548208", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7102158824": {"Name": "Farmer A.E.", "AuthorID": "7102158824", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "15742166000": {"Name": "Breen G.", "AuthorID": "15742166000", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "57203252012": {"Name": "McGuffin P.", "AuthorID": "57203252012", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "57215104726": {"Name": "Coppola G.", "AuthorID": "57215104726", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Program in Neurogenetics, Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles"}, "56990016000": {"Name": "Zvezdana Dernov\u0161ek M.", "AuthorID": "56990016000", "AffiliationID": "112743284", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Clinic"}, "7004006411": {"Name": "Mors O.", "AuthorID": "7004006411", "AffiliationID": "60027906", "AffiliationName": "The Lundbeck Foundation Initiative for Integrated Psychiatric Research"}, "7202945962": {"Name": "Hauser J.", "AuthorID": "7202945962", "AffiliationID": "60069010", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Psychiatric Genetics, Department of Psychiatry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences"}, "7003619771": {"Name": "Souery D.", "AuthorID": "7003619771", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Psychologie M\u00e9dicale, Universite Libre de Bruxelles;
