Mosaic lineage tracing previously revealed that NRP1 is essential for tip cell function, although its mechanistic role in tip cells remains poorly defined. Here, we show that NRP1 is dispensable for genetic tip cell identity. Instead, we find that NRP1 is essential to form the filopodial bursts that distinguish tip cells morphologically from neighboring stalk cells, because it enables the extracellular matrix (ECM)-induced activation of CDC42, a key regulator of filopodia formation. Accordingly, NRP1 knockdown and pharmacological CDC42 inhibition similarly impaired filopodia formation in vitro and in developing zebrafish in vivo. During mouse retinal angiogenesis, CDC42 inhibition impaired tip cell and vascular network formation, causing defects that resembled those due to loss of ECM-induced, but not VEGF-induced, NRP1 signaling. We conclude that NRP1 enables ECM-induced filopodia formation for tip cell function during sprouting angiogenesis. During angiogenesis, new blood vessel sprouts are led by filopodia-studded tip cells to sense environmental signals and enable directional migration. NRP1 is a tip cell protein that senses angiogenic cues. Fantin et al. now show that NRP1 promotes tip cell function by enabling CDC42 activation for filopodia formation and actin remodeling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Endothelial Cells", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Neuropilin-1", "Pseudopodia", "Rhombencephalon", "Signal Transduction", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937639451", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"23007969000": {"Name": "Fantin A.", "AuthorID": "23007969000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "56192095000": {"Name": "Lampropoulou A.", "AuthorID": "56192095000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "25926118900": {"Name": "Raimondi C.", "AuthorID": "25926118900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57189718066": {"Name": "Senatore V.", "AuthorID": "57189718066", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602149137": {"Name": "Ruhrberg C.", "AuthorID": "6602149137", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6603766847": {"Name": "Gestri G.", "AuthorID": "6603766847", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7006463251": {"Name": "Zachary I.", "AuthorID": "7006463251", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
