In the extracellular space, recombinant Hsp27 has been described to exert anti-inflammatory activities. The aim of this study was to assess the association between circulating levels of Hsp27 and different types of periodontitis. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and the stress proteins Hsp27 and Hsp60 with proposed anti- and pro-inflammatory properties, respectively, were measured by two-site ELISA in the serum of patients with aggressive periodontitis (AgP, n = 30), chronic periodontitis (CP, n = 29) and periodontally healthy controls (H, n = 28). Furthermore, Hsp27 and Hsp60 levels were also measured longitudinally in 12 AgP patients at 6 time points up to 3 months after treatment. AgP patients had lower levels of Hsp27 compared to CP patients and healthy subjects (adjusted one-way ANOVA, p < 0.001, followed by post hoc Tukey HSD comparisons), while no differences in levels of Hsp60 or cytokines between the three groups were detected. In CP patients and H subjects, the systemic Hsp27 levels correlated with Hsp60 (r = 0.43, p < 0.001; r = 0.59, p < 0.001, respectively) and with pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 (r = 0.48, p < 0.001; r = 0.55, p < 0.001, respectively) and IL-6 (r = 0.44, p < 0.01). However, no such correlations were detected in AgP cases. No consistent temporal patterns of changes of Hsp27 concentration were detected across AgP patients following periodontal treatment. This study provides the first evidence that Hsp27 may be differentially expressed and regulated in AgP patients as compared with CP patients and healthy individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cytokines", "Hsp27", "Inflammation", "Periodontitis", "Stress proteins"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aggressive Periodontitis", "Case-Control Studies", "Chaperonin 60", "Chronic Periodontitis", "Cytokines", "Female", "HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondrial Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046886170", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7102610700": {"Name": "Kaiser F.", "AuthorID": "7102610700", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "57202559202": {"Name": "Henderson B.", "AuthorID": "57202559202", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "22953206000": {"Name": "Alagarswamy R.", "AuthorID": "22953206000", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology and Regenerative Medicine and Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London"}, "22835642700": {"Name": "Nibali L.", "AuthorID": "22835642700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology and Regenerative Medicine and Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London"}, "55340111100": {"Name": "Pelekos G.", "AuthorID": "55340111100", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Dentistry, The University of Hong Kong"}, "6602105898": {"Name": "Boniface D.", "AuthorID": "6602105898", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Unit, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
