This implies the necessity of using more advanced line-shape models which are characterized by many more parameters than a simple Voigt profile. It is a great challenge for modern molecular spectral databases to store and maintain the extended set of line-shape parameters as well as their temperature dependences. It is even more challenging to reliably retrieve these parameters from experimental spectra over a large range of pressures and temperatures. In this paper we address this problem starting from the case of the H2 molecule for which the non-Voigt line-shape effects are exceptionally pronounced. For this purpose we reanalyzed the experimental data reported in the literature. In particular, we performed detailed line-shape analysis of high-quality spectra obtained with cavity-enhanced techniques. We also report the first high-quality cavity-enhanced measurement of the H2 fundamental vibrational mode. We develop a correction to the Hartmann-Tran profile (HTP) which adjusts the HTP to the particular model of the velocity-changing collisions. This allows the measured spectra to be better represented over a wide range of pressures. The problem of storing the HTP parameters in the HITRAN database together with their temperature dependences is also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dicke narrowing", "HITRAN", "Molecular hydrogen", "Spectral line shapes", "Spectroscopic database", "Speed-dependent effects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dicke narrowing", "HITRAN", "Molecular hydrogen", "Spectral line shape", "Spectroscopic database", "Speed-dependent effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961916281", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"55587518700": {"Name": "Wcis\u0142o P.", "AuthorID": "55587518700", "AffiliationID": "60021858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Informatics, Nicolaus Copernicus University"}, "7201551593": {"Name": "Gordon I.E.", "AuthorID": "7201551593", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Atomic and Molecular Physics Division"}, "41262461100": {"Name": "Tan Y.", "AuthorID": "41262461100", "AffiliationID": "60089931, 60019118", "AffiliationName": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, iChem center, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7403559638": {"Name": "Hill C.", "AuthorID": "7403559638", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35345448200": {"Name": "Kochanov R.V.", "AuthorID": "35345448200", "AffiliationID": "60016896", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Quantum Mechanics of Molecules and Radiative Processes, Tomsk State University"}, "7006068957": {"Name": "Rothman L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006068957", "AffiliationID": "60020680", "AffiliationName": "Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Atomic and Molecular Physics Division"}, "13605446800": {"Name": "Tran H.", "AuthorID": "13605446800", "AffiliationID": "60122451, 60123796, 60019908, 60025066", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Inter-universitaire des Syst\u00e8mes Atmosph\u00e9riques (LISA), CNRS UMR 7583, Universit\u00e9 Paris Est Cr\u00e9teil, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace"}, "36126152800": {"Name": "Hu S.M.", "AuthorID": "36126152800", "AffiliationID": "60089931, 60019118", "AffiliationName": "Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale, iChem center, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7005480671": {"Name": "Campargue A.", "AuthorID": "7005480671", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, LIPhy"}, "6602332937": {"Name": "Kassi S.", "AuthorID": "6602332937", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, LIPhy"}, "7004166308": {"Name": "Romanini D.", "AuthorID": "7004166308", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, LIPhy"}}}
