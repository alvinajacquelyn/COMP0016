Several established and general methods for calculating the Helmholtz free energy across different length scales, including continuum, atomistic and quantum mechanical, are compared and analyzed. A computational approach is then proposed to calculate the temperature dependences of internal energy and absolute Helmholtz free energy for solid and liquid phases with the coupling of thermodynamic integration (TI) and harmonic approximation calculations from both classical molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT). We use the Lennard-Jones system as an example (i.e. argon) for the demonstration of the approach. It is observed that the free energy transits smoothly from being describable by the harmonic approximation to including anharmonic effects at a transition temperature around 0.56 Tm; below this temperature, the quantum behavior of atoms is important. At higher temperatures (T > 0.56 Tm), the TI and harmonic approximation results for the Helmholtz free energy functions become increasingly divergent with the increase of temperature. This work demonstrates that a multiscale approach employing TI, MD, and DFT can provide accurate calculations of the temperature dependence of absolute Helmholtz free energy for both solid and liquid phases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argon", "Harmonic approximation", "Helmholtz free energy", "Molecular dynamics", "Quantum mechanics", "Thermodynamic integration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classical molecular dynamics", "Computational approach", "Computational modelling", "Different length scale", "Harmonic approximation", "Multi-scale approaches", "Temperature dependence", "Thermodynamic integration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037522568", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"7404429179": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "7404429179", "AffiliationID": "60018926", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, San Diego State University"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "7004620955": {"Name": "Horsfield A.", "AuthorID": "7004620955", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "56771430300": {"Name": "Wearing D.", "AuthorID": "56771430300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}}}
