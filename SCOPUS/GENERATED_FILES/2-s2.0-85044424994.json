Whilst mechanochemical methods are solvent free and can therefore lead to improved sustainability metrics, it is more likely that the significant differences between reaction outcomes, reaction selectivities and reduced reaction times will make it a technique of interest to synthetic chemists. Herein, we provide an overview of mechanochemistry reaction examples, with 'direct' comparators to solvent based reactions, which collectively seemingly show that solid state grinding can lead to reduced reaction times, different reaction outcomes in product selectivity and in some instances different reaction products, including products not accessible in solution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Mechano-chemical methods", "Mechano-chemistry", "Mechanochemical reactions", "Molecular synthesis", "Product selectivities", "Reaction selectivity", "Sustainability metrics", "Synthetic chemists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044424994", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57190022638": {"Name": "Howard J.L.", "AuthorID": "57190022638", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "55765529300": {"Name": "Cao Q.", "AuthorID": "55765529300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.L.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}}}
