This primer set was designed to amplify alleles of small size to render it suitable for sex-typing degraded samples, including shed feathers. This marker successfully sex-typed 50 % of the species tested, including passerines, shorebirds, rails, seabirds, eagles and the brown kiwi Apteryx australis (allele size range =81\u2013103 bp), and is therefore expected to be suitable for sex-typing a wide range of species. Z37B sex-typed non-degraded samples (blood), degraded tissue (dead unhatched embryos, dead nestlings and museum specimens) and samples of low quantity DNA (plucked feathers and buccal swabs). The small amplicon sizes in birds suggest that this marker will be of utility for sex-typing feathers, swabs and degraded samples from a wide range of avian species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AVES", "Birds", "Degraded samples", "Feathers", "Non-invasive samples", "Sex-typing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928983856", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"34871764100": {"Name": "Dawson D.", "AuthorID": "34871764100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield"}, "55767088600": {"Name": "Dos Remedios N.", "AuthorID": "55767088600", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield"}, "8527999300": {"Name": "Horsburgh G.", "AuthorID": "8527999300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of Sheffield"}, "26667581200": {"Name": "Brekke P.", "AuthorID": "26667581200", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
