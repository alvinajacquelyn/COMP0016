Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.Aims: Excessive arterial pulsatility may contribute to cognitive decline and risk of dementia via damage to the fragile cerebral microcirculation. We hypothesized that the intensity of downstream-Travelling pulsatile waves measured by wave intensity analysis in the common carotid artery during mid-to late-life would be associated with subsequent cognitive decline. Methods and results: Duplex Doppler ultrasound was used to calculate peak forward-Travelling compression wave intensity (FCWI) within the common carotid artery in 3191 individuals [mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), age = 61 \u00b1 6 years; 75% male] assessed as part of the Whitehall II study in 2003-05. Serial measures of cognitive function were taken between 2002-04 and 2015-16. The relationship between FCWI and cognitive decline was adjusted for sociodemographic variables, genetic and health-related risk factors, and health behaviours. Mean (SD) 10-year change in standardized global cognitive score was-0.39 (0.18). Higher FCWI at baseline was associated with accelerated cognitive decline during follow-up [difference in 10-year change of global cognitive score per 1 SD higher FCWI =-0.02 (95% confidence interval-0.04 to-0.00); P = 0.03]. This association was largely driven by cognitive changes in individuals with the highest FCWI [Q4 vs. Q1-Q3 =-0.05 (-0.09 to-0.01), P = 0.01], equivalent to an age effect of 1.9 years. Compared to other participants, this group was \u223c50% more likely to exhibit cognitive decline (defined as the top 15% most rapid reductions in cognitive function during follow-up) even after adjustments for multiple potential confounding factors [odds ratio 1.49 (1.17-1.88)]. Conclusion: Elevated carotid artery wave intensity in mid-to late-life predicts faster cognitive decline in long-Term follow-up independent of other cardiovascular risk factors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular risk factors", "Cognitive decline", "Wave intensity", "Whitehall II study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Carotid Artery, Common", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Pulsatile Flow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070181200", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56190407900": {"Name": "Chiesa S.T.", "AuthorID": "56190407900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Cardiovascular Preventions and Outcomes, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57210724180": {"Name": "Masi S.", "AuthorID": "57210724180", "AffiliationID": "60032693, 60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Universit\u00e1 di Pisa"}, "23985899500": {"Name": "Patel R.S.", "AuthorID": "23985899500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Bart's Heart Centre"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.E.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Cardiovascular Preventions and Outcomes, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60112042, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U1153, Epidemiology of Ageing and Neurodegenerative Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, University of Paris"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivimaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "22955304900": {"Name": "Ellins E.A.", "AuthorID": "22955304900", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Life Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "6603008454": {"Name": "Halcox J.P.", "AuthorID": "6603008454", "AffiliationID": "60170471, 60004572", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Life Science, Swansea University Medical School, Swansea University"}, "7202046710": {"Name": "Fraser A.G.", "AuthorID": "7202046710", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Hospital of Wales"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "6603813816": {"Name": "Khir A.W.", "AuthorID": "6603813816", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Research Theme, Brunel University London"}, "7005533405": {"Name": "Celermajer D.S.", "AuthorID": "7005533405", "AffiliationID": "60018920", "AffiliationName": "Heart Research Institute"}}}
