Conventional fermentation methods have been well-studied since late 18th century, but are unable to achieve consumers' expectations regarding both quality and quantity. Therefore, novel technological developments of lactic acid production to increase yield and decrease over-all cost have become the primary goal. Genetic and metabolic engineering are great tools to overcome problems associated with product inhibition, undesired by-product formation, the negative effect of extreme culture conditions and most importantly inefficient use of expensive substrates. Adaptation of immobilization techniques to large-scale production can enhance fermentation yield. Moreover, improving novel techniques such as cell recycle systems, and simultaneous saccharification will lead engineered microorganisms to produce lactic acid with increased concentration, yield, and productivity. The present study reviews the viability and industrial potentiality of the most recent advances in the biotechnological production of lactic acid.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Engineered microorganisms", "Fermentation", "Lactic acid", "Large-scale"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biotechnological production", "By-product formation", "Fermentation yields", "Immobilization technique", "Lactic acid production", "Large scale productions", "Large-scale", "Technological development", "Bacteria", "Bioreactors", "Equipment Design", "Fermentation", "Genetic Engineering", "Genotype", "Industrial Microbiology", "Lactic Acid", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040356874", "SubjectAreas": [["Food Science", "AGRI", "1106"]], "AuthorData": {"56507330400": {"Name": "E\u015f I.", "AuthorID": "56507330400", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material and Bioprocess Engineering, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "57203634349": {"Name": "Mousavi Khaneghah A.", "AuthorID": "57203634349", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "57192073087": {"Name": "Sant'Ana A.", "AuthorID": "57192073087", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Food Science, Faculty of Food Engineering, University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "36190434200": {"Name": "Barba F.", "AuthorID": "36190434200", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition and Food Science Area, Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Sciences, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universitat de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "35583570500": {"Name": "Saraiva J.", "AuthorID": "35583570500", "AffiliationID": "60024825", "AffiliationName": "QOPNA, Departamento de Qu\u00edmica, Universidade de Aveiro"}, "55927243400": {"Name": "Hashemi S.", "AuthorID": "55927243400", "AffiliationID": "60109046", "AffiliationName": "Fasa University, College of Agriculture, Food Science and Technology Department"}}}
