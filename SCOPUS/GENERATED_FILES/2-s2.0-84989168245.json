However, this intriguing olivine material suffers from intrinsic sluggish kinetics of lithium (de-)insertion, which limits the reversible reaction in practical lithium cells. Herein we report a careful study of the impedance features of LiMnPO4during electrochemical reaction in lithium cell. The LiMnPO4material is prepared by sol-gel method and fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The material shows suitable galvanostatic cycling with a working voltage of about 4.1 V, which is higher than the 3.5 V value expected from the most common olivine material, i.e., LiFePO4. Hence, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to study the lithium (de-)insertion within the LiMnPO4structure. The results indicate an impedance behavior depending on the state of charge and a lithium diffusion coefficient trend slightly decreasing during cell operation within the 10\u221214\u2212 10\u221213cm2s\u22121range. The electrochemical study in lithium cell reveals remarkable enhancement of the electrode kinetics at 70 \u00b0C, which suggests preferred application of LiMnPO4materials at the higher temperatures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Battery", "Impedance spectroscopy", "LiMnPO4", "Lithium diffusion", "Olivine", "Sol-gel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Battery", "Electrochemical features", "Electrochemical reactions", "Electrochemical studies", "Environmental sustainability", "Impedance spectroscopy", "LiMnPO4", "Lithium diffusion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989168245", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56416532600": {"Name": "Di Lecce D.", "AuthorID": "56416532600", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Sapienza University of Rome, Chemistry Department"}, "55434250100": {"Name": "Hu T.", "AuthorID": "55434250100", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "University of Oulu, Research Unit of Sustainable Chemistry"}, "7102421480": {"Name": "Hassoun J.", "AuthorID": "7102421480", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}}}
