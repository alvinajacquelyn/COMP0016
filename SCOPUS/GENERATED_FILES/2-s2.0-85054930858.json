BCRs are generated through genetic recombination and can be diversified through somatic hypermutation (SHM) or class-switch recombination (CSR). Patterns of repertoire diversity can vary substantially between different health conditions. We use isotype-resolved BCR sequencing to compare B-cell evolution and class-switch fate in healthy individuals and in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We show that the patterns of SHM and CSR in B-cells from healthy individuals are distinct from CLL. We identify distinct properties of clonal expansion that lead to the generation of antibodies of different classes in healthy, malignant, and non-malignant CLL BCR repertoires. We further demonstrate that BCR diversity is affected by relationships between antibody variable and constant regions leading to isotype-specific signatures of variable gene usage. This study provides powerful insights into the mechanisms underlying the evolution of the adaptive immune responses in health and their aberration during disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B cells", "B-cell receptor seq", "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia", "Isotype switching", "Repertoire analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["B-Lymphocytes", "Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Class Switching", "Immunoglobulin Isotypes", "Immunoglobulin Joining Region", "Immunoglobulin Variable Region", "Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Multigene Family", "Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell", "Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054930858", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55662154300": {"Name": "Petrova V.N.", "AuthorID": "55662154300", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Sanger Institute"}, "7003332467": {"Name": "Vassiliou G.S.", "AuthorID": "7003332467", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Sanger Institute"}, "57206277316": {"Name": "Anderson C.A.", "AuthorID": "57206277316", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Sanger Institute"}, "56744480800": {"Name": "Muir L.", "AuthorID": "56744480800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London"}, "35936124200": {"Name": "McKay P.F.", "AuthorID": "35936124200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London"}, "56839023100": {"Name": "Kellam P.", "AuthorID": "56839023100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College London"}, "57203272915": {"Name": "Smith K.G.C.", "AuthorID": "57203272915", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "7102522977": {"Name": "Lyons P.A.", "AuthorID": "7102522977", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "55857130100": {"Name": "Bashford-Rogers R.J.M.", "AuthorID": "55857130100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "35278898300": {"Name": "Russell C.A.", "AuthorID": "35278898300", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}}}
