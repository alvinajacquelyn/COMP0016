We have identified a new conformational polymorph of 1 in which the two anthracene moieties are twisted out of plane by more than 60\u00b0. Occasionally, both the planar (1\u03b1) and twisted (1\u03b2) polymorphic forms crystallize out together representing a rare example of concomitant conformational polymorphism in a pure hydrocarbon. The two polymorphic forms also show distinctly different colours and morphologies - the planar form (1\u03b1) grows as long orange-red needles whereas the twisted form (1\u03b2) appears as yellow blocks. Furthermore, a variety of electronic structure-based calculations show that the planar molecule forms the more stable polymorph (1\u03b1), despite the conformation being close to the maximum in conformational energy. This may be attributed to 1\u03b1 being stabilized by greater intermolecular dispersion forces as the planar conformation allows a denser packing. The new polymorph (1\u03b2) is a long-lived metastable structure, because of the marked difference in crystal packing. Since the conformation in 1\u03b2 is more stable in isolation, and probably in solution state, this discovery raises questions about the control of crystallization of anthracene-based functional materials and the assumptions about conformational polymoprhism commonly made in crystal structure prediction studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84935025120", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56708035700": {"Name": "Goldstein R.", "AuthorID": "56708035700", "AffiliationID": "60005775", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Colby College"}, "56708035300": {"Name": "Hughes C.", "AuthorID": "56708035300", "AffiliationID": "60005775", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Colby College"}, "56708191500": {"Name": "Maurer D.", "AuthorID": "56708191500", "AffiliationID": "60005775", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Colby College"}, "57214242594": {"Name": "Newhouse T.", "AuthorID": "57214242594", "AffiliationID": "60005775", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Colby College"}, "53878563500": {"Name": "Sisto T.", "AuthorID": "53878563500", "AffiliationID": "60005775", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Colby College"}, "7004260801": {"Name": "Conry R.", "AuthorID": "7004260801", "AffiliationID": "60005775", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Colby College"}, "6603584978": {"Name": "Thamattoor D.", "AuthorID": "6603584978", "AffiliationID": "60005775", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Colby College"}, "36056622300": {"Name": "Guo R.", "AuthorID": "36056622300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202475468": {"Name": "Price S.", "AuthorID": "7202475468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
