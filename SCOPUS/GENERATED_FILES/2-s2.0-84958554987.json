We investigated the cerebral metabolic and haemodynamic changes following neonatal stroke in a term infant at 24 h of life. Changes in oxidation state of cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO) concentration were monitored along with changes in oxy- and deoxy- haemoglobin using a new broadband near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. Repeated transient changes in cerebral haemodynamics and metabolism were noted over a 3-h study period with decrease in oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2), deoxy haemoglobin (HHb) and oxCCO in both cerebral hemispheres without significant changes in systemic observations. A clear asymmetry was noted in the degree of change between the two cerebral hemispheres. Changes in cerebral oxygenation (measured as HbDiff=HbO2 -HHb) and cerebral metabolism (measured as oxCCO) were highly coupled on the injured side of the brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Broadband nirs", "Cerebral hemodynamics", "Cytochrome c oxidase", "Mitochondrial metabolism", "Neonatal stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Mitochondria", "Oxygen", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958554987", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"21135277300": {"Name": "Mitra S.", "AuthorID": "21135277300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "7102666483": {"Name": "Meek J.", "AuthorID": "7102666483", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "54906442400": {"Name": "Mathieson S.", "AuthorID": "54906442400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "57126234500": {"Name": "Uria C.", "AuthorID": "57126234500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "7006008708": {"Name": "Kendall G.", "AuthorID": "7006008708", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London and Neonatal Unit, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "56321585100": {"Name": "Bale G.", "AuthorID": "56321585100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
