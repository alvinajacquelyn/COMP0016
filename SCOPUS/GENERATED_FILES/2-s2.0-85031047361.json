The production of linear polyacrylate and polyacrylamide has been achieved via PET-RAFT polymerization using g-C3N4 as a photoactive organocatalyst without prior deoxygenation. The resulting polymers display controlled molecular weights, narrow polymer dispersities, and high end-group fidelity as exemplified by 1H NMR analysis, MALDI-TOF-MS measurement, and chain extension experiment. Temporal control is illustrated by intermittent light and dark cycles, with polymer growth arrested in the absence of irradiation. The effects of changing RAFT agents (i.e., trithiocarbonates), solvents, catalyst concentrations, and degrees of polymerization in this system have been investigated. The successful polymerization of nonpurified monomer (i.e., still containing radical inhibitors) demonstrates the robust nature of the presented PET-RAFT system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst concentration", "Controlled molecular weight", "Degrees of polymerizations", "End-group fidelities", "Graphitic carbon nitrides", "Intermittent light", "RAft polymerization", "Trithio carbonates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031047361", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57191522227": {"Name": "Fu Q.", "AuthorID": "57191522227", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Science Group, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "56430645900": {"Name": "McKenzie T.", "AuthorID": "56430645900", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Science Group, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "55750061300": {"Name": "Reyhani A.", "AuthorID": "55750061300", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Science Group, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "56446346700": {"Name": "Qiao G.", "AuthorID": "56446346700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Polymer Science Group, Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Melbourne"}, "57007819400": {"Name": "Ruan Q.", "AuthorID": "57007819400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Solar Energy and Advanced Materials Research Group, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Solar Energy and Advanced Materials Research Group, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
