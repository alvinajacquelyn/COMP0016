This application has been demonstrated with both well-folded (ubiquitin) and unfolded (\u03b1-synuclein) proteins alike. With this strategy, the experiments required for determining backbone chemical shifts can be performed very rapidly, i.e., in \u223c2 hours of spectrometer time, and this data can be used to calculate the backbone folds of proteins using well established algorithms. This will be of great value for structural proteomic investigations on one hand, where the speed of structure determination is a limiting factor and for application in the study of slow kinetic processes involving proteins, such as fibrillization, on the other hand.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fibrillization", "High-throughput analysis", "Kinetic process", "Multidimensional NMR", "NMR experiments", "Nonuniform sampling", "Short durations", "Structure determination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047261820", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57191826831": {"Name": "Rao Kakita V.", "AuthorID": "57191826831", "AffiliationID": "60025929, 60110654", "AffiliationName": "UM-DAE Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, University of Mumbai Kalina Campus"}, "57202135292": {"Name": "Kumar Shukla V.", "AuthorID": "57202135292", "AffiliationID": "60025929, 60110654", "AffiliationName": "UM-DAE Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, University of Mumbai Kalina Campus"}, "55386921700": {"Name": "Rachineni K.", "AuthorID": "55386921700", "AffiliationID": "60025929, 60110654", "AffiliationName": "UM-DAE Centre for Excellence in Basic Sciences, University of Mumbai Kalina Campus"}, "7007028995": {"Name": "Hosur R.", "AuthorID": "7007028995", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)"}, "57191826239": {"Name": "Bopardikar M.", "AuthorID": "57191826239", "AffiliationID": "60031855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR)"}, "55881359200": {"Name": "Ranjan P.", "AuthorID": "55881359200", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B)"}, "57129527200": {"Name": "Singh J.", "AuthorID": "57129527200", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B)"}}}
