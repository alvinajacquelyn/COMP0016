However, environmental actions and the natural material decaying are the most common processes that contribute for the loss of the physical-mechanical properties of the RC structures. When the bond between the concrete and the reinforcing rebar are affected, the results can be extremely dramatic and unpredicted. In this work, an optical fiber device for the monitoring of the bond-slip of old RC structures, where less intrusive techniques need to be considered, is proposed and tested. The sensor developed is based on the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology, inscribed in silica optical fiber. A pull-out test was carried out in a RC specimen, following the recommendations of the Annex D of the EN 10080. The results showed that the bond-slip optical sensors are capable to measure micro-displacements, with lower intrusiveness. Therefore, they can be used for monitoring the bond-slip of old RC structures as way of to collect information, essential to assist the owners to adopt cost effective, efficient and safer maintenance measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bond-slip", "FBG sensors", "heritage constructions", "optical fiber", "RC", "SHM"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064645942", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56536318300": {"Name": "Mesquita E.", "AuthorID": "56536318300", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "CONSTRUCT-LESE, Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto, Department of Civil Engineering"}, "12039997100": {"Name": "Melo J.", "AuthorID": "12039997100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "25645860800": {"Name": "Ar\u00eade A.", "AuthorID": "25645860800", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "CONSTRUCT-LESE, Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto, Department of Civil Engineering"}, "23135674700": {"Name": "Varum H.", "AuthorID": "23135674700", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "CONSTRUCT-LESE, Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto, Department of Civil Engineering"}, "32867457500": {"Name": "Antunes P.", "AuthorID": "32867457500", "AffiliationID": "60024825, 60171158, 60017375", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and I3N, University of Aveiro, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Campus de Santiago"}, "55950069600": {"Name": "Marques C.", "AuthorID": "55950069600", "AffiliationID": "60024825, 60171158, 60017375", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and I3N, University of Aveiro, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Campus de Santiago"}, "35106749800": {"Name": "Alberto N.", "AuthorID": "35106749800", "AffiliationID": "60017375", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Campus de Santiago"}, "35078108300": {"Name": "Andr\u00e9 P.S.", "AuthorID": "35078108300", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051, 60017375", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, University of Lisbon"}}}
