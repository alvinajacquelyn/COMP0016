The externally applied electric fields were found to be relatively weak vis-\u00e0-vis intrinsic electric fields computed in the interfacial regions, the magnitude of which varied from 1.8 V/\u00c5 toward bulklike water up to 4.5 V/\u00c5 at the interface. The molecular arrangement of the first hydration layer is determined fully by the surface structure of TiO2, where water is coordinated to unsaturated titanium atoms and/or interacting with exposed surface oxygen atoms. Moreover, the water dipoles tend to align with the strong intrinsic field. As a result, diffusion of water in this region was found to be by 1 order of magnitude lower than that of bulk water; application of an external electric field did not lead to a considerable change. In contrast to unperturbed diffusivity, a rather strong response of hydrogen-bond lifetime to the applied field was observed. The interfacial water is heavily confined, although the extent to which shows marked variation with specific surfaces; indeed, this environmental interplay has considerable effect on corresponding IR spectra in the interfacial-water region, and is affected by applied static fields.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion of water", "Dynamical properties", "External electric field", "Interfacial region", "Molecular arrangements", "Non equilibrium molecular dynamic (NEMD)", "Rutile and anatase", "Static electric fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986188721", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"32067636300": {"Name": "Futera Z.", "AuthorID": "32067636300", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, University College Dublin"}, "7004765766": {"Name": "English N.", "AuthorID": "7004765766", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, University College Dublin"}}}
