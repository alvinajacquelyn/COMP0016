It suggests a consideration of both professional and personal lives that makes a valuable contribution to work with older people. \u201cContexts\u201d, means the many different backgrounds and circumstances that inform lives, such as our gender, religion, sexuality, and age, to name a few. It is believed that the emotions that is experienced offers an important information and are used as a resource, but are often struggled with knowing to make best use of them as Eleanor did in his work with Enid and Bill. The idea of practising as outsider witnesses to older people\u2019s stories as one way encourages their sharing to be decentred, as well as using the practice of transparency. Decentred practice has encouraged the older person to focus and has ensured that sharing does not serve their personal agenda.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044948777", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"36441678800": {"Name": "Stott J.", "AuthorID": "36441678800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57211421968": {"Name": "Martin E.", "AuthorID": "57211421968", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
