Considering two important dynamics that influence consumers' purchase decisions regarding new technology products, consumer peer learning and incumbent reaction, we study the tactical-level time allocation decision with a simple game-theoretic model. We offer an economic rationale for the entrepreneur's optimal time allocation for different levels of consumer peer learning and incumbent reaction as well as different revenue distributions between the buyers, and we discuss theoretical and practical implications for technology entrepreneurship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Entrepreneurial selling", "game theory", "technology entrepreneurship", "time allocation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic scheduling", "Entrepreneurship", "Resource management", "Technology entrepreneurship", "Time allocation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028458812", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57195492766": {"Name": "Huang Y.", "AuthorID": "57195492766", "AffiliationID": "60003977", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Northwestern Polytechnical University"}, "57191479798": {"Name": "Yoo O.", "AuthorID": "57191479798", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}, "35751081800": {"Name": "Gokpinar B.", "AuthorID": "35751081800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}}}
