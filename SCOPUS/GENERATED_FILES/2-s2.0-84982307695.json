National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines recommends sequential testing with CA125 and routine ultrasound in primary care. However, these diagnostic tests have limited sensitivity or specificity. Improving accurate triage in women with vague symptoms is likely to improve mortality by streamlining referral and care pathways. The Refining Ovarian Cancer Test Accuracy Scores (ROCkeTS; HTA 13/13/01) project will derive and validate new tests/risk prediction models that estimate the probability of having OC in women with symptoms. This protocol refers to the prospective study only (phase III). Methods and analysis ROCkeTS comprises four parallel phases. The full ROCkeTS protocol can be found at http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/ROCKETS. Phase III is a prospective test accuracy study. The study will recruit 2450 patients from 15 UK sites. Recruited patients complete symptom and anxiety questionnaires, donate a serum sample and undergo ultrasound scored as per International Ovarian Tumour Analysis (IOTA) criteria. Recruitment is at rapid access clinics, emergency departments and elective clinics. Models to be evaluated include those based on ultrasound derived by the IOTA group and novel models derived from analysis of existing data sets. Estimates of sensitivity, specificity, c-statistic (area under receiver operating curve), positive predictive value and negative predictive value of diagnostic tests are evaluated and a calibration plot for models will be presented. ROCkeTS has received ethical approval from the NHS West Midlands REC (14/WM/1241) and is registered on the controlled trials website (ISRCTN17160843) and the National Institute of Health Research Cancer and Reproductive Health portfolios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gynaecology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "CA-125 Antigen", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Middle Aged", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Prospective Studies", "Research Design", "Risk Assessment", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Severity of Illness Index", "Ultrasonography", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982307695", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8875356000": {"Name": "Sundar S.", "AuthorID": "8875356000", "AffiliationID": "60007419", "AffiliationName": "Pan Birmingham Gynaecological Cancer Centre, City Hospital"}, "56567731400": {"Name": "Rai N.", "AuthorID": "56567731400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group, University of Birmingham"}, "57203104141": {"Name": "Kehoe S.", "AuthorID": "57203104141", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7003534063": {"Name": "Rick C.", "AuthorID": "7003534063", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "56189707700": {"Name": "Dowling F.", "AuthorID": "56189707700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "56397872600": {"Name": "Au P.", "AuthorID": "56397872600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "7006087510": {"Name": "Deeks J.", "AuthorID": "7006087510", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group, University of Birmingham"}, "56702291000": {"Name": "Snell K.", "AuthorID": "56702291000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group, University of Birmingham"}, "22957080900": {"Name": "Champaneria R.", "AuthorID": "22957080900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group, University of Birmingham"}, "7005925668": {"Name": "Davenport C.", "AuthorID": "7005925668", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group, University of Birmingham"}, "57189234864": {"Name": "Mallett S.", "AuthorID": "57189234864", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Test Accuracy Group, University of Birmingham"}, "56534010200": {"Name": "Stobart H.", "AuthorID": "56534010200", "AffiliationID": "118504992", "AffiliationName": "Patient Representative"}, "7102387447": {"Name": "Neal R.", "AuthorID": "7102387447", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care, Bangor University"}, "56001807000": {"Name": "Sutton A.", "AuthorID": "56001807000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics, University of Birmingham"}, "57206537061": {"Name": "Timmerman D.", "AuthorID": "57206537061", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, KU Leuven"}, "7006306227": {"Name": "Bourne T.", "AuthorID": "7006306227", "AffiliationID": "60018662, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, Imperial College"}, "22235804900": {"Name": "Van Calster B.", "AuthorID": "22235804900", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Development and Regeneration, KU Leuven"}, "16205135000": {"Name": "Gentry-Maharaj A.", "AuthorID": "16205135000", "AffiliationID": "113483397", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Women's Health"}, "55318584600": {"Name": "Menon U.", "AuthorID": "55318584600", "AffiliationID": "113483397", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, Gynaecological Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Women's Health"}}}
