We aimed to investigate the causes of screening failure at rest and on exercise to inform optimal S-ICD ECG vector development. Methods and Results - One hundred and thirty-one HCM patients (age, 50\u00b116 years; 92 males and 39 females) with \u22651 HCM risk factor for sudden death underwent S-ICD ECG screening at rest and on exercise. Fifty patients (38%) were ineligible for S-ICD because of screening failure in every lead vector: 33 (66%) failed in the supine position, 12 (24%) failed in the standing position, and 5 (10%) failed on exercise. In patients who could exercise and passed screening at rest, 31 (44%) had 1 vector safety, 16 (23%) had 2 vector safety, and 24 (33%) had 3 vector safety. Increased R:T wave ratio in the S-ICD screening ECG (odds ratio, 4.0; confidence interval, 3.0-5.3; P<0.001) was associated with screening failure, while R/T ratio <3 in aVF (odds ratio, 0.3; confidence interval, 0.12-0.69; P=0.006) and increasing age (odds ratio, 0.97; confidence interval, 0.95-0.99; P=0.03) was associated with reduced screening failure. European Society of Cardiology risk score was higher in those failing screening (risk score 5.5% [interquartile range, 3.2-8.7] in failed versus 4.5% [interquartile range, 2.9-7.4] in passed; P=0.04). Conclusions - HCM patients have a significant incidence of screening failure, which is determined primarily by the increased R:T ratio on the screening ECG and lead aVF. High-risk patients have an increased screening failure rate. Optimization of sensing algorithms is required to ensure that the highest risk HCM patients can benefit from S-ICD implantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["arrhythmia", "hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "S-ICD", "S-ICD screening", "sudden cardiac death"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Decision Support Techniques", "Defibrillators, Implantable", "Electric Countershock", "Electrocardiography", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Odds Ratio", "Patient Positioning", "Patient Selection", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Supine Position"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017646038", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56800023900": {"Name": "Srinivasan N.", "AuthorID": "56800023900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57193949748": {"Name": "Bac\u00e0 M.", "AuthorID": "57193949748", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Barts Heart Center, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "15769947600": {"Name": "Provid\u00eancia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Barts Heart Center, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57210507720": {"Name": "Patel K.", "AuthorID": "57210507720", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57193951969": {"Name": "Qamar K.", "AuthorID": "57193951969", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57193950596": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57193950596", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7202244843": {"Name": "Elliott P.", "AuthorID": "7202244843", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8786523100": {"Name": "Tome-Esteban M.", "AuthorID": "8786523100", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, St George's Hospital London"}}}
