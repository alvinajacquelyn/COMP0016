However, consumers are often unwilling to accept being price discriminated for fear that they would end up paying more for the same product or service. This article demonstrates that by rewarding consumers for disclosing personal information it is possible to achieve a situation where first-degree price discrimination is mutually advantageous and both buyers and sellers gain by adopting such a pricing model. The conditions required for this to happen are investigated and the impact on social welfare is discussed. Finally, the article considers the robustness of this model when consumers adopt an opportunistic behavior which consists in manipulating personal data in order to masquerade as a consumer with a lower willingness to pay.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital economy", "First-degree price discrimination", "Personal data", "Pricing models", "Privacy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027925760", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57204015802": {"Name": "Rayna T.", "AuthorID": "57204015802", "AffiliationID": "113133024", "AffiliationName": "Novancia Business School Paris"}, "54790534900": {"Name": "Darlington J.", "AuthorID": "54790534900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "18438913400": {"Name": "Striukova L.", "AuthorID": "18438913400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
