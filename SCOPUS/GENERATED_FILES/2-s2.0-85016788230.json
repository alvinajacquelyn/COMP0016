Primarily, it examines the relationship between sustainable buildings and occupiers, by summarising the key extant literature. Secondarily, the paper proposes avenues for future research relating to the impact of sustainability on corporate real estate strategy. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews over 90 relevant publications related to sustainability, real estate market responses and corporate real estate, focussing on the role and response of occupiers. The approach concentrates on occupier strategies, specifically considering influences such as corporate social responsibility (CSR), landlord\u2013tenant relationships, the changing occupier role and the \u201ccircle of blame\u201d. Findings: In recent years, literature has increasingly begun to reflect nuances in occupier responses to sustainable, prime, office real estate, with some conflicting findings as to the importance of sustainability. Location remains the dominant consideration in decision-making for occupiers, but sustainability is key to CSR and \u201cvalue-add\u201d in certain sectors. More effective use of sustainable buildings requires improved communication between landlord and tenant. The authors\u2019 review demonstrates that challenges still remain in relation to the \u201ccircle of blame\u201d. More research needs to be done in relation to the emergence of sustainability in the non-prime and retail sectors. Originality/value: Through collating key literature in this topical research area, the paper provides a critical review of occupier responses to sustainable real estate, and, therefore, a fuller understanding of emerging market practices. Additionally, it suggests future research directions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circle of blame", "CRE strategy", "Decision making", "Occupier perceptions", "Sustainable buildings", "Value add"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016788230", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Finance", "ECON", "2003"]], "AuthorData": {"41561772000": {"Name": "Livingstone N.", "AuthorID": "41561772000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "56223816200": {"Name": "Ferm J.", "AuthorID": "56223816200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
