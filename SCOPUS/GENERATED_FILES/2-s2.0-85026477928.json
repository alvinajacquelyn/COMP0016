Since 1949 there have been remarkable advances in radionuclide techniques and imaging equipment: from the first devices \"home-made\" in the many physics departments throughout the UK, to the sophisticated multimodality imagers now in everyday use in Nuclear Medicine. The BNMS has been instrumental in promoting the use of radionuclide techniques in the investigation of pathology by supporting and providing education, research and guidelines on the optimum use of radiation to help patients. The future of Nuclear Medicine is bright, thanks to improved imaging resolution, new radiopharmaceuticals, and new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026477928", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"7006132555": {"Name": "McCready R.", "AuthorID": "7006132555", "AffiliationID": "60012806", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Department, Royal Sussex County Hospital"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Department, Institute of Nuclear Medicine, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23469150700": {"Name": "Gnanasegaran G.", "AuthorID": "23469150700", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department Nuclear Medicine, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
