In this study we have combined novel in vivo imaging of cortical microvascular and mural cell architecture with mathematical modelling of blood flow and oxygen transport, to provide new insights into CBF regulation that would be inaccessible in a conventional experimental context. Our study indicates that vasoconstriction of smooth muscle actin-covered vessels, rather than pericyte-covered capillaries, induces stable reductions in downstream intravascular capillary and tissue oxygenation. We also propose that seemingly paradoxical observations in the literature around reduced blood velocity in response to arteriolar constrictions might be caused by a propagation of constrictions to upstream penetrating arterioles. We provide support for pericytes acting as signalling conduits for upstream smooth muscle activation, and erythrocyte deformation as a complementary regulatory mechanism. Finally, we caution against the use of blood velocity as a proxy measurement for flow. Our combined imaging-modelling platform complements conventional experimentation allowing cerebrovascular physiology to be probed in unprecedented detail.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actins", "Animals", "Brain", "Hemodynamics", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microvessels", "Models, Theoretical", "Optogenetics", "Oxygen", "Pericytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040986266", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57200371136": {"Name": "Sweeney P.W.", "AuthorID": "57200371136", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "24921854100": {"Name": "Shipley R.J.", "AuthorID": "24921854100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203674289": {"Name": "Walker-Samuel S.", "AuthorID": "57203674289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
