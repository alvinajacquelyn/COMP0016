How fat-rich diets promote progression from fatty liver to more damaging inflammatory and fibrotic stages is poorly understood. Here, we show that disrupting phosphorylation at Ser196 (S196A) in the liver X receptor alpha (LXR\u03b1, NR1H3) retards NAFLD progression in mice on a high-fat-high-cholesterol diet. Mechanistically, this is explained by key histone acetylation (H3K27) and transcriptional changes in pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory genes. Furthermore, S196A-LXR\u03b1 expression reveals the regulation of novel diet-specific LXR\u03b1-responsive genes, including the induction of Ces1f, implicated in the breakdown of hepatic lipids. This involves induced H3K27 acetylation and altered LXR and TBLR1 cofactor occupancy at the Ces1f gene in S196A fatty livers. Overall, impaired Ser196-LXR\u03b1 phosphorylation acts as a novel nutritional molecular sensor that profoundly alters the hepatic H3K27 acetylome and transcriptome during NAFLD progression placing LXR\u03b1 phosphorylation as an alternative anti-inflammatory or anti-fibrotic therapeutic target.\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsProgression to inflammatory and fibrotic steatohepatitis is poorly understood. Becares et al. reveal that disrupting LXR\u03b1 phosphorylation attenuates these processes by promoting a unique diet-induced transcriptome that prevents cholesterol accumulation and reduces hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanistically, phospho-deficient LXR\u03b1 promotes chromatin modifications and alters protein-protein interactions in differentially expressed genes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fibrosis", "inflammation", "lipid metabolism", "liver", "liver X receptor", "non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "phosphorylation", "transcription"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Dietary Fats", "Liver X Receptors", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Mutation, Missense", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Phosphorylation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060086784", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"37062922900": {"Name": "Becares N.", "AuthorID": "37062922900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "24830499600": {"Name": "Gage M.C.", "AuthorID": "24830499600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "57205460119": {"Name": "Martin-Gutierrez L.", "AuthorID": "57205460119", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "57202875127": {"Name": "Louie R.", "AuthorID": "57202875127", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "14527636000": {"Name": "Pourcet B.", "AuthorID": "14527636000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "11840220100": {"Name": "Pello O.M.", "AuthorID": "11840220100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "8505711300": {"Name": "O'Brien A.", "AuthorID": "8505711300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "7801465530": {"Name": "Pineda-Torra I.", "AuthorID": "7801465530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cardiometabolic Medicine, Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "55756261700": {"Name": "Voisin M.", "AuthorID": "55756261700", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "57189012340": {"Name": "Shrestha E.", "AuthorID": "57189012340", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "23488704900": {"Name": "Go\u00f1i S.", "AuthorID": "23488704900", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "35926758800": {"Name": "Garabedian M.J.", "AuthorID": "35926758800", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "56003681800": {"Name": "Liang N.", "AuthorID": "56003681800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institute, Centre for Innovative Medicine (CIMED), Department of Biosciences and Nutrition"}, "7004114620": {"Name": "Treuter E.", "AuthorID": "7004114620", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institute, Centre for Innovative Medicine (CIMED), Department of Biosciences and Nutrition"}, "54916621100": {"Name": "Luong T.V.", "AuthorID": "54916621100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8241424500": {"Name": "Pichardo-Almarza C.", "AuthorID": "8241424500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "23984658900": {"Name": "Diaz-Zuccarini V.", "AuthorID": "23984658900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55062253400": {"Name": "R\u00f8berg-Larsen H.", "AuthorID": "55062253400", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Oslo"}, "6603943805": {"Name": "Steffensen K.R.", "AuthorID": "6603943805", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institute"}, "6603058561": {"Name": "Rombouts K.", "AuthorID": "6603058561", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver & Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free"}}}
