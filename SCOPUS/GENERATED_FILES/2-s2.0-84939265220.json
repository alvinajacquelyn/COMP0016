The phase 2/3 SCOPE-1 trial assessed the effectiveness of CRT\u00b1cetuximab. The trial for the first time provided an opportunity to describe PROs from a multi-centre group of patients treated with CRT that are presented here. Methods: Patients undergoing CRT\u00b1cetuximab within the SCOPE-1 trial (258 patients from 36 UK centres) completed generic-, disease- and treatment-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-OES18, Dermatology Life-Quality Index (DLQI)) at baseline and at 7, 13, 24, 52 and 104 weeks. Mean EORTC functional scale scores (>15 point change significant), DLQI scores (>4 point change significant) and proportions of patients (>15% significant) with 'minimal' or 'severe' symptoms are presented. Results: Questionnaire response rates were good. At baseline, EORTC functional scores were high (>75%) and few symptoms were reported except for severe problems with fatigue, insomnia and eating-related symptoms (e.g., appetite loss, dysphagia, dry mouth) in both groups(>15%). Functional aspects of health deteriorated and symptoms increased with treatment and by week 13 global quality of life, physical, role and social function significantly deteriorated and more problems with fatigue, dyspnoea, appetite loss and trouble with taste were reported. Recovery occurred by 6 months (except severe fatigue and insomnia in >15% of patients) and maintained at follow-up with no differences between groups. Conclusions: CRT for localised oesophageal cancer has a significant detrimental impact on many aspects of HRQL; however, recovery is achieved by 6 months and maintained with the exception of persisting problems with severe fatigue and insomnia. The data suggest that the HRQL recovery after definitive CRT is quicker, and there is little lasting deficit compared with treatment including surgery. These data need to be compared with HRQL data from studies evaluating treatments including surgery for oesophageal cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "cetuximab", "chemoradiotherapy", "oesophgeal", "patient reported outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Patient Outcome Assessment", "Quality of Life", "Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939265220", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56366888600": {"Name": "Rees J.", "AuthorID": "56366888600", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Head and Neck, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003664999": {"Name": "Blazeby J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003664999", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Head and Neck, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003661646": {"Name": "Hurt C.N.", "AuthorID": "7003661646", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Wales Cancer Trials Unit, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "16220296400": {"Name": "Ray R.", "AuthorID": "16220296400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Wales Cancer Trials Unit, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "57191710144": {"Name": "Bashir N.", "AuthorID": "57191710144", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Wales Cancer Trials Unit, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "57208090758": {"Name": "Griffiths G.", "AuthorID": "57208090758", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "56781594400": {"Name": "SNixon L.", "AuthorID": "56781594400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Wales Cancer Trials Unit, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "6602512786": {"Name": "Gollins S.", "AuthorID": "6602512786", "AffiliationID": "60010389", "AffiliationName": "North Wales Cancer Treatment Centre, Glan Clwyd Hospital"}, "12902771600": {"Name": "Mukherjee S.", "AuthorID": "12902771600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Oxford University"}, "7004025232": {"Name": "Maughan T.", "AuthorID": "7004025232", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Oxford University"}, "57204301812": {"Name": "Falk S.J.", "AuthorID": "57204301812", "AffiliationID": "60024764, 60170515", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23499991300": {"Name": "Staffurth J.", "AuthorID": "23499991300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "56781593600": {"Name": "I Geh J.", "AuthorID": "56781593600", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre"}, "36071300500": {"Name": "Cunningham D.", "AuthorID": "36071300500", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402945503": {"Name": "Roy R.", "AuthorID": "7402945503", "AffiliationID": "60005954", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Centre for Oncology and Haematology, Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Trust"}, "7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7004174644": {"Name": "Crosby T.", "AuthorID": "7004174644", "AffiliationID": "60016901", "AffiliationName": "Velindre Cancer Centre, Velindre Hospital"}}}
