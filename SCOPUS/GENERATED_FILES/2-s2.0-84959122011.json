KGaA, Weinheim.Stimuli-responsive nanoprobes that combine both fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are anticipated to be highly beneficial for tumor visualization with high imaging sensitivity. By employing an interfacial templating scheme, a pH-activatable fluorescence/MRI dual-modality imaging nanoprobe is successfully developed based on the coencapsulation of MnO nanoparticles and coumarin-545T inside a hybrid silica nanoshell. To promote cancer cell targeting with high-specificity, the nanoprobes are also conjugated with folic acid to establish a greater affinity for cancer cells that over-express folate receptors on their cell membrane. In the new nanosystem, MnO nanoparticles are shown to function as an efficient fluorescence quencher of coumarin-545T prior to cellular uptake. However, fluorescence recovery is achieved upon acidic dissolution of the MnO nanoparticles following receptor-mediated endocytosis into the low pH compartments of the cancer cells. Meanwhile, the Mn2+ ions thus released are also shown to exert a strong T1 contrast enhancement in the cancer cells. Therefore, by demonstrating the dual-activatable MRI and fluorescence imaging in response to the low pH conditions, it is envisioned that these nanoprobes would have tremendous potential for emerging cancer-imaging modalities such as image-guided cancer therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer imaging", "Coumarin", "Manganese oxide", "MRI", "PH-responsive"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cancer cell targeting", "Cancer imaging", "Coumarin", "Dual-modality imaging", "Fluorescence quenchers", "Fluorescence recovery", "PH-responsive", "Receptor-mediated endocytosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Contrast Media", "Coumarins", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Manganese Compounds", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Neoplasms", "Oxides", "Particle Size", "Silicon Dioxide", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959122011", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"55522343300": {"Name": "Hsu B.Y.W.", "AuthorID": "55522343300", "AffiliationID": "60106371, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "NUS Graduate School for Integrative Sciences and Engineering, National University of Singapore"}, "56331098900": {"Name": "Ng M.", "AuthorID": "56331098900", "AffiliationID": "60095069, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Translational Molecular Imaging Group, Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR)"}, "6701750080": {"Name": "Bhakoo K.", "AuthorID": "6701750080", "AffiliationID": "60095069, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Translational Molecular Imaging Group, Singapore Bioimaging Consortium, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR)"}, "36931163300": {"Name": "Tan A.", "AuthorID": "36931163300", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Laboratory, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "55961871300": {"Name": "Connell J.", "AuthorID": "55961871300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "55875686000": {"Name": "Roberts T.", "AuthorID": "55875686000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London"}, "57214252991": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57214252991", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR)"}, "12243373900": {"Name": "Wong S.Y.", "AuthorID": "12243373900", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR)"}, "55523051700": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "55523051700", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR)"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57202278184": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57202278184", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore"}}}
