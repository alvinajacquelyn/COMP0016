We aimed to compare illness perceptions of relatives of patients with FNSDs with those held by patients themselves. We used control pairs with neurological diseases (NDs) to examine the specificity of the findings to FNSDs. Material and methods: Patients with FNSDs (functional limb weakness and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures) and patients with NDs causing limb weakness and epilepsy, as well as their relatives, completed adapted versions of the Illness Perception Questionnaire - Revised (IPQ-R). Results: We included 112 pairs of patients with FNSDs and their relatives and 60 pairs of patients with NDs and their relatives. Relatives of patients with FNSDs were more likely to endorse psychological explanations and, in particular, stress as causal factors than patients with FNSDs (p. <.001). Relatives of patients with FNSDs were also more pessimistic about the expected duration of the disorder and perceived a greater emotional impact compared with patients themselves (p. <.001). However, the latter two differences between patients and relatives were also found in pairs of patients with NDs and their relatives. Conclusion: The main difference in illness perceptions between relatives and patients that appeared specific to FNSDs was a tendency for relatives to see psychological factors as more relevant compared with patients. Some other differences were observed between pairs of patients with FNSDs and their relatives, but the same differences were also seen in pairs of patients with NDs and their relatives. These other differences were, therefore, not specific to FNSDs. Discussion about possibly relevant psychological factors with patients suffering from FNSDs may be helped by including relatives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conversion disorder", "Epilepsy", "Functional weakness", "Illness perception", "Neurology", "Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Adult", "Attitude to Health", "Attitude to Health", "Family", "Family", "Female", "Female", "Humans", "Humans", "Male", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Middle Aged", "Muscle Weakness", "Muscle Weakness", "Nervous System Diseases", "Nervous System Diseases", "Seizures", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919908863", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"37121242300": {"Name": "Whitehead K.", "AuthorID": "37121242300", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "7403061220": {"Name": "Stone J.", "AuthorID": "7403061220", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60013999", "AffiliationName": "Dept Clinical Neurosciences, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital"}, "15832436500": {"Name": "Norman P.", "AuthorID": "15832436500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield"}, "55669000100": {"Name": "Sharpe M.", "AuthorID": "55669000100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7102183040": {"Name": "Reuber M.", "AuthorID": "7102183040", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60006444", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neurology Unit, University of Sheffield, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}}}
