Mutations in PARK7, encoding DJ-1, are associated with early-onset familial Parkinson\u2019s disease and lead to pathological oxidative stress and/or disrupted protein degradation by the proteasome. The aim of this study was to gain insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of selected DJ-1 missense mutations, by characterizing protein\u2013protein interactions, core parameters of mitochondrial function, quality control regulation via autophagy, and cellular death following dopamine accumulation. We report that the DJ-1M26I mutant influences DJ-1 interactions with SUMO-1, in turn enhancing removal of mitochondria and conferring increased cellular susceptibility to dopamine toxicity. By contrast, the DJ-1D149A mutant does not influence mitophagy, but instead impairs Ca2+ dynamics and free radical homeostasis by disrupting DJ-1 interactions with a mitochondrial accessory protein known as DJ-1-binding protein (DJBP/EFCAB6). Thus, individual DJ-1 mutations have different effects on mitochondrial function and quality control, implying mutation-specific pathomechanisms converging on impaired mitochondrial homeostasis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DJ-1", "DJBP/EFCAB6", "Mitochondria", "Mitophagy", "PARK7", "SUMO-1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046889745", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56423685000": {"Name": "Strobbe D.", "AuthorID": "56423685000", "AffiliationID": "60014262", "AffiliationName": "Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"}, "56260347400": {"Name": "Rossi L.", "AuthorID": "56260347400", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "55558532500": {"Name": "Ferraina C.", "AuthorID": "55558532500", "AffiliationID": "60014262", "AffiliationName": "Regina Elena National Cancer Institute"}, "6603183238": {"Name": "Rodolfo C.", "AuthorID": "6603183238", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "7003987654": {"Name": "Campanella M.", "AuthorID": "7003987654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Consortium for Mitochondrial Research"}, "57220802387": {"Name": "Robinson A.A.", "AuthorID": "57220802387", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7102029918": {"Name": "Harvey K.", "AuthorID": "7102029918", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55199584800": {"Name": "De Biase V.", "AuthorID": "55199584800", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "57203196300": {"Name": "Harvey R.J.", "AuthorID": "57203196300", "AffiliationID": "60159369", "AffiliationName": "Sunshine Coast Health Institute"}}}
