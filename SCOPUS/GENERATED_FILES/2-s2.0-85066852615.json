We report a detailed structural and optical study and the observation of lasing for a mixed group-V GaAsP NW with GaAs QWs. This system offers a number of potential advantages in comparison to previously studied common group-V structures (e.g., AlGaAs/GaAs) including highly strained binary GaAs QWs, the absence of a lower band gap core region, and deep carrier potential wells. Despite the large lattice mismatch (\u223c1.7%), it is possible to grow defect-free GaAs coaxial QWs with high optical quality. The large band gap difference results in strong carrier confinement, and the ability to apply a high degree of compressive strain to the GaAs QWs is also expected to be beneficial for laser performance. For a non-fully optimized structure containing three QWs, we achieve low-temperature lasing with a low external (internal) threshold of 20 (0.9) \u03bcJ/cm2/pulse. In addition, a very narrow lasing line width of \u223c0.15 nm is observed. These results extend the NW laser structure to coaxial III-V-V QWs, which are highly suitable as the platform for NW emitters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carrier collection", "carrier confinement", "III-V-V", "laser", "nanowire", "quantum well"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier collection", "Carrier confinements", "Coaxial nanowires", "Compressive strain", "Large lattice mismatch", "Laser performance", "Optical qualities", "Optimized structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066852615", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"37017831000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "37017831000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57209204186": {"Name": "Davis G.", "AuthorID": "57209204186", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Photon Science Institute, University of Sheffield"}, "57217777375": {"Name": "Velichko A.", "AuthorID": "57217777375", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Photon Science Institute, University of Sheffield"}, "36149946900": {"Name": "Godde T.", "AuthorID": "36149946900", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Photon Science Institute, University of Sheffield"}, "7004995703": {"Name": "Mowbray D.J.", "AuthorID": "7004995703", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Photon Science Institute, University of Sheffield"}, "55635913700": {"Name": "Fonseka H.A.", "AuthorID": "55635913700", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "57195331675": {"Name": "Gott J.A.", "AuthorID": "57195331675", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "56946096400": {"Name": "Sanchez A.M.", "AuthorID": "56946096400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "34770654200": {"Name": "Gustafsson A.", "AuthorID": "34770654200", "AffiliationID": "60118983, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Solid State Physics and NanoLund, Lund University"}, "55386833000": {"Name": "Saxena D.", "AuthorID": "55386833000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Blackett Laboratory, Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "12787101800": {"Name": "Aagesen M.", "AuthorID": "12787101800", "AffiliationID": "60083705", "AffiliationName": "Danish Defence Research Center"}, "7003554588": {"Name": "Parkinson P.W.", "AuthorID": "7003554588", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Photon Science Institute, University of Manchester"}, "56328022900": {"Name": "Huo S.", "AuthorID": "56328022900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
