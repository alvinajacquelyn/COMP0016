However for interventional use they suffer from drawbacks which limit their application. Freehand SPECT was developed to provide 3D functional imaging during interventions. It combines a nuclear detector with an optical tracking system to obtain its position and orientation in space and synchronizes this with the detector readings. This information can be used to compute a 3D tomographic reconstruction of an activity distribution of a nuclear tracer. As there is no fixed geometry, the system matrix has to be computed on the fly. This is done with models of the detection process for completely arbitrary freehand acquisitions. The accuracy of the reconstructions is highly dependent on the used models of the detection process. Different models of the detection process were developed and evaluated in this work, in particular two analytical models as well as lookup tablesgenerated from either real measurements or Monte Carlo simulations. We showed that it is possible to perform acceptable reconstructions with a simple but efficient analytical model. The use of lookup tablesto generate the system matrix in Freehand SPECT is a fast solution with good accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computer assisted surgery", "gamma probe", "guidance", "intra operative", "navigation", "nuclear medicine", "reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D tomographic reconstruction", "Activity distribution", "Computer assisted surgery", "Detection process", "Functional imaging", "Intra-operative", "Optical tracking systems", "Position and orientations", "Algorithms", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Monte Carlo Method", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921033946", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57197552355": {"Name": "Hartl A.", "AuthorID": "57197552355", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Department, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "38562092100": {"Name": "Shakir D.", "AuthorID": "38562092100", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Department, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "23467408900": {"Name": "Lasser T.", "AuthorID": "23467408900", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "7003458998": {"Name": "Navab N.", "AuthorID": "7003458998", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP), Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "35429957100": {"Name": "Ziegler S.", "AuthorID": "35429957100", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Department, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}}}
