Here we set out to raise awareness of subacute degeneration of the spinal cord arising from recreational N2O use so that formal surveillance programs and public health interventions can be designed. Methods: Case series documenting the clinical and investigational features of ten consecutive cases of subacute degeneration of the spinal cord presenting to a hospital with a tertiary neurosciences service in East London. Results: Sensory disturbance in the lower (\u00b1 upper) limbs was the commonest presenting feature, along with gait abnormalities and sensory ataxia. MRI imaging of the spine showed the characteristic features of dorsal column hyperintensity on T2 weighted sequences. Serum B12 levels may be normal because subacute degeneration of the spinal cord in this situation is triggered by functional rather than absolute B12 deficiency. Discussion: A high index of suspicion is required to prompt appropriate investigation, make the diagnosis and commence treatment early. This is the largest reported series of patients with subacute degeneration of the spinal cord induced by recreational use of N2O. However, the number of patients admitted to hospital likely represents the \u2018tip of the iceberg\u2019, with many less severe presentations remaining undetected. After raising awareness, attention should focus on measuring the extent of the problem, the groups affected, and devising ways to prevent potentially long-term neurological damage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hydroxocobalamin", "Myelopathy", "Subacute degeneration of the spinal cord", "Vitamin B12"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Ataxia", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Nitrous Oxide", "Retrospective Studies", "Spinal Cord", "Spinal Cord Diseases", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Vitamin B 12", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045070549", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57201481051": {"Name": "Keddie S.", "AuthorID": "57201481051", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and Department of Molecular Neuroscience, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55569225400": {"Name": "Adams A.", "AuthorID": "55569225400", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Emergency Care and Acute Medicine Clinical Academic Group, Neuroscience, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "26661478600": {"Name": "Kelso A.R.C.", "AuthorID": "26661478600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7401858560": {"Name": "Turner B.", "AuthorID": "7401858560", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Emergency Care and Acute Medicine Clinical Academic Group, Neuroscience, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "8711451500": {"Name": "Schmierer K.", "AuthorID": "8711451500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7801629497": {"Name": "Gnanapavan S.", "AuthorID": "7801629497", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003290890": {"Name": "Malaspina A.", "AuthorID": "7003290890", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "34770127900": {"Name": "Giovannoni G.", "AuthorID": "34770127900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine, Neuroscience and Trauma, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57208954110": {"Name": "Basnett I.", "AuthorID": "57208954110", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "The Royal London Hospital, Emergency Care and Acute Medicine Clinical Academic Group, Neuroscience, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "24438206900": {"Name": "Noyce A.J.", "AuthorID": "24438206900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and The London School of Medicine, Preventive Neurology Unit, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
