A natural answer is that we can, since it is a platitude that rational belief does not require truth; it is possible for a belief to be rational and mistaken, and this holds for any subject matter at all. However, the platitude causes trouble when applied to rationality itself. The possibility of rational mistakes about what rationality requires generates a puzzle. When combined with two further plausible claims - the enkratic principle, and the claim that rational requirements apply universally - we get the result that rationality generates inconsistent requirements. One popular and attractive solution to the puzzle denies that it is possible to make rational mistakes about what rationality requires. I show why (contra Titelbaum (2015b), and Littlejohn (2015)) this solution is doomed to fail.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065126952", "SubjectAreas": [["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"57208213749": {"Name": "Field C.", "AuthorID": "57208213749", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "Arche Philosophical Research Centre for Logic, Language, Metaphysics, and Epistemology, University of St. Andrews"}}}
