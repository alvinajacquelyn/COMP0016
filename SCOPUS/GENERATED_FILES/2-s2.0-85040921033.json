However, little research provides a model to help understand the perceptual qualities of smellscapes. This paper, taking pleasantness as a perceptual quality dimension, aimed to explore indicators influencing people's pleasantness of smellscapes in a selected case. People's natural speaking language was used as resources to understand their perceptions. Grounded Theory was used as a methodological approach in this study in a selected case. Nineteen participants were recruited for smell walking with semi-structured interviews. Overall, nine indicators emerged from participants\u2019 descriptions which contribute to their smellscape pleasantness: cleanliness, preference, appropriateness, naturalness, freshness, familiarity, calmness, intensity and purity. Meanwhile, four types of pleasantness were found according to dominant indicators: preference dominated, healthiness dominated, memories and habituation dominated and context dominated. A perceptual model has been developed based on the indicators which can be used to classify smellscapes through their dominant perceptual features and evaluate smellscape qualities based on pleasantness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Grounded Theory", "indicators", "perceptions", "pleasantness", "urban"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040921033", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"57199893077": {"Name": "Xiao J.", "AuthorID": "57199893077", "AffiliationID": "60100434", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture and Design, Birmingham City University"}, "7004547108": {"Name": "Tait M.", "AuthorID": "7004547108", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban Planning and Studies, University of Sheffield"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, The University of Sheffield"}}}
