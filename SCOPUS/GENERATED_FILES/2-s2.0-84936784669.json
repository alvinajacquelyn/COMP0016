Nivsarkar et al.Following fetal or neonatal gene transfer in mice and other species immune tolerance of the transgenic protein is frequently observed; however the underlying mechanisms remain largely undefined. In this study fetal and neonatal BALB/c mice received adenovirus vector to deliver human factor IX (hFIX) cDNA. The long-term tolerance of hFIX was robust in the face of immune challenge with hFIX protein and adjuvant but was eliminated by simultaneous administration of anti-CD25+ antibody. Naive irradiated BALB/c mice which had received lymphocytes from donors immunised with hFIX developed anti-hFIX antibodies upon immune challenge. Cotransplantation with CD4+CD25+ cells isolated from neonatally tolerized donors decreased the antibody response. In contrast, cotransplantation with CD4+CD25-cells isolated from the same donors increased the antibody response. These data provide evidence that immune tolerance following perinatal gene transfer is maintained by a CD4+CD25+ regulatory population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenoviridae", "Adoptive Transfer", "Animals", "Antibodies", "Antigens, CD4", "Factor IX", "Gene Expression", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit", "Lymphocyte Depletion", "Mice", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Tissue Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936784669", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7004143571": {"Name": "Nivsarkar M.S.", "AuthorID": "7004143571", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, University College London"}, "7101614142": {"Name": "Buckley S.M.K.", "AuthorID": "7101614142", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, University College London"}, "56724044900": {"Name": "Perocheau D.", "AuthorID": "56724044900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gene Transfer Technology Group, University College London"}, "7003698645": {"Name": "Waddington S.N.", "AuthorID": "7003698645", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Antiviral Gene Therapy Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "35243435800": {"Name": "Parker A.L.", "AuthorID": "35243435800", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "7005835387": {"Name": "McKay T.R.", "AuthorID": "7005835387", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Group, Cardiovascular and Cell Sciences Research Institute, St. George's University of London"}, "14045774100": {"Name": "Rahim A.A.", "AuthorID": "14045774100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7007163773": {"Name": "Howe S.J.", "AuthorID": "7007163773", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
