The plate is discretised using a continuous/discontinuous finite element method based on standard continuous piecewise polynomial finite element spaces. The beams are discretised by the CutFEM technique of letting the basis functions of the plate represent also the beams which are allowed to pass through the plate elements. This allows for a fast and easy way of assessing where the plate should be supported, for instance, in an optimization loop.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cut finite element method", "Discontinuous Galerkin", "Euler\u2013Bernoulli beam", "Kirchhoff\u2013Love plate", "Reinforced plate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bernoulli", "Discontinuous galerkin", "Finite element simulations", "Finite element space", "Kirchhoff", "Optimization loop", "Piecewise polynomials", "Reinforced plate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041447903", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "Burman E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7004355911": {"Name": "Hansbo P.", "AuthorID": "7004355911", "AffiliationID": "60016471", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping University"}, "7203022296": {"Name": "Larson M.", "AuthorID": "7203022296", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
