These interactions lead to diverse processes such as generation of protein coronas, nano\u2013bio interfaces, particle wrapping, and biocatalytic processes that could determine the ultimate fate of graphene nanocomposites in biologic systems. However, such interactions and their effects on the bioavailability of graphene have not yet been widely appreciated, despite the fact that this is the primary surface in contact with cells. Methods: This paper reports on the integrative physiochemical interaction between trypsin and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) to determine their potential biologic identity in enzyme engineering. This interaction was measured by a wide range of analytical methods. Results: Definitive binding and modulation of trypsin\u2013GQDs was demonstrated for the first time by use of vibrational spectroscopy and wetting transparency, which revealed that trypsin was absorbed on GQDs\u2019 surface through its cationic and hydrophilic residues. Our findings suggested that trypsin\u2019s active sites were stabilized and protected by the GQDs, which were likely to be responsible for the high bioavailability of GQDs in enzymes. Conclusion: Our work demonstrates the efficacy of GQDs as an enzyme modulator with high specificity, and their great application potential in enzyme engineering as well as enzyme-based therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioavailability", "Enzyme", "Graphene", "Luminescence", "Surface energy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalytic Domain", "Graphite", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Luminescence", "Nanocomposites", "Quantum Dots", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman", "Trypsin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044273240", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55484476700": {"Name": "Tabish T.", "AuthorID": "55484476700", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "57201317950": {"Name": "Karadag I.", "AuthorID": "57201317950", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "8658461500": {"Name": "Horsell D.", "AuthorID": "8658461500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "55308934100": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "55308934100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "56495569700": {"Name": "Pranjol M.", "AuthorID": "56495569700", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "6602306036": {"Name": "Whatmore J.", "AuthorID": "6602306036", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School"}}}
