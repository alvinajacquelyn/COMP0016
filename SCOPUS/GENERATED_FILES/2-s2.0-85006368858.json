Most studies on the transcriptomic response to sexual selection treat sexual selection as a single force, but postmating sexual selection in particular is expected to specifically target gonadal tissue. The three male morphs of the ocellated wrasse (Symphodus ocellatus) make it possible to test the role of postmating sexual selection in shaping the gonadal transcriptome. Nesting males hold territories and have the highest reproductive success, yet we detected feminization of their gonadal gene expression compared to satellite males. Satellite males are less brightly coloured and experience more intense sperm competition than nesting males. In line with postmating sexual selection affecting gonadal gene expression, we detected a more masculinized expression profile in satellites. Sneakers are the lowest quality males and showed both de-masculinization and de-feminization of gene expression. We also detected higher rates of gene sequence evolution of male-biased genes compared to unbiased genes, which could at least in part be explained by positive selection. Together, these results reveal the potential for postmating sexual selection to drive higher rates of gene sequence evolution and shape the gonadal transcriptome profile.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alternative reproductive tactics", "expression variance", "masculinization", "morphs", "positive selection", "sex-biased genes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Evolution, Molecular", "Female", "Male", "Perciformes", "Phenotype", "Reproduction", "Sexual Behavior, Animal", "Spermatozoa", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006368858", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"16240675400": {"Name": "Dean R.", "AuthorID": "16240675400", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Monash University"}, "54883184700": {"Name": "Wright A.", "AuthorID": "54883184700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6603493469": {"Name": "Mank J.", "AuthorID": "6603493469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "33068122400": {"Name": "Marsh-Rollo S.", "AuthorID": "33068122400", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour, McMaster University"}, "6603823213": {"Name": "Alonzo S.", "AuthorID": "6603823213", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Yale University"}, "25636143600": {"Name": "Nugent B.", "AuthorID": "25636143600", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Pennsylvania"}}}
