Published by BMJ.Objective Previous studies have reported inverse associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and lung function, but less is known about whether pulmonary function is affected by SES changes. We aimed to describe the relationship of changes of SES between childhood and adulthood with pulmonary function. Design Cross-sectional study. Participants The study sample included 4104 men and women, aged 45-69 years, residents of Krakow, participating in the Polish part of the Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial Factors in Eastern Europe Project. Main outcome Forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were assessed by the standardised spirometry procedure. Participants were classified into three categories of SES (low, moderate or high) based on information on parent's education, housing standard during childhood, own education, employment status, household amenities and financial status. Results The adjusted difference in mean FVC between persons with low and high adulthood SES was 100 mL (p=0.005) in men and 100 mL (p<0.001) in women; the differences in mean FEV 1 were 103 mL (p<0.001) and 80 mL (p<0.001), respectively. Upward social mobility and moderate or high SES at both childhood and adulthood were related to significantly higher FEV 1 and FVC compared with low SES at both childhood and adulthood or downward social mobility. Conclusions Low SES over a life course was associated with the lowest lung function. Downward social mobility was associated with a poorer pulmonary function, while upward mobility or life course and moderate or high SES were associated with a better pulmonary function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["lung function", "ses", "social mobility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Poland", "Risk Factors", "Social Mobility", "Spirometry", "Urban Population", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059877624", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56781025700": {"Name": "Polak M.", "AuthorID": "56781025700", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "57210300468": {"Name": "Szafraniec K.", "AuthorID": "57210300468", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "37019847800": {"Name": "Kozela M.", "AuthorID": "37019847800", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "37008062900": {"Name": "Wolfshaut-Wolak R.", "AuthorID": "37008062900", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "7004784461": {"Name": "Pajak A.", "AuthorID": "7004784461", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
