All rights reserved.The emerging complexity of the transcriptional landscape poses great challenges to our conventional preconceptions of how the genome regulates brain function and dysfunction. Non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) confer a high level of intricate and dynamic regulation of various molecular processes in the CNS and they have been implicated in neurodevelopment and brain ageing, as well as in synapse function and cognitive performance, in both health and disease. ncRNA-mediated processes may be involved in various aspects of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding these events may help to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Here, we provide an overview of the complex mechanisms that are affected by the diverse ncRNA classes that have been implicated in neurodegeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Models, Genetic", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "RNA, Untranslated"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030621540", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"34877713200": {"Name": "Salta E.", "AuthorID": "34877713200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven, Department of Neurosciences, Leuven Institute for Neuroscience and Disease, (LIND)"}, "7006241978": {"Name": "De Strooper B.", "AuthorID": "7006241978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}}}
