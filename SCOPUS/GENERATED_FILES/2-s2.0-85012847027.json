Two experienced therapists selected 14 sessions that represented their work during the first year of treatment. Sessions were transcribed and segmented to identify interactional units for coding. QDA Miner software was used to facilitate data analysis. A systematic qualitative, inductive/deductive approach was followed starting from categories identified in the literature, but also including newly emerging categories and interventions. Seven sessions were double coded to stabilize the coding tree and a \"member check\" was completed where therapists rated their own transcripts. A total of 24 mentalization-based techniques were identified, including 17 additional techniques. A conceptual framework organizing all observed mentalization-based interventions is proposed. The findings of this study provide a framework for studying techniques that may enhance the capacity to mentalize, and that could be features of therapeutic practice across a range of modalities of psychotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Psychotherapy, Psychodynamic", "Theory of Mind"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012847027", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57201898670": {"Name": "Specht P.M.", "AuthorID": "57201898670", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Laval, \u00c9cole de psychologie"}, "14830901900": {"Name": "Ensink K.", "AuthorID": "14830901900", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Laval, \u00c9cole de psychologie"}, "6701813984": {"Name": "Normandin L.", "AuthorID": "6701813984", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Laval, \u00c9cole de psychologie"}, "57216973595": {"Name": "Midgley N.", "AuthorID": "57216973595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
