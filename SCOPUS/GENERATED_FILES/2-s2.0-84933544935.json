The method is consistent and unconditionally stable on rather general unstructured meshes and time-partitions. Error bounds for both rough and regular solutions in terms of temporal regularity show that the method is arbitrarily high-order with optimal convergence rates with respect to the mesh size, time-interval length and temporal polynomial degree, and possibly suboptimal by an order and a half in the spatial polynomial degree. Numerical experiments on problems with strongly anisotropic diffusion coefficients and early-time singularities demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the method, with exponential convergence rates achieved under combined hp- and (Formula presented.) -refinement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["35D35", "35K10", "35K55", "65N12", "65N15", "65N30"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933544935", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55650420000": {"Name": "Smears I.", "AuthorID": "55650420000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "7003869539": {"Name": "S\u00fcli E.", "AuthorID": "7003869539", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}}}
