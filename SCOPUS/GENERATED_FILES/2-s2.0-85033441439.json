Adult neurogenesis is impaired in several neurodegenerative mouse models including \u03b1-synuclein (a-syn) transgenic mice. Among different a-syn species, a-syn oligomers were reported to be the most toxic species for neurons. Here, we studied the impact of wild-type vs. oligomer-prone a-syn on neurogenesis. We compared the wild-type a-syn transgenic mouse model (Thy1-WTS) to its equivalent transgenic for oligomer-prone E57K-mutant a-syn (Thy1-E57K). Transgenic a-syn was highly expressed within the hippocampus of both models, but was not present within adult neural stem cells and neuroblasts. Proliferation and survival of newly generated neurons were unchanged in both transgenic models. Thy1-WTS showed a minor integration deficit regarding mushroom spine density of newborn neurons, whereas Thy1-E57K exhibited a severe reduction of all spines. We conclude that cell-extrinsic a-syn impairs mushroom spine formation of adult newborn neurons and that oligomer-prone a-syn exacerbates this integration deficit. Moreover, our data suggest that a-syn reduces the survival of newborn neurons by a cell-intrinsic mechanism during the early neuroblast development. The finding of increased spine pathology in Thy1-E57K is a new pathogenic function of oligomeric a-syn and precedes overt neurodegeneration. Thus, it may constitute a readout for therapeutic approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult neurogenesis", "Alpha-synuclein", "Hippocampus", "Oligomers"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Synuclein", "Animals", "Bromodeoxyuridine", "Caspase 3", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glutamic Acid", "Hippocampus", "Lysine", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Mutation", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons", "Neuropeptides", "Phosphopyruvate Hydratase", "SOXB1 Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033441439", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"36051905400": {"Name": "Regensburger M.", "AuthorID": "36051905400", "AffiliationID": "107108996", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, FAU"}, "57217685212": {"Name": "Stoll S.", "AuthorID": "57217685212", "AffiliationID": "107108996", "AffiliationName": "IZKF Junior Research Group III, and BMBF Research Group Neuroscience, FAU"}, "56690631100": {"Name": "Loskarn S.", "AuthorID": "56690631100", "AffiliationID": "107108996", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, FAU"}, "6603255079": {"Name": "Winner B.", "AuthorID": "6603255079", "AffiliationID": "107108996", "AffiliationName": "IZKF Junior Research Group III, and BMBF Research Group Neuroscience, FAU"}, "53867273100": {"Name": "Schreglmann S.R.", "AuthorID": "53867273100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "6603727752": {"Name": "Rockenstein E.", "AuthorID": "6603727752", "AffiliationID": "60121548, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego"}, "35377063800": {"Name": "Masliah E.", "AuthorID": "35377063800", "AffiliationID": "60121548, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego"}, "7102629470": {"Name": "Xiang W.", "AuthorID": "7102629470", "AffiliationID": "107108996", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, FAU"}}}
