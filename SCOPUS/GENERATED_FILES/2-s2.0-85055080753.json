This strain was previously demonstrated to possess some specific plant growth promoting traits but its endophytic attitude and its role in biocontrol was only partially explored. In this study, the potential biocontrol action of the strain was investigated in vitro and in vivo and, by genome sequence analyses, putative functions involved in biocontrol and plant-bacteria interaction were assessed. Results: Firstly, to confirm the endophytic behavior of the strain, its ability to colonize grapevine tissues was demonstrated and its biocontrol properties were analyzed. Antagonism test results showed that the strain could reduce and inhibit the mycelium growth of diverse plant pathogens in vitro and in vivo. The strain was demonstrated to produce different molecules of the lipopeptide class; moreover, its genome was sequenced, and analysis of the sequences revealed the presence of many protein-coding genes involved in the biocontrol process, such as transporters, plant-cell lytic enzymes, siderophores and other secondary metabolites. Conclusions: This step-by-step analysis shows that Bacillus licheniformis GL174 may be a good biocontrol agent candidate, and describes some distinguished traits and possible key elements involved in this process. The use of this strain could potentially help grapevine plants to cope with pathogen attacks and reduce the amount of chemicals used in the vineyard.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacillus licheniformis", "Bacterial genome sequencing", "Biocontrol bacteria", "Endophytes", "Grapevine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacillus licheniformis", "Biodiversity", "Biological Control Agents", "Endophytes", "Genome, Bacterial", "Phylogeny", "Plant Diseases", "Plant Leaves", "Plant Roots", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Vitis", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055080753", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"56166639400": {"Name": "Nigris S.", "AuthorID": "56166639400", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Botanical Garden and Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "6701348269": {"Name": "Baldan B.", "AuthorID": "6701348269", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Botanical Garden and Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "16027864100": {"Name": "Baldan E.", "AuthorID": "16027864100", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "23487257300": {"Name": "Tondello A.", "AuthorID": "23487257300", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "55209986200": {"Name": "Zanella F.", "AuthorID": "55209986200", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "57204267419": {"Name": "Guidolin V.", "AuthorID": "57204267419", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "57204275068": {"Name": "Bordin N.", "AuthorID": "57204275068", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "6507601495": {"Name": "Barizza E.", "AuthorID": "6507601495", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "6506363288": {"Name": "Marcato S.", "AuthorID": "6506363288", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "6602479060": {"Name": "Zottini M.", "AuthorID": "6602479060", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "7102644197": {"Name": "Valle G.", "AuthorID": "7102644197", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Padova"}, "8682745200": {"Name": "Vitulo N.", "AuthorID": "8682745200", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnology, University of Verona"}, "7004145833": {"Name": "Favaro G.", "AuthorID": "7004145833", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Padova"}, "55432930000": {"Name": "Telatin A.", "AuthorID": "55432930000", "AffiliationID": "119526703", "AffiliationName": "CRIBI Biotechnology Center"}, "6603849082": {"Name": "Squartini A.", "AuthorID": "6603849082", "AffiliationID": "113416770", "AffiliationName": "DAFNAE Department of Agronomy Food Natural Resources Animals and Environment"}}}
