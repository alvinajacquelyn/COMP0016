The study draws on 33 in-depth interviews from TMOs in the UK construction, engineering, and infrastructure industries. Interviews were further triangulated with data from a series of industry events and workshops. The investigation explores key characteristics of learning in TMOs and their impact on performance. The research demonstrates the shift towards informal ways of learning and importance of narratives about the purpose of TMOs. Boundary spanners actively engage in sharing learning through stories about lessons learned from past experiences in managing TMOs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary spanners", "Identity", "Learning organization", "Narratives", "Stories", "Temporary multi-organizations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047732829", "SubjectAreas": [["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"55218042800": {"Name": "Sergeeva N.", "AuthorID": "55218042800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "23502497800": {"Name": "Roehrich J.K.", "AuthorID": "23502497800", "AffiliationID": "60116562", "AffiliationName": "HPC Supply Chain Innovation Lab, Information, Decisions and Operations Division, School of Management, University of Bath"}}}
