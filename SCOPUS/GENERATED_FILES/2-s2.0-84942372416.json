Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey including 8,821 adults (51.4 % female) was conducted in Krakow, Poland. Coffee and tea consumption was evaluated using food frequency questionnaires. MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation definition. Linear and logistic regression models were performed to estimate odds ratios and confidence intervals. Results: Among high coffee and tea consumers (3 or more cups/day), high prevalence of female gender, young age, medium\u2013high educational and occupational level, high total energy intake, and smoking habit were found. High coffee drinkers had lower BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and higher HDL cholesterol than those drinking less than 1 cup/day. In contrast, high tea consumers had lower BMI, waist circumference, but not diastolic blood pressure, which was higher than low drinkers. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, both higher coffee and tea consumption were negatively associated with MetS (OR 0.75, 95 % CI 0.66, 0.86 and OR 0.79, 95 % CI 0.67, 0.92, respectively). Among specific components of MetS, high coffee consumption was negatively associated with waist circumference, hypertension, and triglycerides, whereas tea consumption with central obesity and fasting plasma glucose in women, but not in men. Conclusions: Coffee and tea consumption was negatively associated with MetS and some of its components.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood pressure", "Coffee", "Dyslipidemia", "Hyperglycemia", "Metabolic syndrome", "Tea", "Waist circumference"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Glucose", "Blood Pressure", "Body Mass Index", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Coffee", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Energy Intake", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Life Style", "Linear Models", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Metabolic Syndrome X", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Nutrition Assessment", "Poland", "Prevalence", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tea", "Triglycerides", "Waist Circumference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942372416", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"35299157700": {"Name": "Grosso G.", "AuthorID": "35299157700", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "25629876800": {"Name": "Stepaniak U.", "AuthorID": "25629876800", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "36242169600": {"Name": "Micek A.", "AuthorID": "36242169600", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "57211182892": {"Name": "Topor-M\u0105dry R.", "AuthorID": "57211182892", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "57210300468": {"Name": "Szafraniec K.", "AuthorID": "57210300468", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "7004784461": {"Name": "Paj\u0105k A.", "AuthorID": "7004784461", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
