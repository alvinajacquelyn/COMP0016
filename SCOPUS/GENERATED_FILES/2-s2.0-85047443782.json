While much of the efforts have traditionally been directed at geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets, recent studies reveal that systems featuring competing antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interactions are also promising candidate materials. We find that this competition leads to the notion of special temperatures, analogous to those of gases, at which the competing interactions balance, and the system is quasi-ideal. Although induced by weak perturbing interactions, these special temperatures are surprisingly high and constitute an accessible experimental diagnostic of eventual order or spin-liquid properties. The well characterised Hamiltonian and extended low-temperature susceptibility measurement of the canonical frustrated ferromagnet Dy2Ti2O7 enables us to formulate both a phenomenological and microscopic theory of special temperatures for magnets. Other members of this class of magnets include kapellasite Cu3Zn(OH)6Cl2 and the spinel GeCo2O4.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047443782", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"32667481600": {"Name": "Bovo L.", "AuthorID": "32667481600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Innovation and Enterprise, University College London"}, "7006543434": {"Name": "Bramwell S.T.", "AuthorID": "7006543434", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57202194317": {"Name": "Twengstr\u00f6m M.", "AuthorID": "57202194317", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Royal Institute of Technology"}, "6507947027": {"Name": "Henelius P.", "AuthorID": "6507947027", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Royal Institute of Technology"}, "7006410897": {"Name": "Petrenko O.A.", "AuthorID": "7006410897", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "57211613143": {"Name": "Fennell T.", "AuthorID": "57211613143", "AffiliationID": "60020195, 60012894", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Neutron Scattering and Imaging, Paul Scherrer Institut"}, "7006933020": {"Name": "Gingras M.J.P.", "AuthorID": "7006933020", "AffiliationID": "60031486", "AffiliationName": "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics"}}}
