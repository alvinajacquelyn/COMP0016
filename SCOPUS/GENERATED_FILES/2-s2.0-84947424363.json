Obstructions, such as furniture and household items, may block the existing windows, and therefore affect interior daylight conditions. A facade design approach is needed that simultaneously takes into account daylighting and the volume of usable space for obstructions in the perimeter zone of such rooms. This study simulates daylight distributions in a typical small residential room with obstructions in front of windows. The simulation consists of two parts. First, the effects on horizontal illuminances caused by different positions and shapes of obstructions are examined under an overcast sky. Second, the maximum usable space volumes for obstructions of 51 optimized facade configurations are calculated in terms of four window-to-wall ratios (WWRs). The results of this study show that optimizing the forms of facade design can increase the usable interior space volume and meet the daylighting requirements of Chinese standards for small residential rooms. Additionally, by using the optimized facade forms, a facade with a WWR value of 50% provides the maximum usable space for obstructions. Based on the above results, this paper presents two matrices that can help architects in selecting the appropriate fenestration methods and confirming the size of usable space and allocation for residents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["daylight simulation", "daylighting performance", "facade design", "perimeter zone", "small residential room", "usable space"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chinese Standard", "Facade design", "Interior space", "Limited space", "Overcast skies", "small residential room", "usable space", "Window-to-wall ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947424363", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"]], "AuthorData": {"56965804900": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "56965804900", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Technology and Design of Building Envelopes, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "56966195000": {"Name": "Wolf T.", "AuthorID": "56966195000", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Technology and Design of Building Envelopes, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, The University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}}}
