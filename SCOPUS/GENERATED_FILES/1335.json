We explored the impact of pre-treatment susceptibility on the outcome of lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy. Methods: Treatment-naive individuals who experienced lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy failure from the MONARK study were matched (by subtype, viral load and baseline CD4 count) with those who achieved virological response ('successes'). Successes were defined by viral load <400 copies/mL after week 24 and <50 copies/mL from week 48 to week 96. Full-length Gag-protease was amplified from patient samples for in vitro phenotypic susceptibility testing, with susceptibility expressed as fold change (FC) relative to a subtype B reference strain. Results: Baseline lopinavir susceptibility was lower in viral failures compared with viral successes, but the differences were not statistically significant (median lopinavir susceptibility: 4.4 versus 8.5, respectively, P=0.17). Among CRF02_AG/G patients, there was a significant difference in lopinavir susceptibility between the two groups (7.1 versus 10.4, P=0.047), while in subtype B the difference was not significant (2.7 versus 3.4, P=0.13). Subtype CRF02_AG/G viruses had a median lopinavir FC of 8.7 compared with 3.1 for subtype B (P=0.001). Conclusions: We report an association between reduced PI susceptibility (using full-length Gag-protease sequences) at baseline and subsequent virological failure on lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy in antiretroviral-naive patients harbouring subtype CRF02_AG/G viruses. We speculate that this may be important in the context of suboptimal adherence in determining viral failure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "Gag", "Protease inhibitor", "Resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Genotype", "HIV Infections", "HIV Protease", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Lopinavir", "Male", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Ritonavir", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Treatment Failure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928337603", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55944950000": {"Name": "Sutherland K.A.", "AuthorID": "55944950000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, University College London"}, "6506370126": {"Name": "Mbisa J.L.", "AuthorID": "6506370126", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Virus Reference Department, Public Health England"}, "56848412000": {"Name": "Gupta R.K.", "AuthorID": "56848412000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, University College London"}, "57197587205": {"Name": "Ghosn J.", "AuthorID": "57197587205", "AffiliationID": "60018822, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "APHP, UF de th\u00e9rapeutique en Immuno Infectiologie, CHU Hotel Dieu"}, "7003547342": {"Name": "Chaix M.L.", "AuthorID": "7003547342", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes, EA 7327, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine site Necker"}, "16238705700": {"Name": "Gregson J.", "AuthorID": "16238705700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "8584989800": {"Name": "Cohen codar I.", "AuthorID": "8584989800", "AffiliationID": "60105169", "AffiliationName": "AbbVie Laboratory"}, "35274714800": {"Name": "Delfraissy J.F.", "AuthorID": "35274714800", "AffiliationID": "60013430, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "AP-HP, Department of Internal Medicine, Bicetre University Hospital"}, "35261841200": {"Name": "Delaugerre C.", "AuthorID": "35261841200", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60002900, 60000905, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Virology, U941 INSERM Paris Diderot University, St Louis Hospital-APHP"}}}
