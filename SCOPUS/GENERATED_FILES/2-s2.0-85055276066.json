In this paper, we explore how PrEP use impacted existing sexual risk behaviours and risk reduction strategies using qualitative data from the PROUD study. From February 2014 to January 2016, we conducted 41 in-depth interviews with gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) enrolled in the PROUD PrEP study at sexual health clinics in England. The interviews were conducted in English and were audio-recorded. The recordings were transcribed, coded and analysed using framework analysis. In the interviews, we explored participants\u2019 sexual behaviour before joining the study and among those using or who had used PrEP, changes to sexual behaviour after starting PrEP. Participants described the risk behaviour and management strategies before using PrEP, which included irregular condom use, sero-sorting, and strategic positioning. Participants described their sexual risk taking before initiating PrEP in the context of the sexualised use of drugs, geographical spaces linked with higher risk sexual norms, and digitised sexual networking, as well as problematic psychological factors that exacerbated risk taking. The findings highlight that in the main, individuals who were already having frequent condomless sex, added PrEP to the existing range of risk management strategies, influencing the boundaries of the \u2018rules\u2019 for some but not all. While approximately half the participants reduced other risk reduction strategies after starting PrEP, the other half did not alter their behaviours. PrEP provided an additional HIV prevention option to a cohort of GBMSM at high risk of HIV due to inconsistent use of other prevention options. In summary, PrEP provides a critical and necessary additional HIV prevention option that individuals can add to existing strategies in order to enhance protection, at least from HIV. As a daily pill, PrEP offers protection in the context of the sex cultures associated with sexualised drug use, digitised sexual applications and shifting social norms around sexual fulfilment and risk taking. PrEP can offer short or longer-term options for individuals as their sexual desires change over their life course offering protection from HIV during periods of heightened risk. PrEP should not be perceived or positioned in opposition to the existing HIV prevention toolkit, but rather as additive and as a tool that can and is having a substantial impact on HIV.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gay and other MSM", "HIV prevention", "Pre-exposure prophylaxis", "PrEP", "Risk compensation", "Sexual risk behaviour", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "England", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "HIV Infections", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Male", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Unsafe Sex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055276066", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6506928000": {"Name": "Gafos M.", "AuthorID": "6506928000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "54584975700": {"Name": "Dolling D.", "AuthorID": "54584975700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "57188638710": {"Name": "White E.", "AuthorID": "57188638710", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "24281188200": {"Name": "Brodnicki E.", "AuthorID": "24281188200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "57188643631": {"Name": "Wood G.", "AuthorID": "57188643631", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "56595739700": {"Name": "Dunn D.", "AuthorID": "56595739700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "23482010600": {"Name": "McCormack S.", "AuthorID": "23482010600", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "53865456400": {"Name": "Nutland W.", "AuthorID": "53865456400", "AffiliationID": "121490173", "AffiliationName": "Prepster"}, "36096547200": {"Name": "Bell G.", "AuthorID": "36096547200", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Health, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6504682167": {"Name": "Dewsnap C.", "AuthorID": "6504682167", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Health, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "48061327000": {"Name": "Rae C.", "AuthorID": "48061327000", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "41862290500": {"Name": "Rayment M.", "AuthorID": "41862290500", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603375965": {"Name": "McOwan A.", "AuthorID": "6603375965", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202865115": {"Name": "Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "7202865115", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25724754300": {"Name": "Wayal S.", "AuthorID": "25724754300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Research in Sexual Health and HIV, Mortimer Market Centre, Institute for Global Health, UCL"}, "57207820760": {"Name": "Clarke A.", "AuthorID": "57207820760", "AffiliationID": "60012806", "AffiliationName": "Claude Nicol Centre, Royal Sussex County Hospital"}, "22951973800": {"Name": "Schembri G.", "AuthorID": "22951973800", "AffiliationID": "60120605", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Centre for Sexual Health, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209757944": {"Name": "Gilson R.", "AuthorID": "57209757944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Mortimer Market Centre, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "35581226900": {"Name": "Fox J.", "AuthorID": "35581226900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35309426800": {"Name": "Apea V.", "AuthorID": "35309426800", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Ambrose King Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
