Methods: A quantitative, questionnaire-based international survey was conducted. Results: Weak-opioid users appeared as bothered by constipation as strong-opioid users (38% vs 40%, respectively; p = 0.40), despite it causing less-severe physical symptoms and impact on QoL. Strong-opioid users meeting Rome IV OIC criteria appeared to experience greater symptomatic and biopsychosocial burden from constipation than those not satisfying these criteria. Almost one-fifth of respondents were dissatisfied with their current constipation treatment and around one-third found balancing the need for adequate pain relief with constipation side effects challenging. Consequently, more than half failed to adhere to their prescribed treatment regimens, or resorted to suboptimal strategies, e.g. 40% reduced their opioid intake, to relieve constipation. Almost 60% of healthcare professionals did not adequately counsel patients about constipation as a common side effect of opioid use. Conclusions: Findings suggest that both weak- and strong-opioid users suffer comparable bother and decreased QoL, Rome IV criteria can identify patients with more-severe OIC, but may underdiagnose patients showing fewer symptoms, and increased education is needed to manage patients\u2019 expectations and enable improved OIC self-management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "biopsychosocial burden", "management and counselling", "Opioid-induced constipation", "patient survey", "Rome IV criteria"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049855537", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"13805283000": {"Name": "Andresen V.", "AuthorID": "13805283000", "AffiliationID": "60013352", "AffiliationName": "Israelitic Hospital Hamburg"}, "57202920682": {"Name": "Banerji V.", "AuthorID": "57202920682", "AffiliationID": "120964199", "AffiliationName": "Insight Dojo"}, "57202921150": {"Name": "Hall G.", "AuthorID": "57202921150", "AffiliationID": "120964199", "AffiliationName": "Insight Dojo"}, "56233647700": {"Name": "Lass A.", "AuthorID": "56233647700", "AffiliationID": "60007952", "AffiliationName": "Shionogi"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.V.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}}}
