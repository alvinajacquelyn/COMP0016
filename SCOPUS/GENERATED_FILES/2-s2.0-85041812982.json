As the pressure increases, most gases depart from this ideal behavior in a sublinear fashion, leveling off at pressures in the 1- to 5-kbar (0.1 to 0.5 GPa) range with solubilities of less than 1 mole percent (mol %). This contrasts strikingly with the well-known marked increase in solubility of simple gases inwater at high temperature associated with the critical point (647 K and 212 bar). The solubility of the smallest hydrocarbon, the simple gas methane, in water under a range of pressure and temperature is of widespread importance, because it is a paradigmatic hydrophobe and occurs widely in terrestrial and extraterrestrial geology. We report measurements up to 3.5 GPa of the pressure dependence of the solubility of methane in water at 100\u00b0C-well below the latter's critical temperature. Our results reveal a marked increase in solubility between 1 and 2 GPa, leading to a state above 2 GPa where the maximum solubility of methane in water exceeds 35 mol %.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Critical temperatures", "High pressure", "High temperature", "Ideal behavior", "Pressure and temperature", "Pressure dependence", "Pressure increase", "Saturated solubility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041812982", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193205994": {"Name": "Pruteanu C.G.", "AuthorID": "57193205994", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, School of Physics Astronomy, Centre for Science at Extreme Conditions, University of Edinburgh"}, "7005798463": {"Name": "Ackland G.J.", "AuthorID": "7005798463", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, School of Physics Astronomy, Centre for Science at Extreme Conditions, University of Edinburgh"}, "7103025520": {"Name": "Poon W.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7103025520", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, School of Physics Astronomy, Centre for Science at Extreme Conditions, University of Edinburgh"}, "7005956581": {"Name": "Loveday J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005956581", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, School of Physics Astronomy, Centre for Science at Extreme Conditions, University of Edinburgh"}}}
