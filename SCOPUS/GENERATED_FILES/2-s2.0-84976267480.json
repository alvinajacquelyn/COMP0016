In particular, 5-HT4receptors are known to mediate intestinal peristalsis and recent data in experimental animals have shown their role in neuronal maintenance and neurogenesis. This study has been designed to test whether prucalopride, a well-known full 5-HT4agonist, exerts protective effects on neurons, including enteric neurons, exposed to oxidative stress challenge. Sulforhodamine B assay was used to determine the survival of SH-SY5Y cells, human enteric neurospheres, and ex vivo submucosal neurons following H2O2exposure in the presence or absence of prucalopride (1 nM). Specificity of 5-HT4- mediated neuroprotection was established by experiments performed in the presence of GR113808, a 5-HT4antagonist. Prucalopride exhibited a significant neuroprotective effect. SH-SY5Y cells pretreated with prucalopride were protected from the injury elicited by H2O2as shown by increased survival (73.5 \u00b1 0.1% of neuronal survival vs. 33.3 \u00b1 0.1%, respectively; P < 0.0001) and a significant reduction of proapoptotic caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation in all neurons tested. The protective effect of prucalopride was reversed by the specific 5-HT4antagonist GR113808. Prucalopride promotes a significant neuroprotection against oxidative-mediated proapoptotic mechanisms. Our data pave the way for novel therapeutic implications of full 5-HT4agonists in gut dysmotility characterized by neuronal degeneration, which go beyond the well-known enterokinetic effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5-HT4full agonist", "Enterokinetic drug", "Prucalopride", "Serotonin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Apoptosis", "Benzofurans", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Intestines", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Neurons", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Oxidative Stress", "Serotonin 5-HT4 Receptor Agonists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976267480", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56367478800": {"Name": "Bianco F.", "AuthorID": "56367478800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "36514558000": {"Name": "Giancola F.", "AuthorID": "36514558000", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "12806758500": {"Name": "Mazzoni M.", "AuthorID": "12806758500", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "6602984512": {"Name": "Clavenzani P.", "AuthorID": "6602984512", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "8581436000": {"Name": "Bonora E.", "AuthorID": "8581436000", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "34771192700": {"Name": "Boschetti E.", "AuthorID": "34771192700", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "7005929348": {"Name": "Volta U.", "AuthorID": "7005929348", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "55266140800": {"Name": "Bazzoli F.", "AuthorID": "55266140800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "7005984572": {"Name": "Seri M.", "AuthorID": "7005984572", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "7006377452": {"Name": "Stanghellini V.", "AuthorID": "7006377452", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "7005471207": {"Name": "de Giorgio R.", "AuthorID": "7005471207", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "7003295303": {"Name": "Natarajan D.", "AuthorID": "7003295303", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Gastroenterology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "14826073500": {"Name": "Vargiolu M.", "AuthorID": "14826073500", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "BioNanoGenLab Health Sciences and Technologies-Interdepartmental Center for Industrial Research, University of Bologna"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "BioNanoGenLab Health Sciences and Technologies-Interdepartmental Center for Industrial Research, University of Bologna"}, "6602212341": {"Name": "Torresan F.", "AuthorID": "6602212341", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Digestive System, St. Orsola-Malpighi Hospital"}, "7005212716": {"Name": "Sternini C.", "AuthorID": "7005212716", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine and Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA"}}}
