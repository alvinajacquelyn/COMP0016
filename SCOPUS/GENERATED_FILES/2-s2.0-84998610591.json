However, such diversity remains difficult to document from traditional zooarchaeological methods and its study may necessitate the implementation of combined methodological approaches. An integrated dental analysis, combining kill-off patterns, traditional and geometric morphometrics, linear enamel hypoplasia (LEH), microwear and stable isotope (\u03b418O,\u03b413C, \u03b415N) data, has been performed on assemblages from the neighbouring sites of D\u00fczen Tepe and Sagalassos (SW Turkey) dated to Classical-Hellenistic to Byzantine time periods. Results indicate a diachronic evolution in slaughter practices, and a gradual decrease in pig mean size from the Early-Middle Imperial to the Byzantine. The seasonality of physiological stressing events remains the same, although their intensity varies through time. During the Early Byzantine period (CE 450\u2013700), pig demographic management is characterized by two birth seasons, and a great diversity in diet and scale of management occurred, from free-ranging pigs \u2013 whether or not given food supplement - to closely confined well-watered and more omnivorous pigs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geometric morphometrics", "Hypoplasia", "Kill-off patterns", "Pig husbandry", "\u03b413C", "\u03b415N", "\u03b418O"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998610591", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"35787837200": {"Name": "Fr\u00e9mondeau D.", "AuthorID": "35787837200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Leuven"}, "6506604649": {"Name": "De Cupere B.", "AuthorID": "6506604649", "AffiliationID": "60068588", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences"}, "55886485300": {"Name": "Van Neer W.", "AuthorID": "55886485300", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Leuven"}, "23977570900": {"Name": "Evin A.", "AuthorID": "23977570900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology Classics and Egyptology, University of Liverpool"}}}
