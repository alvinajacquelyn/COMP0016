We aimed to formulate pathways for referral into and out of weight assessment and management clinics (WAMCs) that include internal medicine/primary care physicians as part of a multidisciplinary team that could provide specialist advice and interventions, including referral for bariatric surgery. Using a National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE)-accredited process, a Guidance Development Group conducted a literature search identifying existing WAMCs. As very few examples of effective structures and clinical pathways existed, the current evidence base for optimal assessment and management of bariatric surgery patients was used to reach a consensus. The model we describe could be adopted internationally by health services to manage severely obese patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bariatric surgery", "Clinical pathways", "Obesity management", "Service access"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bariatric Surgery", "Critical Pathways", "Disease Management", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Obesity, Morbid", "Patient Care Team", "Referral and Consultation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959119597", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"16417761600": {"Name": "Welbourn R.", "AuthorID": "16417761600", "AffiliationID": "60006737", "AffiliationName": "Department of Upper GI and Bariatric Surgery, Musgrove Park Hospital"}, "36014175500": {"Name": "Dixon J.", "AuthorID": "36014175500", "AffiliationID": "60033409", "AffiliationName": "Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute"}, "7202739518": {"Name": "Barth J.H.", "AuthorID": "7202739518", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Pathology and Metabolic Medicine, Leeds General Infirmary"}, "35461137000": {"Name": "Finer N.", "AuthorID": "35461137000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Centre for Weight Loss, Metabolic and Endocrine Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "57037792600": {"Name": "Hughes C.A.", "AuthorID": "57037792600", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Fakenham Weight Management Service, University of East Anglia"}, "56962726600": {"Name": "le Roux C.W.", "AuthorID": "56962726600", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "Conway Institute, Diabetes Complications Research Centre, University College Dublin"}, "7103324354": {"Name": "Wass J.", "AuthorID": "7103324354", "AffiliationID": "60008239", "AffiliationName": "Royal College of Physicians of London"}}}
