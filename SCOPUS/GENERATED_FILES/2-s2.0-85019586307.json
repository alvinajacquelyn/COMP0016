Extending previous work, focused on independent estimation, here we deal with the question of joint estimation of multiple skew-spectra from the same or correlated data sets. We consider the optimum skew-spectra for various models of primordial non-Gaussianity as well as secondary bispectra that originate from the cross-correlation of secondaries and lensing ofCMB: coupling of lensing with the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, coupling of lensing with thermal Sunyaev- Zeldovich, as well as from unresolved point sources. For joint estimation of various types of non-Gaussianity, we use the principal component analysis (PCA) to construct the linear combinations of amplitudes of various models of non-Gaussianity, e.g. f NLloc, f NL eq, f NLortho that can be estimated from CMB maps. We describe how the bias induced in the estimation of primordial non-Gaussianity due to secondary non-Gaussianity may be evaluated for arbitrary primordial models using a PCA analysis. The PCA approach allows one to infer approximate (but generally accurate) constraints using CMB data sets on any reasonably smooth model by use of a look-up table and performing a simple computation. This principle is validated by computing constraints on the Dirac-Born-Infeld bispectrum using a PCA analysis of the standard templates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmic background radiation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019586307", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"36343995700": {"Name": "Regan D.", "AuthorID": "36343995700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "35318355900": {"Name": "Munshi D.", "AuthorID": "35318355900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Centre, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}}}
