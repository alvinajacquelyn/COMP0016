In fact, sub-acute complications cannot be directly related to the severity of the calcification in the host tissues, nor with catheter manipulation during the implant. A potential cause could be local flow perturbations introduced by the implantation approach, resulting in thrombo-embolic consequences. In particular, contrary to the surgical approach, TAVI preserves the presence of the native leaflets, which are expanded in the paravalvular space inside the Valsalva sinuses. The purpose of this study is to verify if this configuration can determine hemodynamic variations which may promote blood cell aggregation and thrombus formation. Methods The study was performed in vitro, on idealized models of the patient anatomy before and after TAVI, reproducing a range of physiological operating conditions on a pulse duplicator. The fluid dynamics in the Valsalva sinuses was analyzed and characterized using phase resolved Particle Image Velocimetry. Results Comparison of the flow downstream the valve clearly indicated major alterations in the fluid mechanics after TAVI, characterized by unphysiological conditions associated with extended stagnation zones at the base of the sinuses. Conclusion The prolonged stasis observed in the Valsalva sinuses for the configuration modelling the presence of transcatheter aortic valves provides a fluid dynamic environment favourable for red blood cell aggregation and thrombus formation, which may justify some of the recently reported thromboembolic and ischemic events. This suggests the adoption of anticoagulation therapies following TAVI, and some caution in the patients\u05f3 selection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood stagnation", "Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV)", "Thrombo-embolism", "Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)", "Valsalva sinus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticoagulation therapy", "Dynamic environments", "Operating condition", "Particle image velocimetries", "Red blood cell aggregation", "Thrombo-embolism", "Transcatheter aortic valves", "Valsalva sinus", "Aortic Valve", "Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Heart Valve Prosthesis", "Humans", "Hydrodynamics", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Regional Blood Flow", "Rheology", "Thromboembolism", "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006150703", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"8259228300": {"Name": "Ducci A.", "AuthorID": "8259228300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cardiovascular Engineering Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering"}, "57192391291": {"Name": "Pirisi F.", "AuthorID": "57192391291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cardiovascular Engineering Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering"}, "25928854300": {"Name": "Tzamtzis S.", "AuthorID": "25928854300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cardiovascular Engineering Laboratory, UCL Mechanical Engineering"}, "6506017118": {"Name": "Burriesci G.", "AuthorID": "6506017118", "AffiliationID": "113264399", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Ri.MED, Bioengineering Group"}}}
