The problem is a generalisation of classic Hele-Shaw free boundary flow or Laplacian growth problem and has many applications. In the case when the right hand side of Poisson\u2019s equation is constant, a formulation is obtained in terms of the Schwarz function of the free boundary. From this it is deduced that solutions of the Laplacian growth problem also satisfy the Poisson growth problem, the only difference being in their time evolution. The corresponding moment evolution equations, a Polubarinova\u2013Galin type equation and a Baiocchi-type transformation for Poisson growth are also presented. Some explicit examples are given, one in which cusp formation is inhibited by the addition of the Poisson term, and another for a growing finger in which the Poisson term selects the width of the finger to be half that of the channel. For the more complicated case when the right hand side is linear in one space direction, the Schwarz function method is used to derive an exact solution describing a translating circular blob with changing radius.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hele-Shaw flows", "Laplacian growth"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937830516", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"]], "AuthorData": {"56735373900": {"Name": "McDonald R.", "AuthorID": "56735373900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6603497725": {"Name": "Mineev-Weinstein M.", "AuthorID": "6603497725", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "New Mexico Consortium"}}}
