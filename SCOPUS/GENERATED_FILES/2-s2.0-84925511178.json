However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected in the past were generally qualitative in nature. Our objective was to investigate white matter microstructure pathology and examine correlations with outcome and behaviour in this disease, by using multi-shell diffusion weighted imaging. In addition to standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) was used to estimate density and orientation dispersion of neurites in a group of eight patients (aged 16\u201321 years) and eight healthy controls (aged 15\u201320 years). Extensive white matter abnormalities were found: neurite density index (NDI) was lower in the patient group in bilateral anterior areas, and orientation dispersion index (ODI) was increased mainly in the left hemisphere. These specific regional profiles are in agreement with the cognitive profile observed in galactosemia, showing higher order cognitive impairments, and language and motor impairments, respectively. Less favourable white matter properties correlated positively with age and age at onset of diet, and negatively with behavioural outcome (e.g. visual working memory). To conclude, this study provides evidence of white matter pathology regarding density and dispersion of neurites in these patients. The results are discussed in light of suggested pathophysiological mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Brain Mapping", "Case-Control Studies", "Cognition", "Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Galactosemias", "Humans", "Language", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Neurites", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "White Matter", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925511178", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"39262599200": {"Name": "Timmers I.", "AuthorID": "39262599200", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "55295726500": {"Name": "Bastiani M.", "AuthorID": "55295726500", "AffiliationID": "112617259", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht Brain Imaging Center (M-BIC)"}, "6506330017": {"Name": "Jansma B.", "AuthorID": "6506330017", "AffiliationID": "112617259", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht Brain Imaging Center (M-BIC)"}, "6508170986": {"Name": "Roebroeck A.", "AuthorID": "6508170986", "AffiliationID": "112617259", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht Brain Imaging Center (M-BIC)"}, "6701639713": {"Name": "Rubio-Gozalbo M.", "AuthorID": "6701639713", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "36088339000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36088339000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
