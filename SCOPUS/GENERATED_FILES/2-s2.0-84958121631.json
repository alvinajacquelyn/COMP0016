Clinicians' experiences and challenges of talking to patients about HPV have yet to be explored. Methods Fifteen health professionals caring for patients with oropharyngeal SCC were interviewed. Interviews were analyzed thematically. Results Participants expressed mixed views about explaining the causal role of HPV to their patients. Normalizing HPV and emphasizing the positive prognosis associated with it were regarded as key messages to be communicated. Challenging experiences included managing couples in a consultation and patients' concerns about transmitting HPV to their partners. Some participants described limitations to their HPV knowledge and identified the need for further information and training. Conclusion This study identified challenges experienced by health professionals working with patients with oropharyngeal SCC and highlights some key messages to convey to patients. Clinical guidance for health professionals and further information for patients about HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["communication", "health professionals", "human papillomavirus (HPV)", "oropharyngeal cancer", "qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Carcinoma, Squamous Cell", "Female", "Head and Neck Neoplasms", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oropharyngeal Neoplasms", "Papillomaviridae", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Prognosis", "Qualitative Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958121631", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"56003410500": {"Name": "Dodd R.", "AuthorID": "56003410500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Cancer Research United Kingdom, Health Behaviour Research Centre"}, "6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Cancer Research United Kingdom, Health Behaviour Research Centre"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Cancer Research United Kingdom, Health Behaviour Research Centre"}}}
