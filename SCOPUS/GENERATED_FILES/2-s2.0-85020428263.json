This approach is based on the identification of low axillary burden on sentinel node biopsy (SNB). The modern practice of routine pre-operative axillary ultrasound has meant that patients are \u2018fast tracked\u2019 to axillary node clearance (ANC) in the presence of a histologically confirmed positive axilla. This practice reduces the number of patients undergoing SNB compared to the original trials, which evaluated the role of SNB, and those assessing safety of omission of ANC in low axillary burden. The risk of depriving patients with low axillary burden the opportunity to avoid ANC as a consequence of pre-operative ultrasound is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axillary node clearance", "Axillary ultrasound", "Breast cancer", "Low axillary burden", "Sentinel node biopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Axilla", "Breast Neoplasms", "Female", "Humans", "Lymph Nodes", "Preoperative Care", "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020428263", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57220821601": {"Name": "Ahmed M.", "AuthorID": "57220821601", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, Research Oncology, King\u2019s College London"}, "57194430639": {"Name": "Jozsa F.", "AuthorID": "57194430639", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, Research Oncology, King\u2019s College London"}, "8415555100": {"Name": "Douek M.", "AuthorID": "8415555100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, Research Oncology, King\u2019s College London"}}}
