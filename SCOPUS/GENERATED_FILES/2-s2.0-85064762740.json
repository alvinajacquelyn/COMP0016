Biomarkers of cellular senescence have been shown to increase with age and degeneration of human disc tissue. Senescent disc cells in culture recapitulate features associated with age-related disc degeneration, including increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, matrix proteases, and fragmentation of matrix proteins. However, little is known of the metabolic changes that underlie the senescent phenotype of disc cells. To assess the metabolic changes, we performed a bioenergetic analysis of in vitro oxidative stress-induced senescent (SIS)human disc cells. SIS disc cells acquire SASP and exhibit significantly elevated mitochondrial content and mitochondrial ATP-linked respiration. The metabolic changes appear to be driven by the upregulated protein secretion in SIS cells as abrogation of protein synthesis using cycloheximide decreased mitochondrial ATP-linked respiration. Taken together, the results of the study suggest that the increased energy generation state supports the secretion of senescent associated proteins in SIS disc cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Bioenergetics", "Cellular senescence", "Intervertebral disc degeneration", "Matrix homeostasis", "Mitochondria"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cellular Senescence", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Humans", "Intervertebral Disc", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative Stress", "Oxygen Consumption"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064762740", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57190579403": {"Name": "Patil P.", "AuthorID": "57190579403", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "57208428149": {"Name": "Lee D.", "AuthorID": "57208428149", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "55870592800": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "55870592800", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "57208422021": {"Name": "Gwendolyn S.", "AuthorID": "57208422021", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "23493809800": {"Name": "Vo N.", "AuthorID": "23493809800", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "57210626898": {"Name": "Falabella M.", "AuthorID": "57210626898", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "57208427588": {"Name": "Saeed A.", "AuthorID": "57208427588", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "7102639872": {"Name": "Kaufman B.", "AuthorID": "7102639872", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "7004561028": {"Name": "Shiva S.", "AuthorID": "7004561028", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Medicine Institute, University of Pittsburgh"}, "6507821786": {"Name": "Croix C.", "AuthorID": "6507821786", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Center for Biological Imaging, Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, University of Pittsburgh"}, "57200296697": {"Name": "Van Houten B.", "AuthorID": "57200296697", "AffiliationID": "60026906", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Hillman Cancer Research Pavilion"}, "57203024508": {"Name": "Niedernhofer L.", "AuthorID": "57203024508", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Institute on the Biology of Aging and Metabolism, Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota"}, "17339473100": {"Name": "Robbins P.", "AuthorID": "17339473100", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Institute on the Biology of Aging and Metabolism, Department of Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, University of Minnesota"}}}
