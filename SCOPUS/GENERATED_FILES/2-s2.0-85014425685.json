University students (N = 359) completed the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control and General Self-Efficacy scales. The three-factor model had better fit and parsimony in both Forms. \u2018Internal\u2019 scale negatively correlated with \u2018chance\u2019 but positively with \u2018others\u2019. The two external scales positively correlated. The scales\u2019 reliability was satisfactory, but the two Forms were not psychometrically equivalent. Convergent validity was confirmed. The evidence suggests a three-factor structure and psychometric non-equivalence of the two Forms. Researchers should make an informed choice on which Form to use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Confirmatory factor analysis", "Multidimensional Health Locus of Control", "Reliability", "Self-efficacy", "Validity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014425685", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56310663400": {"Name": "Kassianos A.P.", "AuthorID": "56310663400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57193509838": {"Name": "Symeou M.", "AuthorID": "57193509838", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "University of Cyprus"}, "55336406000": {"Name": "Ioannou M.", "AuthorID": "55336406000", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "University of Cyprus"}}}
