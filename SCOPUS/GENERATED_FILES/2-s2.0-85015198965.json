In this paper, we propose a full reference stereo image quality assessment (SIQA) framework which focuses on the innovation of binocular visual properties and applications of low-level features. On one hand, based on the fact that human visual system understands an image mainly according to its low-level features, local phase and local amplitude extracted from phase congruency measurement are employed as primary features. Considering the less prominent performance of amplitude in IQA, visual saliency is applied into the modification on amplitude. On the other hand, by fully considering binocular rivalry phenomena, we create the cyclopean amplitude map and cyclopean phase map. With this method, both image features and binocular visual properties are mutually combined with each other. Meanwhile, a novel binocular modulation function in spatial domain is also adopted into the overall quality prediction of amplitude and phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher consistency with subjective tests than relevant SIQA metrics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amplitude and phase", "binocular visual properties", "human visual system", "phase congruency", "stereo image quality assessment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amplitude and phase", "Human Visual System", "Phase congruency", "Stereo-image", "Visual properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015198965", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56645140800": {"Name": "Lin Y.", "AuthorID": "56645140800", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "25959803600": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "25959803600", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "55484285200": {"Name": "Lu W.", "AuthorID": "55484285200", "AffiliationID": "60025578", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University"}, "7202535582": {"Name": "Meng Q.", "AuthorID": "7202535582", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, School of Science, Loughborough University"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60000937, 60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen University Town"}, "57199094588": {"Name": "Song H.", "AuthorID": "57199094588", "AffiliationID": "60021143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Virginia University"}}}
