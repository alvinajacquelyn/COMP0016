Nanosecond-reconfigurable, scalable photonic switch fabrics and advances in photonic integration are key enablers for optical packet switching. However, the control plane and in particular the switch scheduler is believed to be a critical factor on packet latency and scalability. To that end, we report a low-latency scheduler for Clos-network switch fabrics based on a fixed path assignment scheme and parallel and distributed path arbitration. Cycle-accurate network emulation results show nanosecond average latency at input port loads up to 60% of capacity for a 256x256 switch size. In comparison to previous work, the scheduler can now control a switch 8 times the size at double the input port saturation load for the same average latency. Scaling the switch from 16 to 256 ports shows only a small drop in saturation load from 70% to 60%. Also fairness on a per flow basis is demonstrated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clos-network switch", "optical packet switching", "switch scheduling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clos networks", "Distributed schedulers", "Network emulation", "Optical networking", "Optical packet switching", "Photonic integrations", "Switch schedulers", "Switch scheduling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058017909", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56681188200": {"Name": "Andreades P.", "AuthorID": "56681188200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Electronic Electrical Engineering University, College London"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Electronic Electrical Engineering University, College London"}}}
