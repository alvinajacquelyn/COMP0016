In order to assess the immunogenicity of pneumococcal proteins and polysaccharide, we investigated protein and serotype-specific antibody responses after HIV-associated IPD. Methods. Specific antipneumococcal immunoglobulin G to 27 pneumococcal protein antigens and 30 serotype polysaccharides was measured in plasma before and after IPD in HIV-infected individuals and compared to HIVinfected individuals without IPD. Results. Over time, 81% of IPD cases responded to at least 1 protein compared to 51% of non-IPD controls. HIV IPD cases responded to more proteins than non-IPD controls (8.6 \u00b1 8.4 vs 4.2 \u00b1 7.6 proteins; P = .01), and had a significantly higher probability of yielding an antibody response to the proteins PiaA, PsaA, and PcpA. Twentytwo percent of HIV-infected individuals with IPD had a serotype-specific antibody response. Younger age at the time of IPD was the only predictor of a serotype-specific pneumococcal antibody response, whereas we did not identify predictors of a protein-specific antibody response. Conclusions. Antibody responses occurred more frequently to pneumococcal proteins than to polysaccharide, and protein antibodies persisted for longer than polysaccharide-specific antibodies. PcpA, PiaA, and PsaA were the most immunogenic proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibody", "HAART", "HIV", "IPD", "pneumococcal vaccines", "pneumococcus", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adhesins, Bacterial", "Adult", "Antibodies, Bacterial", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Bacterial Proteins", "Carrier Proteins", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Lipoproteins", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Polysaccharides", "Serogroup", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943368601", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"25960977500": {"Name": "Kants\u00f8 B.", "AuthorID": "25960977500", "AffiliationID": "60025543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiological Diagnostics and Virology, Statens Serum Institut"}, "20234361300": {"Name": "Green N.", "AuthorID": "20234361300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7102190212": {"Name": "Goldblatt D.", "AuthorID": "7102190212", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006806129": {"Name": "Benfield T.", "AuthorID": "7006806129", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}}}
