While growth factors are commonly used with biomaterials to promote angiogenesis, some ions released from biomaterials can also contribute to angiogenic events. Many silica-based biomaterials have been widely used for the repair and regeneration of tissues, mainly hard tissues such as bone and tooth structure. They have shown excellent performance in bone formation by stimulating angiogenesis. The release of silicate and others (Co and Cu ions) has therefore been implicated to play critical roles in the angiogenesis process. In this short review, we highlight the in vitro and in vivo findings of angiogenesis (and the related bone formation) stimulated by the various types of siliconcontaining biomaterials where silicate ions released might play essential roles. We discuss further the possible molecular mechanisms underlying in the ion-induced angiogenic events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Bone stimulation", "Silicate ions", "Silicon-containing biomaterials"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055682220", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55783141000": {"Name": "Dashnyam K.", "AuthorID": "55783141000", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science and BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University"}, "37109659900": {"Name": "El-Fiqi A.", "AuthorID": "37109659900", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science and BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University"}, "56689669100": {"Name": "Buitrago J.O.", "AuthorID": "56689669100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science and BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University"}, "35181836700": {"Name": "Perez R.A.", "AuthorID": "35181836700", "AffiliationID": "60068651", "AffiliationName": "UIC Regenerative Medicine Research Institute, Universitat Internacional de Catalunya"}, "56591525500": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "56591525500", "AffiliationID": "60170568, 60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials Science, School of Dentistry, Dankook University"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
