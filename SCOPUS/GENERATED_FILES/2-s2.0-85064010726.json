Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of SSIEM Pegunigalsidase alfa, a novel PEGylated, covalently crosslinked form of \u03b1-galactosidase A developed as enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for Fabry disease (FD), was designed to increase plasma half-life and reduce immunogenicity, thereby enhancing efficacy compared with available products. Symptomatic adults with FD participated in this open-label, 3-month dose-ranging study, followed by a 9-month extension. Three cohorts were enrolled in a stepwise manner, each receiving increased doses of pegunigalsidase alfa: 0.2, 1.0, 2.0 mg/kg, via intravenous infusion every other week. Pharmacokinetic analysis occurred on Day 1 and Months 3, 6, and 12. Kidney biopsies at baseline and Month 6 assessed peritubular capillary globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) content. Renal function, cardiac parameters, and other clinical endpoints were assessed throughout. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antidrug antibodies (ADAs) were assessed. Sixteen patients completed 1 year's treatment. Mean terminal plasma half-life (each cohort) ranged from 53 to 121 hours. All 11 male and 1 of 7 female patients presented with classic FD phenotype, in whom renal peritubular capillary Gb3 inclusions were reduced by 84%. Mean estimated glomerular filtration rate was 111 mL/min/1.73 m 2 at baseline, remaining stable throughout treatment. Three patients developed treatment-induced IgG ADAs; following 1 year's treatment, all became ADA-negative. Nearly all treatment-emergent AEs were mild or moderate. One patient withdrew from the study following a serious related AE. Pegunigalsidase alfa may represent an advance in ERT for FD, based on its unique pharmacokinetics and apparent low immunogenicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antidrug antibodies", "enzyme replacement therapy", "Fabry disease", "immunogenicity", "pegunigalsidase alfa", "pharmacokinetics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "alpha-Galactosidase", "Enzyme Replacement Therapy", "Fabry Disease", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Heart", "Humans", "Internationality", "Kidney", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Treatment Outcome", "Trihexosylceramides", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064010726", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7006001698": {"Name": "Schiffmann R.", "AuthorID": "7006001698", "AffiliationID": "60031742", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metabolic Disease, 3812 Elm Street"}, "6507595392": {"Name": "Goker-Alpan O.", "AuthorID": "6507595392", "AffiliationID": "118296901", "AffiliationName": "Lysosomal Disorders Research and Treatment Unit, O&O Alpan LLC"}, "6603323013": {"Name": "Holida M.", "AuthorID": "6603323013", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Medical Genetics-Lysosomal Storage Disorders, University of Iowa"}, "7007060971": {"Name": "Giraldo P.", "AuthorID": "7007060971", "AffiliationID": "105547512", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras, Hospital de Dia Quiron"}, "22233538700": {"Name": "Barisoni L.", "AuthorID": "22233538700", "AffiliationID": "60029251", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Miami"}, "55536642300": {"Name": "Colvin R.B.", "AuthorID": "55536642300", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology Boston, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57200342207": {"Name": "Jennette C.J.", "AuthorID": "57200342207", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of North Carolina"}, "14522943200": {"Name": "Maegawa G.", "AuthorID": "14522943200", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics/Genetics & Metabolism, University of Florida"}, "7003378480": {"Name": "Boyadjiev S.A.", "AuthorID": "7003378480", "AffiliationID": "60114314, 60003160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Section of Genetics, MIND Institute, UC Davis Medical Center"}, "55577383800": {"Name": "Gonzalez D.", "AuthorID": "55577383800", "AffiliationID": "114790697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Instituto Privado de Hematologia e Investigaci\u00f3n Cl\u00ednica"}, "7006627484": {"Name": "Nicholls K.", "AuthorID": "7006627484", "AffiliationID": "60005245", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Department, The Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "55237052900": {"Name": "Tuffaha A.", "AuthorID": "55237052900", "AffiliationID": "60007828", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology & Hypertension, University of Kansas Medical Center"}, "7005733556": {"Name": "Atta M.G.", "AuthorID": "7005733556", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "6601958656": {"Name": "Rup B.", "AuthorID": "6601958656", "AffiliationID": "119729148", "AffiliationName": "Bioanalysis, Immunogenicity, Regulatory at Bonnie Rup Consulting LLC, Bonnie Rup Consulting LLC"}, "15047489500": {"Name": "Charney M.R.", "AuthorID": "15047489500", "AffiliationID": "122394620", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacokinetics Consultant, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacokinetics Consultant"}, "7006305093": {"Name": "Paz A.", "AuthorID": "7006305093", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Product Development, Protalix Biotherapeutics"}, "19934384700": {"Name": "Szlaifer M.", "AuthorID": "19934384700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Product Development, Protalix Biotherapeutics"}, "56678491100": {"Name": "Alon S.", "AuthorID": "56678491100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Product Development, Protalix Biotherapeutics"}, "18133666600": {"Name": "Brill-Almon E.", "AuthorID": "18133666600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Product Development, Protalix Biotherapeutics"}, "6507776646": {"Name": "Chertkoff R.", "AuthorID": "6507776646", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Product Development, Protalix Biotherapeutics"}, "55186237200": {"Name": "Hughes D.", "AuthorID": "55186237200", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, LSDU, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
