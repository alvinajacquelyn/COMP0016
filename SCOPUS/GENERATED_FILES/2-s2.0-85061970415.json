We present our experience that combines a conventional molecular diagnostic approach with the complementary use of a DNA methylation-based classification tool, for adult brain tumours originating from local as well as national referrals. We report the frequency of IDH mutations in a large cohort of nearly 1550 patients, EGFR amplifications in almost 1900 IDH-wildtype glioblastomas, and histone mutations in 70 adult gliomas. We demonstrate how additional methylation-based classification has changed and improved our diagnostic approach. Of the 325 cases referred for methylome testing, 179 (56%) had a calibrated score of 0.84 and higher and were included in the evaluation. In these 179 samples, the diagnosis was changed in 45 (25%), refined in 86 (48%) and confirmed in 44 cases (25%). In addition, the methylation arrays contain copy number information that usefully complements the methylation profile. For example, EGFR amplification which is 95% concordant with our Real-Time PCR-based copy number assays. We propose here a diagnostic algorithm that integrates histology, conventional molecular tests and methylation arrays.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult brain tumours", "BRAF", "Brain tumour classification", "DKFZ classifier", "Ependymoma", "Glioma", "H3 K27M", "Histone mutation", "IDH1", "IDH2", "Illumina array", "Methylation array", "Methylation classifier", "Molecular diagnostics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cohort Studies", "DNA Fingerprinting", "DNA Methylation", "Female", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061970415", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"54083212800": {"Name": "Jaunmuktane Z.", "AuthorID": "54083212800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neurosciences"}, "57206785342": {"Name": "Dutt M.", "AuthorID": "57206785342", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6508000812": {"Name": "Suraweera N.", "AuthorID": "6508000812", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006643850": {"Name": "Brandner S.", "AuthorID": "7006643850", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease"}, "8547671300": {"Name": "Capper D.", "AuthorID": "8547671300", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "55718421500": {"Name": "Jones D.T.W.", "AuthorID": "55718421500", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Glioma Research Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "36020917700": {"Name": "Sill M.", "AuthorID": "36020917700", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Neurooncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "23570821400": {"Name": "Pfister S.M.", "AuthorID": "23570821400", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Pulmonology, Heidelberg University Hospital"}, "36185975600": {"Name": "Schrimpf D.", "AuthorID": "36185975600", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "7005605204": {"Name": "von Deimling A.", "AuthorID": "7005605204", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}}}
