In comparison to the existing sampling designs, which require \u223c 2L2 samples for the representation of spin-s functions band-limited at L, the proposed scheme requires No=L2-s2 samples for the accurate computation of the spin-s spherical harmonic transform (s-SHT). For the proposed sampling scheme, we also develop a method to compute the s-SHT. We place the samples in our design scheme such that the matrices involved in the computation of s-SHT are well-conditioned. We also present a multipass s-SHT to improve the accuracy of the transform. We also show the proposed sampling design exhibits superior geometrical properties compared to existing equiangular and Gauss-Legendre sampling schemes, and enables accurate computation of the s-SHT corroborated through numerical experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Harmonic analysis", "sampling", "sphere", "spherical harmonics", "spin-s functions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate computations", "Band limited function", "Number of degrees of freedom", "Numerical experiments", "Optimal dimensionality", "S function", "Spherical harmonic transforms", "Spherical harmonics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051790359", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57193614870": {"Name": "Elahi U.", "AuthorID": "57193614870", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Engineering, College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University"}, "55760863200": {"Name": "Kennedy R.A.", "AuthorID": "55760863200", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Engineering, College of Engineering and Computer Science, Australian National University"}, "24724795700": {"Name": "Khalid Z.", "AuthorID": "24724795700", "AffiliationID": "60042311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, School of Science and Engineering, Lahore University of Management Sciences"}, "8559862200": {"Name": "McEwen J.D.", "AuthorID": "8559862200", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
