In a 1-year nonrandomized extension to the CORDELIA study, data collected from patients with myocardial siderosis provided additional information on deferasirox or deferoxamine (DFO) efficacy and safety. Myocardial (m)T2* increased from baseline 11.6 to 15.9 ms in patients receiving deferasirox for 24 months (n = 74; geometric mean [Gmean] ratio of month 24/baseline 1.38 [95% confidence interval 1.28, 1.49]) and from 10.8 to 14.2 ms in those receiving DFO (n = 29; Gmean ratio 1.33 [1.13, 1.55]; P = 0.93 between groups). Improved mT2* * with deferasirox was evident across all subgroups evaluated irrespective of baseline myocardial (mT2* < 10 vs. \u2265 10 ms) or liver (LIC <15 vs. \u226515 mg Fe/g dw) iron burden. Mean LVEF was stable and remained within normal limits with deferasirox or DFO. Liver iron concentration decreased from high baseline values of 30.6 \u00b1 18.0 to 14.4 \u00b1 16.6 mg Fe/g dw at month 24 in deferasirox patients and from 36.8 \u00b1 15.6 to 11.0 \u00b1 12.1 mg Fe/g dw in DFO patients. The long-term safety profile of deferasirox or DFO was consistent with previous reports; serious drug-related AEs were reported in 6.8% of deferasirox and 6.9% of DFO patients. Continued treatment of severely iron-overloaded beta thalassemia patients with deferasirox or DFO led to sustained improvements in myocardial iron irrespective of high or low baseline myocardial or liver iron burden, in parallel with substantial improvements in liver iron (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00600938).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Benzoates", "beta-Thalassemia", "Blood Transfusion", "Chelation Therapy", "Child", "Deferoxamine", "Female", "Humans", "Iron", "Iron Chelating Agents", "Iron Overload", "Liver", "Male", "Myocardium", "Prospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Triazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921325842", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7103221771": {"Name": "Pennell D.J.", "AuthorID": "7103221771", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7403427269": {"Name": "Porter J.B.", "AuthorID": "7403427269", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "56436936600": {"Name": "Piga A.", "AuthorID": "56436936600", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Turin"}, "7401512064": {"Name": "Lai Y.R.", "AuthorID": "7401512064", "AffiliationID": "60121618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University"}, "6603278914": {"Name": "El-Beshlawy A.", "AuthorID": "6603278914", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology, Cairo University"}, "57219783968": {"Name": "Elalfy M.", "AuthorID": "57219783968", "AffiliationID": "60016618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Ain Shams University"}, "8327807300": {"Name": "Yesilipek A.", "AuthorID": "8327807300", "AffiliationID": "60010104", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Akdeniz University"}, "7003755311": {"Name": "Kilin\u00e7 Y.", "AuthorID": "7003755311", "AffiliationID": "60032587", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Cukurova University Medical Facility"}, "14219107100": {"Name": "Habr D.", "AuthorID": "14219107100", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals"}, "56486406500": {"Name": "Shen J.", "AuthorID": "56486406500", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharmaceuticals"}, "24335608600": {"Name": "Musallam K.M.", "AuthorID": "24335608600", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "6701871501": {"Name": "Aydinok Y.", "AuthorID": "6701871501", "AffiliationID": "60009761", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology, Ege University Hospital"}}}
