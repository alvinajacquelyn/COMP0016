Here, we present a simple methodology for the formation of a free-standing viscoelastic hydrogel from the abundant and low cost protein serum albumin. We show that the mechanical properties of the hydrogel exhibit a complicated behaviour as a function of the weight fraction of the protein component. We further use X-ray scattering to shed light on the mechanism of gelation from the formation of a fibrillary network at low weight fractions to interconnected aggregates at higher weight fractions. Given the match between our hydrogel elasticity and that of the myocardium, we investigated its potential for supporting cardiac cells in vitro. Interestingly, these hydrogels support the formation of several layers of myocytes and significantly promote the maintenance of a native-like gene expression profile compared to those cultured on glass. When confronted with a multicellular ventricular cell preparation, the hydrogels can support macroscopically contracting cardiac-like tissues with a distinct cell arrangement, and form mm-long vascular-like structures. We envisage that our simple approach for the formation of an elastic substrate from an abundant protein makes the hydrogel a compelling biomedical material candidate for a wide range of cell types.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical material", "Cardiac tissue engineering", "Extracellular environments", "Gene expression profiles", "Mechanism of formation", "Protein components", "Ventricular cells", "Viscoelastic hydrogels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053466244", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"24821262200": {"Name": "Amdursky N.", "AuthorID": "24821262200", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Schulich Faculty of Chemistry, Technion Israel Institute of Technology"}, "35311235300": {"Name": "Mazo M.M.", "AuthorID": "35311235300", "AffiliationID": "60032489, 60033320", "AffiliationName": "Cell Therapy Program, Centre for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra"}, "57192977228": {"Name": "Thomas M.R.", "AuthorID": "57192977228", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College Lodon"}, "36192262900": {"Name": "Puetzer J.L.", "AuthorID": "36192262900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College Lodon"}, "7005674928": {"Name": "St-Pierre J.P.", "AuthorID": "7005674928", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College Lodon"}, "36060322700": {"Name": "Skaalure S.C.", "AuthorID": "36060322700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College Lodon"}, "7402243195": {"Name": "Stevens M.M.", "AuthorID": "7402243195", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College Lodon"}, "56681895200": {"Name": "Humphrey E.J.", "AuthorID": "56681895200", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial Centre for Translational and Experimental Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7003667695": {"Name": "Terracciano C.M.", "AuthorID": "7003667695", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial Centre for Translational and Experimental Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7401642595": {"Name": "Richardson R.M.", "AuthorID": "7401642595", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "H H Wills Physics Laboratory, University of Bristol"}}}
