Aims: The aim was to examine the psychometric properties of the 12-item Clinical Perfectionism Questionnaire (CPQ). Method: The research involved two samples. Study 1 comprised a nonclinical sample (n = 206) recruited via the internet. Study 2 comprised individuals in treatment for an eating disorder (n = 129) and a community sample (n = 80). Results: Study 1 factor analysis results indicated a two-factor structure. The CPQ had strong correlations with measures of perfectionism and psychopathology, acceptable internal consistency, and discriminative and incremental validity. The results of Study 2 suggested the same two-factor structure, acceptable internal consistency, and construct validity, with the CPQ discriminating between the eating disorder and control groups. Readability was assessed as a US grade 4 reading level (student age range 9-10 years). Conclusions: The findings provide evidence for the reliability and validity of the CPQ in a clinical eating disorder and two separate community samples. Although further research is required the CPQ has promising evidence as a reliable and valid measure of clinical perfectionism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["eating disorder", "Perfectionism", "reliability", "transdiagnostic", "validity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cognitive Therapy", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955176412", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"10143304600": {"Name": "Egan S.J.", "AuthorID": "10143304600", "AffiliationID": "60031226, 60090173", "AffiliationName": "Curtin University, School of Psychology and Speech Pathology"}, "7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Child Health"}, "27171173400": {"Name": "Lee M.", "AuthorID": "27171173400", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}, "7006603343": {"Name": "Fairburn C.G.", "AuthorID": "7006603343", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University"}, "6701463357": {"Name": "Cooper Z.", "AuthorID": "6701463357", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University"}, "7005767637": {"Name": "Doll H.A.", "AuthorID": "7005767637", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University"}, "57054794900": {"Name": "Palmer R.L.", "AuthorID": "57054794900", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester"}, "23996257700": {"Name": "Watson H.J.", "AuthorID": "23996257700", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "University of Western Australia"}}}
