A new integral sliding surface which is continuous is constructed and an integral sliding mode control scheme based on a variable gain super-twisting algorithm is presented to guarantee the well-posedness of the state trajectories between two consecutive switchings. The stability of the sliding motion is analysed by considering the descriptor redundancy and the properties of fuzzy membership functions. It is shown that the proposed variable gain super-twisting algorithm is an extension of the classical single-input case to the multi-input case. Finally, a bio-economic system is numerically simulated to verify the merits of the method proposed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Descriptor redundancies", "Economic system", "Fuzzy membership function", "Integral sliding mode control", "Sliding motions", "State trajectory", "Super twisting algorithm", "T S fuzzy descriptor system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019153423", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55367209000": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "55367209000", "AffiliationID": "60119041, 60031863", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University"}, "7406719568": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "7406719568", "AffiliationID": "60119041, 60031863", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Synthetical Automation for Process Industries, Northeastern University"}, "7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}}}
