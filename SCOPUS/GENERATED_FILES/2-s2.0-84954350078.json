Therefore, understanding how this process evolves through the lifespan could offer insights into both the aging process and the development of aging-related neurodegenerative brain diseases. This work aimed to map, in vivo for the first time with an unbiased whole-brain approach, age-related iron changes using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)\u2014a new postprocessed MRI contrast mechanism. To this end, a full QSM standardization routine was devised and a cohort of N = 116 healthy adults (20\u201379 years of age) was studied. The whole-brain and ROI analyses confirmed that the propensity of brain cells to accumulate excessive iron as a function of aging largely depends on their exact anatomical location. Whereas only patchy signs of iron scavenging were observed in white matter, strong, bilateral, and confluent QSM\u2013age associations were identified in several deep-brain nuclei\u2014chiefly the striatum and midbrain\u2014and across motor, premotor, posterior insular, superior prefrontal, and cerebellar cortices. The validity of QSM as a suitable in vivo imaging technique with which to monitor iron dysregulation in the human brain was demonstrated by confirming age-related increases in several subcortical nuclei that are known to accumulate iron with age. The study indicated that, in addition to these structures, there is a predilection for iron accumulation in the frontal lobes, which when combined with the subcortical findings, suggests that iron accumulation with age predominantly affects brain regions concerned with motor/output functions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Brain iron", "Magnetic susceptibility", "Neurodegenerative diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sex Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954350078", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"8235719600": {"Name": "Acosta-Cabronero J.", "AuthorID": "8235719600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "36840399500": {"Name": "Betts M.J.", "AuthorID": "36840399500", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "6508147821": {"Name": "Cardenas-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "6508147821", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "57189881899": {"Name": "Nestor P.J.", "AuthorID": "57189881899", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "57218132739": {"Name": "Yang S.", "AuthorID": "57218132739", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Magnetic Resonance, Otto von Guericke University"}}}
