During the Cambrian explosion, episodic radiations of major animal phyla occurred coincident with repeated carbon isotope fluctuations. However, the driver of these isotope fluctuations and potential links to environmental oxygenation are unclear. Here we report high-resolution carbon and sulfur isotope data for marine carbonates from the southeastern Siberian Platform that document the canonical explosive phase of the Cambrian radiation from ~524 to ~514 Myr ago. These analyses demonstrate a strong positive covariation between carbonate \u03b413C and carbonate-associated sulfate \u03b434S through five isotope cycles. Biogeochemical modelling suggests that this isotopic coupling reflects periodic oscillations in the atmospheric O2 and the extent of shallow-ocean oxygenation. Episodic maxima in the biodiversity of animal phyla directly coincided with these extreme oxygen perturbations. Conversely, the subsequent Botoman\u2013Toyonian animal extinction events (~514 to ~512 Myr ago) coincided with decoupled isotope records that suggest a shrinking marine sulfate reservoir and expanded shallow marine anoxia. We suggest that fluctuations in oxygen availability in the shallow marine realm exerted a primary control on the timing and tempo of biodiversity radiations at a crucial phase in the early history of animal life.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065318799", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57190178443": {"Name": "He T.", "AuthorID": "57190178443", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "57204707349": {"Name": "Pogge von Strandmann P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204707349", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60162131, 60162128, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), Institute of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "14626549300": {"Name": "Shields G.A.", "AuthorID": "14626549300", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60162131, 60162128, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), Institute of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "54412572000": {"Name": "Mills B.J.W.", "AuthorID": "54412572000", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "7004422917": {"Name": "Poulton S.W.", "AuthorID": "7004422917", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "18042674000": {"Name": "Zhu M.", "AuthorID": "18042674000", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "College of Earth Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7006216382": {"Name": "Wynn P.M.", "AuthorID": "7006216382", "AffiliationID": "60117630, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University"}, "7101701905": {"Name": "Zhuravlev A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7101701905", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Evolution, Faculty of Biology, Lomonosov Moscow State University"}, "56230177600": {"Name": "Tostevin R.", "AuthorID": "56230177600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "49261308200": {"Name": "Yang A.", "AuthorID": "49261308200", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University"}}}
