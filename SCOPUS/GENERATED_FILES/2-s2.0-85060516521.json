The method has a local conservation property. We derive a priori error estimates using known conditional stability estimates and determine the minimal amount of weakly consistent stabilization and Tikhonov regularization that yields optimal convergence for smooth exact solutions. The effect of perturbations in data is also accounted for. A reduced version of the method, obtained by choosing a special stabilization of the dual variable, can be viewed as a variant of the least squares mixed finite element method introduced by Dard\u00e9, Hannukainen, and Hyv\u00f6nen in [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 51(2013), pp. 2123-2148]. The main difference is that our choice of regularization does not depend on auxiliary parameters, the mesh size being the only asymptotic parameter. Finally, we show that the reduced method can be used for defect correction iteration to determine the solution of the full method. The theory is illustrated by some numerical examples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Elliptic Cauchy problem", "Inverse problem", "Mixed finite element method", "Primaldual method", "Stabilized methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotic parameters", "Cauchy problems", "Conditional stability", "Mixed finite element methods", "Primal-dual methods", "Priori error estimate", "Stabilized method", "Tikhonov regularization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060516521", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7004271452": {"Name": "Burman E.", "AuthorID": "7004271452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "36241865400": {"Name": "Oksanen L.", "AuthorID": "36241865400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7203022296": {"Name": "Larson M.", "AuthorID": "7203022296", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
