U-Th dating shows that a relative chronology based on laminae correlation can be inaccurate: a hiatus in one of the stalagmites was not recognised, as well as more subtle changes in growth rates. Use of the stratigraphic correlation alone resulted in significant differences in the timing of stable isotopes and trace element peaks, with implications for their interpretation. Our results reveal the importance of a robust and direct chronology with which to interpret proxy data. Poor relative chronologies can lead to a misinterpretation of palaeoclimate data. The study reveals potential implications for speleothem records where proxy data and samples for dating were not taken in close proximity to each other and/or were correlated via laminae over distances of more than a few centimetres.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central Europe", "Chronology", "Coeval stalagmites", "Holocene", "Palaeoclimate", "Slovakia", "Stable isotopes", "Trace elements", "Twin stalagmites", "U-series", "Western Carpathians"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032739472", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"55656158500": {"Name": "Benson A.", "AuthorID": "55656158500", "AffiliationID": "60005807", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Department of Human Evolution"}, "55725685500": {"Name": "Hoffmann D.", "AuthorID": "55725685500", "AffiliationID": "60005807", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Department of Human Evolution"}, "56042282000": {"Name": "Bella P.", "AuthorID": "56042282000", "AffiliationID": "60091385", "AffiliationName": "Catholic University in Ru\u017eomberok, Pedagogical Faculty, Department of Geography"}, "57078327600": {"Name": "Drury A.", "AuthorID": "57078327600", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "MARUM, University of Bremen"}, "7102823761": {"Name": "Atkinson T.", "AuthorID": "7102823761", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55959631800": {"Name": "Hercman H.", "AuthorID": "55959631800", "AffiliationID": "60086648, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geological Sciences, Polish Academy of Sciences"}}}
