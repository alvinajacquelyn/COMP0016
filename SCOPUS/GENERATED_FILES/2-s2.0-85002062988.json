We propose an energy-aware optimization of the power control, the packet transmission and the topology control in WSNs. An optimization problem of minimizing the energy consumption, which incorporates the power control, the packet transmission through error correcting codes (ECC) and the topology control fulfilling specific coverage constraints, is formulated. The considered joint optimization problem is proved NP-complete and for that reason a heuristic method based on SA is applied. By applying SA algorithm, an updated topology is evaluated at any convergence point and thus a near-optimal transmit power and packet length, in conjunction with node placements is achieved jointly. Our results confirm that the proposed near optimal topology deployment proposed by SA leads to greater network coverage and lower energy consumption as compared to a Random Sampling (RS) heuristic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross layer energy analysis", "Optimization", "Simulated Annealing", "Wireless sensor networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Convergence points", "Coverage constraints", "Energy analysis", "Energy-aware optimizations", "Error correcting code", "Joint optimization", "Optimization problems", "Packet transmissions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002062988", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55608777700": {"Name": "Xenakis A.", "AuthorID": "55608777700", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly"}, "55952568500": {"Name": "Foukalas F.", "AuthorID": "55952568500", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly"}, "7003773174": {"Name": "Stamoulis G.", "AuthorID": "7003773174", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Thessaly"}}}
