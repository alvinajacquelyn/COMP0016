I use the case of an Indian Pakistani community in the UK and the USA (sometimes referred to as \u2018Bihari\u2019) to examine how historical memories of conflict are narrated in diaspora and the impact this has on the presence or absence of \u2018diasporic consciousness'. The significance of memory in diasporic and transnational communities has been neglected, especially where the narration of historical events is concerned. The impact of forgetting has received particularly scant attention. I argue that, in the absence of this story, important lessons about the role of history in the formation of community are obscured. In this example, the \u2018latent\u2019 identities created on diaspora's demobilization help us to unpick the dyadic relations of \u2018home\u2019 and \u2018away\u2019 at the heart of essentialist conceptualizations of the concept.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DIASPORIC CONSCIOUSNESS", "DIASPORIC IDENTITY", "HISTORIES OF CONFLICT", "MEMORY", "SOUTH ASIAN DIASPORA", "\u2018BIHARI\u2019"], "IndexKeywords": ["'BIHARI", "DIASPORIC CONSCIOUSNESS", "DIASPORIC IDENTITY", "Dyadic relations", "nocv1", "SOUTH ASIAN DIASPORA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005950569", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"36659693600": {"Name": "Redclift V.", "AuthorID": "36659693600", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60172390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS), University of Surrey"}}}
