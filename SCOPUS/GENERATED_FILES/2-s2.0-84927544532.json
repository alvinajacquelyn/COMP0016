In line with wider cultural trends (in the UK, at least), one of the most prominent \u2018accountability strategies\u2019 used by this group of mothers to explain their full-term breastfeeding is the claim that this is \u2018most natural\u2019, drawing on an evolutionary \u2018hominid blueprint\u2019 of care, as well as an ecological perspective on social life more broadly. What follows in the paper is a reflection on how notions of \u2018natural\u2019 parenting are given credence in narratives of mothering, and how this is used adaptively in local contexts as part of women's \u2018identity work\u2019. If in the UK the \u2018natural\u2019 is used as a moral grounding for action, the same cannot be said for women in France. Using a comparative perspective, the argument is that this reflects very different trajectories within the feminist movement in the UK and France. Where in certain mileux in the UK it is considered desirable, even mandatory, to \u2018get in touch with\u2019 nature, in France, it is considered something to escape, subordinate, and resist. Far from being \u2018flattened\u2019, then, the purchase of nature as it relates to moral negotiations of mothering appears to be stronger than ever.1", "AuthorKeywords": ["accountability", "adaptation", "Attachment parenting", "full-term breastfeeding", "identity work"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927544532", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"36157708400": {"Name": "Faircloth C.", "AuthorID": "36157708400", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "University of Roehampton"}}}
