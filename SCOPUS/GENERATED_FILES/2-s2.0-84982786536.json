Real-world social inference features much different parameters: People often encounter and learn about particular social targets (e.g., friends) over time and receive feedback about whether their inferences are correct or incorrect. Here, we examined this process and, more broadly, the intersection between social cognition and reinforcement learning. Perceivers were scanned using fMRI while repeatedly encountering three social targets who produced conflicting visual and verbal emotional cues. Perceivers guessed how targets felt and received feedback about whether they had guessed correctly. Visual cues reliably predicted one target\u2019s emotion, verbal cues predicted a second target\u2019s emotion, and neither reliably predicted the third target\u2019s emotion. Perceivers successfully used this information to update their judgments over time. Furthermore, trial-by-trial learning signals\u2014estimated using two reinforcement learning models\u2014tracked activity in ventral striatum and ventromedial pFC, structures associated with reinforcement learning, and regions associated with updating social impressions, including TPJ. These data suggest that learning about others\u2019 emotions, like other forms of feedback learning, relies on domain-general reinforcement mechanisms as well as domain-specific social information processing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Domain specific", "Feedback learning", "Internal state", "Reinforcement learning models", "Reinforcement mechanisms", "Single shots", "Social cognition", "Social information processing", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cues", "Emotions", "Feedback, Psychological", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Reinforcement (Psychology)", "Social Perception", "Speech Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982786536", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"18134766700": {"Name": "Zaki J.", "AuthorID": "18134766700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University"}, "55581495300": {"Name": "Kallman S.", "AuthorID": "55581495300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}, "6603738607": {"Name": "Ochsner K.", "AuthorID": "6603738607", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}, "57207609358": {"Name": "Shohamy D.", "AuthorID": "57207609358", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}, "56403328100": {"Name": "Elliott Wimmer G.", "AuthorID": "56403328100", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}}}
