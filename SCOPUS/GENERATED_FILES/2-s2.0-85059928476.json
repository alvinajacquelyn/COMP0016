Fine astrocytic processes that can be found in the vicinity of synapses undergo considerable structural plasticity associated with age- and use-dependent changes in neural circuitries. However, due to the extraordinary complex, essentially nanoscopic morphology of astroglia, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we detail a super-resolution microscopy approach, based on the single-molecule localisation microscopy (SMLM) technique direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) to visualize astroglial morphology on the nanoscale. This approach enables visualization of key morphological changes that occur in nanoscopic astrocyte processes, whose characteristic size falls below the diffraction limit of conventional optical microscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrocytes", "Brain tissue fixation", "dSTORM", "Immunohistochemistry", "SMLM", "Super-resolution microscopy", "Tissue sectioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Brain", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Immunohistochemistry", "Microscopy", "Molecular Imaging", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059928476", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"26653485700": {"Name": "Heller J.", "AuthorID": "26653485700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London, Queen Square"}, "7005393308": {"Name": "Rusakov D.", "AuthorID": "7005393308", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Brain Microcircuits, Institute of Neuroscience, University of Nizhny Novgorod"}}}
