Whilst SS-hAFSCs are routinely expanded in mesenchymal-type (MT) conditions, we previously showed that they acquire broader differentiation potential when cultured under embryonic-type (ET) conditions. However, the effects of culture conditions on RS-hAFSCs have not been determined. Here, we show that culturing RS-hAFSCs under ET conditions confers faster proliferation and enhances the efficiency of osteogenic differentiation of the cells. We show that this occurs via TGF\u03b2-induced activation of CD73 and the associated increase in the generation of extracellular adenosine. Our data demonstrate that culture conditions are decisive for the expansion of hAFSCs and that TGF\u03b2 present in ET conditions causes the phenotype of RS-hAFSCs to revert to an earlier state of stemness. Cultivating RS-hAFSCs in ET conditions with TGF\u03b2 may therefore increase their therapeutic potential for clinical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["5'-Nucleotidase", "Adenosine", "Amniotic Fluid", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Humans", "Osteogenesis", "Stem Cells", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026310337", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57147342200": {"Name": "Hau K.L.", "AuthorID": "57147342200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Research Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, University College London"}, "57192643871": {"Name": "Ranzoni A.M.", "AuthorID": "57192643871", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Research Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, University College London"}, "57195215813": {"Name": "Vlahova F.", "AuthorID": "57195215813", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Research Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, University College London"}, "57125654700": {"Name": "Hawkins K.", "AuthorID": "57125654700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Research Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, University College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Research Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, University College London"}, "17034676900": {"Name": "Guillot P.V.", "AuthorID": "17034676900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Research Department of Maternal and Fetal Medicine, University College London"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
