Design Retrospective interventional case series. Methods A 13-year retrospective chart review of Group D eyes treated initially with intravenous chemotherapy (IVC) and followed up for at least 1 year from last treatment. Risk factors for final visual acuity (VA) were analyzed, and rate of strabismus and nystagmus at last follow-up visit were calculated. Results One hundred and four Group D eyes (92 patients) presented to our center during the study period, of which 32 (27 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Following IVC (vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin), adjuvant treatments included intraophthalmic artery chemotherapy in 5 (16%) eyes, plaque brachytherapy in 5 (16%), transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT) in 18 (56%), and cryotherapy in 24 (75%) eyes. On last examination, 64.41 \u00b1 6.76 months from presentation, mean final VA was 20/283 (logMAR equivalent of 1.15 \u00b1 0.15). On univariate analysis, presentation age, foveal retinoblastoma (at initial examination), use of TTT, and tumor\u2013foveola distance (at last visit) were found to be significant risk factors for worse VA (P < .026). On multivariate analysis, however, only TTT was found to be significant (P = .010). At last visit, 6 of 27 (22%) patients had nystagmus and 12 of 20 (60%) bilaterally salvaged patients had strabismus (n = 10 exotropia and n = 2 esotropia). Conclusions After multimodality treatments initiated with IVC, 50% of salvaged Group D retinoblastoma eyes had <20/200 vision, with TTT being a risk factor for worse vision; 60% had strabismus; and 22% had nystagmus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Combined Modality Therapy", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Neoplasm Staging", "Nystagmus, Pathologic", "Retinal Neoplasms", "Retinoblastoma", "Retrospective Studies", "Strabismus", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019857123", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"35310047800": {"Name": "Fabian I.D.", "AuthorID": "35310047800", "AffiliationID": "60005681, 60011766", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Goldschleger Eye Institute, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University"}, "51864897600": {"Name": "Stacey A.W.", "AuthorID": "51864897600", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington"}, "7402242349": {"Name": "Reddy M.A.", "AuthorID": "7402242349", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Retinoblastoma Service, Royal London Hospital"}, "57203054292": {"Name": "Sagoo M.S.", "AuthorID": "57203054292", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172674, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57194380626": {"Name": "Naeem Z.", "AuthorID": "57194380626", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Retinoblastoma Service, Royal London Hospital"}, "57113174400": {"Name": "Chowdhury T.", "AuthorID": "57113174400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57193552326": {"Name": "Duncan C.", "AuthorID": "57193552326", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
