An adequate understanding of the aetiology and pathophysiology of neuro-ophthalmic conditions is fundamental for establishing successful therapeutic strategies. Animal models are therefore considered crucial for understanding and investigating pathological events. Several animal models have been developed for studying neuro-ophthalmic disorders. However, their validity is closely related to the level of similarity with the human pathology. Rodent models are extensively used due to their accessibility and cost efficiency. In particular, mouse models are recognised as among the best genetic models due to the ability to easily alter their genome. Rats are easy to breed and mostly used for toxic/pharmacological and surgical models. Nevertheless, rodent models are still suboptimal for human neuro-ophthalmic conditions because of anatomical differences between species. Primate models have the obvious advantage of sharing vast anatomical and genomic similarities with humans. However, monkeys are expensive, difficult to breed and can only be handled by qualified personnel, all of which limits their suitability. Hence, there is no perfect species for studying neuro-ophthalmic conditions. This chapter will focus on the most common animal models of neuro-ophthalmic conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Ischemic optic neuropathy", "Leber hereditary optic neuropathy", "Multiple sclerosis", "Neuro-ophthalmology", "Parkinson\u2019s disease"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978230996", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"16646771400": {"Name": "Normando E.", "AuthorID": "16646771400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Neurodegeneration Research, Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Francesca Cordeiro M.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016550, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Ophthalmology Research Group (ICORG), Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare Trust"}, "56763623700": {"Name": "Brodie J.", "AuthorID": "56763623700", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Neurodegeneration Research, Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
