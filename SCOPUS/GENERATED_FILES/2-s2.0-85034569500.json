American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.We compare case studies of Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS)-observed magnetopause electron diffusion regions (EDRs) to determine how the rate of work done by the electric field, J.(E+Ve*B) \u2261 J . E\u2032 varies with shear angle. We analyze MMS-observed EDR event with a guide field approximately the same size as the magnetosheath reconnecting field, which occurred on 8 December 2015. We find that J . E\u2032 was largest and positive near the magnetic field reversal point, though patchy lower amplitude J . E\u2032 also occurred on the magnetosphere side EDR near the electron crescent point. The current associated with the large J . E\u2032 near the X point was carried by electrons with a velocity distribution function (VDF) resembling the magnetosheath inflow, shifted in the \u2212v\u2225 direction. At the magnetosphere side EDR, the current was carried by electrons with a crescent-like VDF. We compare this 8 December event to 10 other EDRs with different guide field strengths. The dual-region J . E\u2032 > 0was observed in three other moderate-shear EDR events, whereas three high-shear events had a strong positive J . E\u2032 near the electron crescent point and one low-shear event had a strong positive J . E\u2032 only near the BL=0 point. The dual-region J . E\u2032 was seen for one of three \u201cintermediate\u201d-shear EDRs with guide fields of \u223c0.2\u20130.3. We propose a physical relationship between the shear angle and mode of energy conversion where (a) a guide field provides an efficient mechanism for carrying a current at the field reversal point (streaming) and (b) a guide field may limit the formation of crescent electron VDFs, limiting the current carried near the stagnation point.", "AuthorKeywords": ["magnetic reconnection", "magnetopause", "MMS"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034569500", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"55953868800": {"Name": "Genestreti K.", "AuthorID": "55953868800", "AffiliationID": "60020103, 60003156", "AffiliationName": "Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "56354743700": {"Name": "Varsani A.", "AuthorID": "56354743700", "AffiliationID": "60020103, 60003156", "AffiliationName": "Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "57203071451": {"Name": "Burch J.", "AuthorID": "57203071451", "AffiliationID": "60011533", "AffiliationName": "Space Science and Engineering Division, Southwest Research Institute"}, "6701402789": {"Name": "Torbert R.", "AuthorID": "6701402789", "AffiliationID": "60027576", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Center, University of New Hampshire"}, "36163023200": {"Name": "Allen R.", "AuthorID": "36163023200", "AffiliationID": "60003212", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Texas at San Antonio"}, "6508046129": {"Name": "Cassak P.", "AuthorID": "6508046129", "AffiliationID": "60021143", "AffiliationName": "West Virginia University"}, "7006660827": {"Name": "Ergun R.", "AuthorID": "7006660827", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado Boulder"}, "7102804364": {"Name": "Phan T.", "AuthorID": "7102804364", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Institute, University of California"}, "7006512935": {"Name": "Giles B.", "AuthorID": "7006512935", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "Heliophysics Science Division, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"}, "57202751159": {"Name": "Russell C.", "AuthorID": "57202751159", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "56449759000": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "56449759000", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "University of Maryland"}, "57197760144": {"Name": "Akhavan-Tafti M.", "AuthorID": "57197760144", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering Department, University of Michigan"}}}
