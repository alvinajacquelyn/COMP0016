They lead to contamination at both the field and postharvest stages of food production with a considerable range of foodstuffs affected, from coffee and cereals, to dried fruit and spices. With wide ranging structural diversity of mycotoxins, severe toxic effects caused by these molecules and their high chemical stability the requirement for robust and effective detection methods is clear.This paper builds on our previous review and summarises the most recent advances in this field, in the years 2009-2014 inclusive. This review summarises traditional methods such as chromatographic and immunochemical techniques, as well as newer approaches such as biosensors, and optical techniques which are becoming more prevalent. A section on sampling and sample treatment has been prepared to highlight the importance of this step in the analytical methods. We close with a look at emerging technologies that will bring effective and rapid analysis out of the laboratory and into the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analytical Chemistry", "Cereals", "Methods", "Mycotoxins"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cereals", "Emerging technologies", "Immunochemical techniques", "Methods", "Mycotoxins", "Secondary metabolites", "Small organic molecules", "Structural diversity", "Biosensing Techniques", "Chromatography, Gas", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Mycotoxins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952876604", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"7202573122": {"Name": "Turner N.W.", "AuthorID": "7202573122", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, The Open University"}, "56997518400": {"Name": "Bramhmbhatt H.", "AuthorID": "56997518400", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, The Open University"}, "56997392800": {"Name": "Szabo-Vezse M.", "AuthorID": "56997392800", "AffiliationID": "60112941", "AffiliationName": "Toximet Ltd., ToxiMet Limited"}, "36504922400": {"Name": "Poma A.", "AuthorID": "36504922400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16433821300": {"Name": "Coker R.", "AuthorID": "16433821300", "AffiliationID": "60112941", "AffiliationName": "Toximet Ltd., ToxiMet Limited"}, "7005942776": {"Name": "Piletsky S.A.", "AuthorID": "7005942776", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Leicester"}}}
