Here, we first characterized HBV antigen expression in HCC metastases, occurring in a patient who had undergone liver transplantation for HBV-related HCC. We then deployed for the first time in HCC autologous T cells, genetically modified to express an HBsAg specific T cell receptor, as therapy against chemoresistant extrahepatic metastases. We confirmed that HBV antigens were expressed in HCC metastases (but not in the donor liver) and demonstrated that tumour cells were recognized in vivo by lymphocytes, engineered to express an HBV-specific T cell receptor (TCR). Gene-modified T cells survived, expanded and mediated a reduction in HBsAg levels without exacerbation of liver inflammation or other toxicity. Whilst clinical efficacy was not established in this subject with endstage metastatic disease, we confirm the feasibility of providing autologous TCR-redirected therapy against HCC and advocate this strategy as a novel therapeutic opportunity in hepatitis B-associated malignancies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HBV-specific CD8 T cells", "Liver cancer", "T cell therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Fatal Outcome", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hepatitis B Surface Antigens", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Immunotherapy", "Liver Neoplasms", "Male", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "Tacrolimus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922268964", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "35912174200": {"Name": "Zhan H.", "AuthorID": "35912174200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "35378208900": {"Name": "Brunetto M.", "AuthorID": "35378208900", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "56346977700": {"Name": "Ciccorossi P.", "AuthorID": "56346977700", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "6506898827": {"Name": "Cavallone D.", "AuthorID": "6506898827", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "56588797500": {"Name": "Moriconi F.", "AuthorID": "56588797500", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "57217624814": {"Name": "Mazzoni A.", "AuthorID": "57217624814", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology Unit, University Hospital of Pisa"}, "7004581241": {"Name": "Gehring A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004581241", "AffiliationID": "60113364, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, A/STAR"}, "7004014799": {"Name": "Bertoletti A.", "AuthorID": "7004014799", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Immunity and Infection, College of Medical and Dental Science, University of Birmingham"}, "7202789859": {"Name": "Xue S.A.", "AuthorID": "7202789859", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "12771712800": {"Name": "Schurich A.", "AuthorID": "12771712800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "8747891100": {"Name": "Morris E.", "AuthorID": "8747891100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "7003333032": {"Name": "Maini M.K.", "AuthorID": "7003333032", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "57202567329": {"Name": "Stauss H.", "AuthorID": "57202567329", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "26421239300": {"Name": "Khakpoor A.", "AuthorID": "26421239300", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Program Emerging Infectious Diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School"}, "56503984600": {"Name": "Farzhenah F.", "AuthorID": "56503984600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Cell Therapy Suite, Kings College, London"}, "55913345400": {"Name": "Chan L.", "AuthorID": "55913345400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Cell Therapy Suite, Kings College, London"}, "55402038400": {"Name": "Bonino F.", "AuthorID": "55402038400", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "General Medicine, Liver and Digestive Disease Unit, University Hospital of Pisa"}}}
