Of two reduced-size powder material types tested, powders with particle sizes \u2264 40 \u03bcm offered better chances of recovering ridge detail from unpolished ivory in comparison to a conventional powder material. The quality of developed ridge detail of these powders was also assessed for comparison and automated search suitability. Powder materials and the enhanced ridge detail on ivory were analysed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and interactions between their constituents and the ivory discussed. The effect of ageing on the quality of ridge detail recovered showed that the best quality was obtained within 1 week. However, some ridge detail could still be developed up to 28 days after deposition. Cyanoacrylate and fluorescently-labelled cyanoacrylate fuming of ridge detail on ivory was explored and was less effective than reduced-scale powdering in general. This research contributes to the understanding and potential application of smaller scale powdering materials for the development of ridge detail on hard, semi-porous biological material typically seized in wildlife-related crimes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fingermark enhancement", "Forensic science", "Latent fingerprints", "Wildlife"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Crime", "Dermatoglyphics", "Elephants", "Humans", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Particle Size", "Powders", "Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission", "Tooth"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960922399", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"57170724500": {"Name": "Weston-Ford K.", "AuthorID": "57170724500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Environmental Sciences Division, King's College London"}, "12753795900": {"Name": "Barron L.", "AuthorID": "12753795900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Environmental Sciences Division, King's College London"}, "57169793600": {"Name": "Moseley M.", "AuthorID": "57169793600", "AffiliationID": "60113295", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Forensic Services, Evidence Recovery Unit, Metropolitan Police Service"}, "7402375324": {"Name": "Hall L.", "AuthorID": "7402375324", "AffiliationID": "60113295", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Forensic Services, Evidence Recovery Unit, Metropolitan Police Service"}, "55042590300": {"Name": "Marsh N.", "AuthorID": "55042590300", "AffiliationID": "60113295", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Forensic Services, Evidence Recovery Unit, Metropolitan Police Service"}, "57194780985": {"Name": "Morgan R.", "AuthorID": "57194780985", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for the Forensic Sciences"}}}
