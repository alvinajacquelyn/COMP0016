KGaA, WeinheimCopper-based ternary bimetal chalcogenides have very promising potential as multifunctional theragnosis nanoplatform for photothermal treatment of tumors. However, the design and synthesis of such an effective platform remains challenging. In this study, hydrophilic CuCo2S4 nanocrystals (NCs) with a desirable size of \u224810 nm are synthesized by a simple one-pot hydrothermal route. The as-prepared ultrasmall CuCo2S4 NCs show: 1) intense near-infrared absorption, which is attributed to 3d electronic transitions from the valence band to an intermediate band, as identified by density functional theory calculations; 2) high photothermal performance with a photothermal conversion efficiency up to 73.4%; and 3) capability for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, as a result of the unpaired 3d electrons of cobalt. Finally, it is demonstrated that the CuCo2S4 NCs are a promising \u201call-in-one\u201d photothermal theragnosis nanoplatform for photothermal cancer therapy under the irradiation of a 915 nm laser at a safe power density of 0.5 W cm\u22122, guided by MR and infrared thermal imaging. This work further promotes the potential applications of ternary bimetal chalcogenides for photothermal theragnosis therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CuCo2S4 nanocrystals", "DFT calculations", "photothermal therapy", "ternary bimetal chalcogenides", "ultrasmall magnetic resonance imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["DFT calculation", "Electronic transition", "Infrared thermal imaging", "Near-infrared absorption", "Photothermal cancer therapy", "Photothermal conversion efficiencies", "Photothermal therapy", "Ultra-small"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009961376", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57089312600": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "57089312600", "AffiliationID": "60020044, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56120346600": {"Name": "Yuan F.", "AuthorID": "56120346600", "AffiliationID": "60121960", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Xuzhou Central Hospital"}, "57192721409": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57192721409", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "55276472800": {"Name": "Qin J.", "AuthorID": "55276472800", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "8839201800": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "8839201800", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60073647", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine"}, "8297915700": {"Name": "Wu C.", "AuthorID": "8297915700", "AffiliationID": "60020044, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Ceramics and Superfine Microstructure, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56328578400": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "56328578400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.X.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57212409832": {"Name": "Wang Q.", "AuthorID": "57212409832", "AffiliationID": "60025084, 60031584", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Shanghai First People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University"}}}
