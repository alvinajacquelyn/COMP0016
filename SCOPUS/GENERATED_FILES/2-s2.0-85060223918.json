This review covers research on how people with intellectual disabilities view their ascribed label; to what extent they ascribe it to themselves; and whether they recognize it as devalued in society. Method: Rapid review methodology using PsycINFO, citation- and hand-searching identified relevant studies. Results: The 16 studies identified indicate that the majority are aware of their ascribed label, or acknowledge they are \u201cdifferent\u201d. Others reject it, focusing on alternative attributes or roles. Most recognize others view the label negatively and express feelings of shame, anger and powerlessness. Conclusions: The review advances our understanding of social identity formation in people with intellectual disabilities, with implications for future research and practice to support construction of positive social identities and stigma resistance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["identity", "intellectual disabilities", "label", "review", "stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Social Identification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060223918", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57204647743": {"Name": "Logeswaran S.", "AuthorID": "57204647743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57205483743": {"Name": "Hollett M.", "AuthorID": "57205483743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57205488103": {"Name": "Zala S.", "AuthorID": "57205488103", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57206419621": {"Name": "Richardson L.", "AuthorID": "57206419621", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6507888355": {"Name": "Scior K.", "AuthorID": "6507888355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
