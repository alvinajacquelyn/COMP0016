Taking a developmental approach to this issue allows us to assess whether perceptual processing develops in close association with the emergence of related action skills within the same individual. The current study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate the perception of human action in 4-to 6-month-old human infants. In addition, the infants' manual dexterity was assessed using the fine motor component of The Mullen Scales of Early Learning and an in-house developed Manual Dexterity task. Results show that the degree of cortical activation, within the posterior superior temporal sulcus-temporoparietal junction (pSTS-TPJ) region, to the perception of manual actions in individual infants correlates with their own level of fine motor skills. This association was not fully explained by either measures of global attention (i.e., looking time) or general developmental stage. This striking concordance between the emergence of motor skills and related perceptual processing within individuals is consistent with experience-related cortical specialization in the developing brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["action", "fNIRS", "infancy", "IPL", "pSTS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child Development", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Motion Perception", "Motor Skills", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924968522", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"25230332300": {"Name": "Lloyd-Fox S.", "AuthorID": "25230332300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36072829800": {"Name": "Johnson M.H.", "AuthorID": "36072829800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36085429100": {"Name": "Wu R.", "AuthorID": "36085429100", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, University of Rochester"}, "7403707224": {"Name": "Richards J.E.", "AuthorID": "7403707224", "AffiliationID": "60018179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of South Carolina"}, "7004171877": {"Name": "Elwell C.E.", "AuthorID": "7004171877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}}}
