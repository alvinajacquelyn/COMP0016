All rights reserved.Harnessing the optical properties of noble metals down to the nanometre scale is a key step towards fast and low-dissipative information processing. At the 10-nm length scale, metal crystallinity and patterning as well as probing of surface plasmon properties must be controlled with a challenging high level of precision. Here, we demonstrate that ultimate lateral confinement and delocalization of surface plasmon modes are simultaneously achieved in extended self-assembled networks comprising linear chains of partially fused gold nanoparticles. The spectral and spatial distributions of the surface plasmon modes associated with the colloidal superstructures are evidenced by performing monochromated electron energy-loss spectroscopy with a nanometre-sized electron probe. We prepare the metallic bead strings by electron-beam-induced interparticle fusion of nanoparticle networks. The fused superstructures retain the native morphology and crystallinity but develop very low-energy surface plasmon modes that are capable of supporting long-range and spectrally tunable propagation in nanoscale waveguides.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Colloidal networks", "Lateral confinement", "Low energy surfaces", "Nano-scale waveguides", "Nanoparticle networks", "Self-assembled networks", "Spectrally tunable", "Surface plasmon modes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930962386", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55360852200": {"Name": "Teulle A.", "AuthorID": "55360852200", "AffiliationID": "60024174", "AffiliationName": "CEMES CNRS UPR 8011"}, "7202447549": {"Name": "Girard C.", "AuthorID": "7202447549", "AffiliationID": "60024174", "AffiliationName": "CEMES CNRS UPR 8011"}, "57196220575": {"Name": "Gurunatha K.", "AuthorID": "57196220575", "AffiliationID": "60024174", "AffiliationName": "CEMES CNRS UPR 8011"}, "7003528158": {"Name": "Dujardin E.", "AuthorID": "7003528158", "AffiliationID": "60024174", "AffiliationName": "CEMES CNRS UPR 8011"}, "7007004212": {"Name": "Bosman M.", "AuthorID": "7007004212", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A STAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "7405266896": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "7405266896", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Organized Matter Chemistry, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "7401546743": {"Name": "Mann S.", "AuthorID": "7401546743", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Organized Matter Chemistry, School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}}}
