All rights reserved.Cell-based screening assays are frequently used in drug discovery and academic research to identify cellular phenotypes in response to a genetic or chemical perturbation. When investigating cell biology processes, the use of high-content imaging facilitates the analysis of a large number of samples within a reasonably short time frame and at moderate costs. Here, we will provide an overview of the high-content screening process, from experimental design to available platform technologies and bioinformatics analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell biology", "Cytometry", "High-content analysis", "High-content screening", "Image analysis", "ImageJ", "Organelle", "R-project"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013241607", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6603482374": {"Name": "Ketteler R.", "AuthorID": "6603482374", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "27567808900": {"Name": "Kriston-Vizi J.", "AuthorID": "27567808900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
