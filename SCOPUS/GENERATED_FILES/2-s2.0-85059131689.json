In doing so, he also hypothesized a cognitive constraint: that it is too difficult for planners to conceive the kind of complexity found in traditional urban structures in a single mental act. To explore the relationship between complex design, creative challenge and cognitive constraint, this chapter reports on student design exercises using Alexander\u2019s Pattern Language as a generator of urban form. The study provides insights into the creative challenge faced by students using patterns in their designs, and helps shed light on the cognitive aspect of design using patterns; and hence draws conclusions about the implications of using patterns for creating complex designs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central Business District", "Complex Design", "Pattern Language", "Urban Design", "Urban Form"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059131689", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"7401823365": {"Name": "Marshall S.", "AuthorID": "7401823365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
