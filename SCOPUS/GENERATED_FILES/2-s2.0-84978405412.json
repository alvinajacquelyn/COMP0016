A key task in this context is to identify risk factors associated with these events, providing potential targets for mitigating policies. For this, we employ a discrete time competing risks survival model, dealing simultaneously with university outcomes and its associated temporal component. We define survival times as the duration of the student's enrolment at university and possible outcomes as graduation or two types of dropout (voluntary and involuntary), exploring the information recorded at admission time (e.g. educational level of the parents) as potential predictors. Although similar strategies have been previously implemented, we extend the previous methods by handling covariate selection within a Bayesian variable selection framework, where model uncertainty is formally addressed through Bayesian model averaging. Our methodology is general; however, here we focus on undergraduate students enrolled in three selected degree programmes of the Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile during the period 2000\u20132011. Our analysis reveals interesting insights, highlighting the main covariates that influence students\u2019 risk of dropout and delayed graduation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian model averaging", "Competing risks", "Delayed graduation", "Proportional odds model", "University dropout"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978405412", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"57038529000": {"Name": "Vallejos C.", "AuthorID": "57038529000", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}, "7102197241": {"Name": "Steel M.", "AuthorID": "7102197241", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}}}
