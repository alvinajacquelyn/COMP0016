PARP inhibitors are being evaluated in late-stage clinical trials of ovarian cancer (OC). Recently, olaparib was the first PARP inhibitor approved in the European Union and United States for the treatment of advanced BRCA-mutated OC. This paper reviews the role of BRCA mutations for tumorigenesis and PARP inhibitor sensitivity, and summarises the clinical development of PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients diagnosed with OC. Among the five key PARP inhibitors currently in clinical development, olaparib has undergone the most extensive clinical investigation. PARP inhibitors have demonstrated durable antitumour activity in BRCA-mutated advanced OC as a single agent in the treatment and maintenance setting, particularly in platinum-sensitive disease. PARP inhibitors are well tolerated; however, further careful assessment of moderate and late-onset toxicity is mandatory in the maintenance and adjuvant setting, respectively. PARP inhibitors are also being evaluated in combination with chemotherapeutic and novel targeted agents to potentiate antitumour activities. Current research is extending the use of PARP inhibitors beyond BRCA mutations to other sensitising molecular defects that result in HR-deficient cancer, and is defining an HR-deficiency signature. Trials are underway to determine whether such a signature will predict sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in women with sporadic OC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BRCA mutation", "cytotoxic therapy", "homologous recombination", "ovarian cancer", "PARP inhibitor", "synthetic lethality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "BRCA1 Protein", "BRCA2 Protein", "Female", "Humans", "Mutation", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991037085", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7004782584": {"Name": "Konecny G.E.", "AuthorID": "7004782584", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles"}, "8771515300": {"Name": "Kristeleit R.S.", "AuthorID": "8771515300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London, Paul Gorman Building"}}}
