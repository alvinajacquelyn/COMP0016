To achieve this, we propose a low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) precoding based on an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm to minimize multiuser interference (MUI) in massive multiuser MIMO systems. The proposed approach exhibits fast convergence and low complexity characteristics. Compared with a conventional constant-envelope precoding and an annulus-constrained precoding, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AMP precoding is superior both in terms of computational complexity and average running time. In addition, the proposed AMP precoding exhibits a much desirable tradeoff between MUI suppression and PAPR reduction. These findings indicate that the proposed AMP precoding is a suitable candidate for hardware implementation, which is very appealing for massive MIMO systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)", "message passing", "peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Average running time", "Complexity characteristics", "Hardware implementations", "Low-complexity precoding", "Multi-user interference", "Multi-user MIMO systems", "Multiuser multiple-input multiple-output systems", "Peak to average power ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979523713", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"24444199100": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "24444199100", "AffiliationID": "60033110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University"}, "57188985036": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "57188985036", "AffiliationID": "60011357", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University"}, "7201367144": {"Name": "Wen C.", "AuthorID": "7201367144", "AffiliationID": "60011357", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
