Published by Taylor & Francis.The systematic application of rigorous evidence to inform the design and implementation of development policies and programmes has the potential to positively influence development outcomes. To achieve such evidence-informed development, a process of generating, transmitting, and using high-quality, policy-relevant evidence of development effectiveness is required. This article focuses on the final step in this casual chain \u2013 the use of evidence by national development policymakers. It proposes a people- and demand-focused approach to capacity building for the use of research evidence by policymakers. This support in building personal as well as team capacity and demand is assumed to encourage a growing institutionalisation of evidence use. The article integrates these capacity-building efforts into the wider theory of change for evidence-informed development, highlighting the importance of effective mechanisms to encourage research use in order to achieve the objective of improving lives through research evidence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["capacity building", "development effectiveness", "evidence use", "evidence-informed development", "theory of change"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952298448", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"56007758000": {"Name": "Langer L.", "AuthorID": "56007758000", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Anthropological Research, University of Johannesburg"}, "8604870700": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "8604870700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "EPPI-Centre, Social Science Research Unit, Institute of Education, University of London"}, "26321461600": {"Name": "Erasmus Y.", "AuthorID": "26321461600", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Anthropological Research, University of Johannesburg"}, "6602822130": {"Name": "de Wet T.", "AuthorID": "6602822130", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Anthropological Research, University of Johannesburg"}}}
