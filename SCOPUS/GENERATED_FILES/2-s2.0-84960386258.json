The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test contains peptide 38-55 of Rv2654c, based on data indicating differential recognition between tuberculosis patients and BCG vaccinated controls in Europe. We aimed to fine map the T cell response to Rv2654c with the view of improving sensitivity. Methods: Interferon-gamma ELISpot assay was used in HIV uninfected persons with latent and active tuberculosis to map peptide epitopes of Rv2654c. A modified IGRA was tested in two further groups of 55 HIV uninfected and 44 HIV infected persons, recruited in South Africa. Results: The most prominently recognised peptide was between amino acids 51-65. Using p51-65 to boost the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube assay, the quantitative performance of the modified IGRA increased from 1.83 IU/ml (IQR 0.30-7.35) to 2.83 (IQR 0.28-12.2; p = 0.002) in the HIV uninfected group. In the HIV infected cohort the percentage of positive responders increased from 57% to 64% but only after 3 months of ART (p = ns). Conclusions: Our data shows the potential to population tailor detection of MTB sensitization using specific synthetic peptides and interferon-gamma release in vitro.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV", "Interferon-Gamma Release Assays (IGRA)", "Peptide epitope", "QuantiFERON assay", "Rv2654c", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay", "Epitope Mapping", "Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte", "Europe", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Interferon-gamma Release Tests", "Male", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "South Africa", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960386258", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"23993784600": {"Name": "Horvati K.", "AuthorID": "23993784600", "AffiliationID": "60108407, 60025187", "AffiliationName": "MTA-ELTE Research Group of Peptide Chemistry, E\u00f6tv\u00f6s L.
