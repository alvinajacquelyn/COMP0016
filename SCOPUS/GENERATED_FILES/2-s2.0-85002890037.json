They were checked using large experimental data sets for eclogitic (\u223c530) and peridotitic systems (>650). The precision of the universal Cpx barometer for peridotites based on Jd-Di exchange is close to Cr-Tschermakite method produced by Nimis and Taylor (2000). Cpx barometer was transformed by the substitution of major multiplier for KD by the equations dependent from Al-Na-Fe. Obtained equation in combination with the thermometer of Nimis and Taylor (2000) allow to reconstruct position of the magma feeder systems of the alkali basaltic magma within the mantle diapirs in modern platforms like in Vitim plateau and other Southern Siberia localities and several localities worldwide showing good agreement of pressure ranges for black and green suites. These equations allow construct PTX diagrams for the kimberlite localities in Siberia and worldwide calculating simultaneously the PT parameters for different groups of mantle rocks. They give very good results for the concentrates from kimberlite lamproites and placers with mantle minerals. They are useful for PT estimates for diamond inclusions. The positions of eclogite groups in mantle sections are similar to those determined with new Gar\u2013Cpx barometer produced by C. Beyer et al. (2015). The Fe rich eclogites commonly trace the boundary between the lower upper parts of subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM) at 3\u20134 GPa marking pyroxenite eclogites layer. Ca-rich eclogites and especially grospydites in SCLM beneath Precambrian kimberlites occurs near pyroxenite layer but in younger mantle sections they became common in the lower parts. The diamondiferous Mg Cr-less group eclogites referring to the ancient island arc complexes are also common in the middle part of mantle sections and near 5\u20136 GPa. Commonly eclogites in lower apart of mantle sections are remelted and trace the high temperature convective branch. The Mg- and Fe-rich pyroxenites also show the extending in pressure trends which suggest the anatexic melting under the influence of volatiles or under the interaction with plums.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barometer", "Clinopyroxene", "Eclogite", "Garnet", "Kimberlite", "Peridotite"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002890037", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"6603845588": {"Name": "Ashchepkov I.", "AuthorID": "6603845588", "AffiliationID": "60073372, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "V.S.
