Methods A total of 70 patients with chronic hepatitis C who had previously failed antiviral therapy were randomized to receive pegylated interferon with or without silymarin for 24 months. Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) tests (hyularonic acid, terminal peptide of procollagen III, tissue inhibitor of matrix metaloproteinase-1) were performed on patient sera obtained before, during and at the end of the study (0, 12, 24 months) and liver histology obtained before and at the end of the study. Results At 24 months, absolute changes in Ishak fibrosis stage and ELF ranged from -4 to +4 and from -2.41 to +2.68, respectively. Absolute changes in ELF at 12 months were significantly associated with changes in both ELF and histology at 24 months. A model combining both baseline ELF and change of ELF at 12 months could predict the 24-month ELF (R 2 =0.609, P<1\u00d710-11), a decrease in ELF at 24 months [area under the curve (AUC): 0.80-0.85] and an increase in ELF at 24 months (AUC: 0.81-0.85). Furthermore, a model combining both baseline histologic stage and ELF together with the change of ELF at 12 months could predict 24-month histology (R 2 =0.601, P<1\u00d710-11, AUC: 0.88-0.92), histologic fibrosis regression (AUC: 0.81-0.84) and progression (AUC: 0.86-0.91). Conclusion Our observations suggest that a change in the serum marker ELF predicts changes in liver fibrosis over a longer period. These data support the use of ELF as a surrogate marker of liver fibrosis evolution in monitoring antifibrotic treatments, thus permitting 'response-guided' therapy by the early identification of patients who will benefit from prolonged treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "chronic hepatitis C", "fibrosis", "histology", "interferon", "longitudinal", "silymarin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antiviral Agents", "Area Under Curve", "Austria", "Biomarkers", "Biopsy", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Genotype", "Germany", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Hyaluronic Acid", "Interferon-alpha", "Liver", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Procollagen", "Prospective Studies", "Recombinant Proteins", "RNA, Viral", "ROC Curve", "Silymarin", "Time Factors", "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1", "Treatment Outcome", "Viral Load", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001090641", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"35742135900": {"Name": "Tanwar S.", "AuthorID": "35742135900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "36958775100": {"Name": "Trembling P.M.", "AuthorID": "36958775100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57220522743": {"Name": "Hogan B.J.", "AuthorID": "57220522743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57014022200": {"Name": "Srivastava A.", "AuthorID": "57014022200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "35374746300": {"Name": "Rosenberg W.M.", "AuthorID": "35374746300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "8215533200": {"Name": "Grant P.", "AuthorID": "8215533200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology and Virology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16310245000": {"Name": "Nastouli E.", "AuthorID": "16310245000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology and Virology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57001188500": {"Name": "Parkes J.", "AuthorID": "57001188500", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences and Medical Statistics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57199122432": {"Name": "Harris S.", "AuthorID": "57199122432", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences and Medical Statistics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "6602646310": {"Name": "Ocker M.", "AuthorID": "6602646310", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine 1, University of Erlangen"}, "57190071153": {"Name": "Wehr K.", "AuthorID": "57190071153", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine 1, University of Erlangen"}, "7102091240": {"Name": "Herold C.", "AuthorID": "7102091240", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine 1, University of Erlangen"}, "35448732000": {"Name": "Schuppan D.", "AuthorID": "35448732000", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60030058", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School"}, "6701548369": {"Name": "Neureiter D.", "AuthorID": "6701548369", "AffiliationID": "60014976, 60008189", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pathology, Paracelsus Medical University/Salzburger Landeskliniken (SALK)"}}}
