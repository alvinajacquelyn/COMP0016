The generators of such evolutions are called Lindbladians. In the setting of quantum many-body systems on a lattice it is natural to consider Lindbladians that decompose into a sum of local interactions with decreasing strength with respect to the size of their support. For both practical and theoretical reasons, it is crucial to estimate the impact that perturbations in the generating Lindbladian, arising as noise or errors, can have on the evolution. These local perturbations are potentially unbounded, but constrained to respect the underlying lattice structure. We show that even for polynomially decaying errors in the Lindbladian, local observables and correlation functions are stable if the unperturbed Lindbladian has a unique fixed point and a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. The proof relies on Lieb\u2013Robinson bounds, which describe a finite group velocity for propagation of information in local systems. As a main example, we prove that classical Glauber dynamics is stable under local perturbations, including perturbations in the transition rates, which may not preserve detailed balance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937760127", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"]], "AuthorData": {"23768101300": {"Name": "Cubitt T.S.", "AuthorID": "23768101300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "DAMTP, University of Cambridge"}, "56585498300": {"Name": "Lucia A.", "AuthorID": "56585498300", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Dpto. de An\u00e1lisis Matem\u00e1tico, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "55909359400": {"Name": "Perez-Garcia D.", "AuthorID": "55909359400", "AffiliationID": "60027282", "AffiliationName": "Dpto. de An\u00e1lisis Matem\u00e1tico, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "55945428700": {"Name": "Michalakis S.", "AuthorID": "55945428700", "AffiliationID": "60011911, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Quantum Information and Matter, Caltech"}}}
