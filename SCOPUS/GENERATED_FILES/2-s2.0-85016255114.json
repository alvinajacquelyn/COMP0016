In the presence of substoichiometric quantities of ligands, namely, stearic or di(octyl)phosphinic acid (0.1-0.2 equiv vs Cu), ultrasmall nanoparticles are prepared with diameters as low as \u223c2 nm, soluble in a range of solvents. The solutions of Cu NPs undergo quantitative oxidation, on exposure to air, to form Cu2O NPs. The Cu2O NPs can be reduced back to Cu(0) NPs using accessible temperatures and low pressures of hydrogen (135 \u00b0C, 3 bar H2). This striking reversible redox cycling of the discrete, solubilized Cu/Cu(I) colloids was successfully repeated over 10 cycles, representing 19 separate reactions. The ligands influence the evolution of both composition and size of the nanoparticles, during synthesis and redox cycling, as explored in detail using vacuum-transfer aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and visible spectroscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["copper nanoparticles", "copper(I) oxide nanoparticles", "organo-copper(I)", "redox switching", "transmission electron microscopy", "ultrasmall nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Copper nanoparticles", "organo-copper(I)", "Oxide nanoparticles", "Redox switching", "Ultra-small"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016255114", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"54785201100": {"Name": "Pike S.D.", "AuthorID": "54785201100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56625502800": {"Name": "White E.R.", "AuthorID": "56625502800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "57193750529": {"Name": "Sammy N.", "AuthorID": "57193750529", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.S.P.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "54882406000": {"Name": "Regoutz A.", "AuthorID": "54882406000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "56785104500": {"Name": "Payne D.J.", "AuthorID": "56785104500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "55476614900": {"Name": "Williams C.K.", "AuthorID": "55476614900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Oxford University, Chemistry Research Laboratory"}}}
