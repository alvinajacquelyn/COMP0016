A large number of fields and subjects, ranging from everyday life to traditional research fields (i.e., geography and transportation, biology and chemistry, medicine and rehabilitation), involve big data problems. The popularizing of various types of network has diversified types, issues, and solutions for big data more than ever before. In this paper, we review recent research in data types, storage models, privacy, data security, analysis methods, and applications related to network big data. Finally, we summarize the challenges and development of big data to predict current and future trends.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big data", "massive data", "network"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis method", "Data analytics", "Massive data", "Recent researches", "Research fields", "Research topics", "State of the art", "Storage model"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019731149", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics Group, University College London"}, "57199094588": {"Name": "Song H.", "AuthorID": "57199094588", "AffiliationID": "60021143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Virginia University"}, "13808004900": {"Name": "Basanta-Val P.", "AuthorID": "13808004900", "AffiliationID": "60001741", "AffiliationName": "Telematics Engineering Department, Universidad Carlos III de Madrid"}, "18435050200": {"Name": "Steed A.", "AuthorID": "18435050200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "23479890500": {"Name": "Jo M.", "AuthorID": "23479890500", "AffiliationID": "60005273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Convergence Software, Korea University"}}}
