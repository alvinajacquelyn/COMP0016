Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.In this article, we introduce recently released, publicly available resources, which allow users to watch videos of hidden articulators (e.g. the tongue) during the production of various types of sounds found in the world\u2019s languages. The articulation videos on these resources are linked to a clickable International Phonetic Alphabet chart ([International Phonetic Association. 1999. Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A Guide to the Use of the International Phonetic Alphabet. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press]), so that the user can study the articulations of different types of speech sounds systematically. We discuss the utility of these resources for teaching the pronunciation of contrastive sounds in a foreign language that are absent in the learner\u2019s native language.", "AuthorKeywords": ["articulation video", "foreign language", "IPA", "MRI", "Pronunciation", "ultrasound"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962843847", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"7201877479": {"Name": "Nakai S.", "AuthorID": "7201877479", "AffiliationID": "60101496", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language (CASL) Research Centre, Queen Margaret University"}, "37097484900": {"Name": "Lawson E.", "AuthorID": "37097484900", "AffiliationID": "60101496", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language (CASL) Research Centre, Queen Margaret University"}, "6507182184": {"Name": "Scobbie J.", "AuthorID": "6507182184", "AffiliationID": "60101496", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language (CASL) Research Centre, Queen Margaret University"}, "57188750200": {"Name": "Beavan D.", "AuthorID": "57188750200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Digital Humanities (UCLDH), Faculty of Arts and Humanities, University College London"}, "22334140600": {"Name": "Lepl\u00e2tre G.", "AuthorID": "22334140600", "AffiliationID": "60018186", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, Edinburgh Napier University"}, "7801491004": {"Name": "Stuart-Smith J.", "AuthorID": "7801491004", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "English Language, University of Glasgow"}}}
