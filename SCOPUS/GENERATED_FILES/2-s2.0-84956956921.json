An equivalent discrete form of the conjecture is that the number of homomorphisms from a bipartite graph H to a graph G is asymptotically at least the expected number of homomorphisms from H to the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph with the same expected edge density as G. In this paper, we present two approaches to the conjecture. First, we introduce the notion of tree-arrangeability, where a bipartite graph H with bipartition A \u222a B is tree-arrangeable if neighborhoods of vertices in A have a certain tree-like structure. We show that Sidorenko\u2019s conjecture holds for all tree-arrangeable bipartite graphs. In particular, this implies that Sidorenko\u2019s conjecture holds if there are two vertices a1, a2 in A such that each vertex a \u2208 A satisfies N(a) \u2286 N(a1) or N(a) \u2286 N(a2), and also implies a recent result of Conlon, Fox, and Sudakov (2010). Second, if T is a tree and H is a bipartite graph satisfying Sidorenko\u2019s conjecture, then it is shown that the Cartesian product T \u25a1 H of T and H also satisfies Sidorenko\u2019s conjecture. This result implies that, for all d \u2265 2, the d-dimensional grid with arbitrary side lengths satisfies Sidorenko\u2019s conjecture.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956956921", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56812885500": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "56812885500", "AffiliationID": "60009851", "AffiliationName": "School of Computational Sciences, Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS)"}, "35196143100": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "35196143100", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57093209000": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "57093209000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}}}
