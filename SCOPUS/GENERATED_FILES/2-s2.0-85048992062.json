Recruitment of progenitor cells is a key step in the regenerative process. The possibility of repairing missing or diseased tissues in humans has been potentiated by the increasing understanding of somatic stem cells, their plasticity and the possibility of modulating it, that could be harnessed either to stimulate endogenous repair or to engineer the required tissue. Here, we focus on human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), important players in tissue homeostasis in healthy organisms, with a particular emphasis on those derived from the adipose tissue (ADSCs). While a mark of MSC identity is the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes and adipocytes, there is evidence that their potential goes beyond these three mesenchymal lineages. We discuss some differentiation and modulatory properties of MSCs and provide an overview of our recent work on ADSCs from paediatric patients (pADSCs) that has shown their ability to give raise to non-mesenchymal cells, consistent with a significant plasticity. Finally, we present novel data indicating that both mesenchymal lineages (adipogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic) and neural and epithelial lineages can originate from clonal lines that like the parental line express markers of pluripotency as well as the stromal cell marker, GREM1. Together these data support the existence of pADSC multipotent stem cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adipose tissue-derived stem cell (ADSC)", "Human", "Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)", "Plasticity", "Regeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adipocytes", "Adipose Tissue", "Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Polarity", "Chondrocytes", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stem Cells", "Osteoblasts", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048992062", "SubjectAreas": [["Embryology", "MEDI", "2710"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57202676747": {"Name": "Guasti L.", "AuthorID": "57202676747", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56682129800": {"Name": "Hadjidemetriou I.", "AuthorID": "56682129800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57197671640": {"Name": "New S.E.", "AuthorID": "57197671640", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57202640593": {"Name": "Palmiero M.", "AuthorID": "57202640593", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57220386665": {"Name": "Ferretti P.", "AuthorID": "57220386665", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
