All rights reservedPurposeTo determine the long-term outcomes of same-site revision of failed filtering blebs with mitomycin C application.Patients and methodsNoncomparative retrospective case series of 45 eyes of 39 patients. Main outcome measures were surgical success (\u226421, \u226418, and \u226416 mm Hg reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP)). Other outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (VA), visual field loss, number of glaucoma medications, need for further interventions, time from surgery to recommencement of medications or interventions, and complications.ResultsMean follow-up was 126\u00b159.6 months (range 16-227 months). The overall success proportion at last follow-up was 96% for IOP \u226421 mm Hg (criterion 1), 91% for IOP \u226418 mm Hg (criterion 2), and 84% for IOP \u226416 mm Hg (criterion 3). Absolute success at last follow-up was 64%, 38%, and 33% for criteria 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Mean baseline IOP was reduced from 24.2\u00b15.5 to 12.4\u00b15.5 mm Hg at last follow-up. Ten eyes (22%) had early and 3 (7%) eyes had late complications. None of these complications resulted in visual loss or surgery failure. Nine eyes (20%) required further glaucoma surgery. Nine eyes (20%) required further glaucoma laser.ConclusionsSame-site, augmented, bleb revision is a safe and effective technique to control IOP and prevent further visual loss in patients with failed trabeculectomies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alkylating Agents", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitomycin", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Trabeculectomy", "Treatment Failure", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Fields", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041819178", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"35307699100": {"Name": "Nikita E.", "AuthorID": "35307699100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204296793": {"Name": "Murdoch I.", "AuthorID": "57204296793", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
