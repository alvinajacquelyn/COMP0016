The histone variant macroH2A1 under alternative splicing gives rise to macroH2A1. 1 and macroH2A1.2. In this study, we show that the macroH2A1 isoforms play an important role in the regulation of lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Hepatoma cell line and immortalized human hepatocytes transiently transfected or knocked down with macroH2A1 isoforms were used as in vitro model of fat-induced steatosis. Gene expressions were analyzed by quantitative PCR array and Western blot Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis was performed to check the association of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) with the promoter of lipogenic genes. Livers from knockout mice that are resistant to lipid deposition despite a high-fat diet were used for histopathology. We found that macroH2A1.2 is regulated by fat uptake and that its overexpression caused an increase in lipid uptake, triglycerides, and lipogenic genes compared with macroH2A1.1. This suggests that macroH2A1.2 is important for lipid uptake, whereas macroH2A1.1 was found to be protective. The result was supported by a high positivity for macroH2A1.1 in knockout mice for genes targeted by macroH2A1 (Atp5a1 and Fam73b), that under a high-fat diet presented minimal lipidosis. Moreover, macroH2A1 isoforms differentially regulate the expression of lipogenic genes by modulating the association of the active (H3K4me3) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks on their promoters. This study underlines the importance of the replacement of noncanonical histones in the regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism in the progression of steatosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bivalent promoter", "Histone methylation", "Histone variants", "Lipid uptake"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Markers", "Blotting, Western", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Cells, Cultured", "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation", "Diet, High-Fat", "Epigenomics", "Fatty Liver", "Female", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Hepatocytes", "Histones", "Humans", "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "Lipid Peroxidation", "Liver", "Liver Neoplasms", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Isoforms", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932610910", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"54974336800": {"Name": "Podrini C.", "AuthorID": "54974336800", "AffiliationID": "60112926", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Liver Research, Institute of Hepatology, Epigenetics of Fatty Liver Disease Research Group"}, "56698410700": {"Name": "Koffas A.", "AuthorID": "56698410700", "AffiliationID": "60112926", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Liver Research, Institute of Hepatology, Epigenetics of Fatty Liver Disease Research Group"}, "56698328800": {"Name": "Choksh S.", "AuthorID": "56698328800", "AffiliationID": "60112926", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Liver Research, Institute of Hepatology, Epigenetics of Fatty Liver Disease Research Group"}, "7409607221": {"Name": "Williams R.", "AuthorID": "7409607221", "AffiliationID": "60112926", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Liver Research, Institute of Hepatology, Epigenetics of Fatty Liver Disease Research Group"}, "8855338400": {"Name": "Greco A.", "AuthorID": "8855338400", "AffiliationID": "60112926", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Liver Research, Institute of Hepatology, Epigenetics of Fatty Liver Disease Research Group"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, UCL Medical School"}, "57214768589": {"Name": "Lelliott C.", "AuthorID": "57214768589", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Mouse Genetics Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "57202519035": {"Name": "White J.", "AuthorID": "57202519035", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Mouse Genetics Project, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}, "8242612800": {"Name": "Adissu H.", "AuthorID": "8242612800", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Physiology and Experimental Medicine Research Program, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}}}
