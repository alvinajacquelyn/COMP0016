Circumferential fixation allows a stable short-segment construct, but the associated morbidity and complications are high. Posterior short-segment fixation spanning one level above and below the fractured vertebra has led to clinical failures. Augmentation of this method by including the fractured level in the posterior instrumentation has given promising clinical results. The purpose of this study is to compare the biomechanical stability of short-segment posterior fixation including the fractured level (SSPI) to circumferential fixation in thoracolumbar burst fractures. METHODS: An unstable burst fracture was created in 10 fresh-frozen bovine thoracolumbar spine specimens, which were grouped into a Group A and a Group B. Group A specimens were instrumented with SSPI and Group B with circumferential fixation. Biomechanical characteristics including range of motion (ROM) and load-displacement curves were recorded for the intact and instrumented specimens using Universal Testing Device and stereophotogrammetry. RESULTS: In Group A, ROM in flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and axial rotation was reduced by 46.9%, 52%, 49.3%, and 45.5%, respectively, compared with 58.1%, 46.5%, 66.6%, and 32.6% in Group B. Stiffness of the construct was increased by 77.8%, 59.8%, 67.8%, and 258.9% in flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and axial rotation, respectively, in Group A compared with 80.6%, 56.1%, 82.6%, and 121.2% in Group B; no statistical difference between the two groups was observed. CONCLUSIONS: SSPI has comparable stiffness to that of circumferential fixation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomechanical study", "Burst fracture", "Circumferential fixation", "Lumbar spine", "Posterior short-segment fixation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cattle", "Fracture Fixation, Internal", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Lumbar Vertebrae", "Motion", "Spinal Fractures", "Thoracic Vertebrae", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012833915", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55324883100": {"Name": "Sait A.", "AuthorID": "55324883100", "AffiliationID": "60000653", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Disorders Surgery Unit, Department of Orthopaedics, Christian Medical College"}, "55629276700": {"Name": "Sekharappa V.", "AuthorID": "55629276700", "AffiliationID": "60000653", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Disorders Surgery Unit, Department of Orthopaedics, Christian Medical College"}, "10339099100": {"Name": "David K.", "AuthorID": "10339099100", "AffiliationID": "60000653", "AffiliationName": "Spinal Disorders Surgery Unit, Department of Orthopaedics, Christian Medical College"}, "35776895300": {"Name": "Prabhav N.", "AuthorID": "35776895300", "AffiliationID": "60010618", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology"}, "57211913054": {"Name": "Rajan R.", "AuthorID": "57211913054", "AffiliationID": "60010618", "AffiliationName": "Division of Photonics and Medical Physics, Vellore Institute of Technology"}, "18433448200": {"Name": "Nambi Raj N.", "AuthorID": "18433448200", "AffiliationID": "60010618", "AffiliationName": "Division of Photonics and Medical Physics, Vellore Institute of Technology"}}}
