PCA is the most frequent atypical presentation of Alzheimer disease. The purpose of this article is to provide a summary of PCA's neuropsychiatric manifestations. Emotional and psychotic symptoms are discussed in the context of signal characteristic features of the PCA syndrome (the early onset, focal loss of visual perception, focal posterior brain atrophy) and the underlying cause of the disease. The authors' experience with psychotherapeutic intervention and PCA support groups is shared in detail.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apathy", "Depression", "Neuropsychiatry manifestations (NPM)", "PCA", "Peer support", "Posterior atrophy", "Visual impairment", "Young-onset dementia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Behavioral Symptoms", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognitive Therapy", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Vision Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929655702", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"26431133100": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Gonz\u00e1lez A.", "AuthorID": "26431133100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "9333354500": {"Name": "Henley S.M.", "AuthorID": "9333354500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56548096800": {"Name": "Walton J.", "AuthorID": "56548096800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.J.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
