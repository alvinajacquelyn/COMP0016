It is hypothesized that the dust is produced via collisions associated with an evolving dust disc, temporarily increasing the emitting surface of warm debris, and is subsequently destroyed or assimilated within a few years. The variations are consistent with debris that does not change temperature, indicating that dust is produced and depleted within a fixed range of orbital radii. Gas produced in collisions may rapidly re-condense onto grains, or may accrete onto the white dwarf surface on viscous timescales that are considerably longer than Poynting-Robertson drag for micron-sized dust. This potential delay in mass accretion rate change is consistent with multi-epoch spectra of the unchanging Ca II and MgII absorption features in GD56 over 15 yr, although the sampling is sparse. Overall, these results indicate that collisions are likely to be the source of dust and gas, either inferred or observed, orbiting most or all polluted white dwarfs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circumstellar matter", "planetary systems", "stars: individual: GD56", "white dwarfs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060887758", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57203394181": {"Name": "Farihi J.", "AuthorID": "57203394181", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57191980484": {"Name": "Wilson T.G.", "AuthorID": "57191980484", "AffiliationID": "60010968", "AffiliationName": "Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes"}, "57205626086": {"Name": "Swan A.", "AuthorID": "57205626086", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "43361815000": {"Name": "van Lieshout R.", "AuthorID": "43361815000", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "57203609100": {"Name": "Rogers L.", "AuthorID": "57203609100", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "36668296200": {"Name": "Bonsor A.", "AuthorID": "36668296200", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55340025300": {"Name": "Cauley P.W.", "AuthorID": "55340025300", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department and Van Vleck Observatory, Wesleyan University"}, "57191359396": {"Name": "Dennihy E.", "AuthorID": "57191359396", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "26326482200": {"Name": "Su K.Y.L.", "AuthorID": "26326482200", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "7102051317": {"Name": "Kenyon S.J.", "AuthorID": "7102051317", "AffiliationID": "60008668", "AffiliationName": "Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory"}, "36012227500": {"Name": "Toloza O.", "AuthorID": "36012227500", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "7004303221": {"Name": "G\u00e4nsicke B.T.", "AuthorID": "7004303221", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Exoplanets and Habitability, University of Warwick"}, "56801505100": {"Name": "Pala A.F.", "AuthorID": "56801505100", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "57217745012": {"Name": "von Hippel T.", "AuthorID": "57217745012", "AffiliationID": "60028872", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Department, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University"}, "6603699060": {"Name": "Redfield S.", "AuthorID": "6603699060", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department and Van Vleck Observatory, Wesleyan University"}, "7003376187": {"Name": "Debes J.H.", "AuthorID": "7003376187", "AffiliationID": "60008158", "AffiliationName": "Space Telescope Science Institute"}, "36607081600": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "36607081600", "AffiliationID": "60033467", "AffiliationName": "Gemini Observatory, Northern Operations"}, "7006392485": {"Name": "Reach W.T.", "AuthorID": "7006392485", "AffiliationID": "60004179", "AffiliationName": "SOFIA-USRA, NASA Ames Research Center"}}}
