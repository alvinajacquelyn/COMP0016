We systematically assessed the inter- and intra-rater reliability of ICH classification systems. Methods: We sought all available reliability assessments of anatomical and mechanistic ICH classification systems from electronic databases and personal contacts until October 2014. We assessed included studies\u2019 characteristics, reporting quality and potential for bias; summarized reliability with kappa value forest plots; and performed meta-analyses of the proportion of cases classified into each subtype. Summary of review: We included 8 of 2152 studies identified. Inter- and intra-rater reliabilities were substantial to perfect for anatomical and mechanistic systems (inter-rater kappa values: anatomical 0.78\u20130.97 [six studies, 518 cases], mechanistic 0.89\u20130.93 [three studies, 510 cases]; intra-rater kappas: anatomical 0.80\u20131 [three studies, 137 cases], mechanistic 0.92\u20130.93 [two studies, 368 cases]). Reporting quality varied but no study fulfilled all criteria and none was free from potential bias. All reliability studies were performed with experienced raters in specialist centers. Proportions of ICH subtypes were largely consistent with previous reports suggesting that included studies are appropriately representative. Conclusions: Reliability of existing classification systems appears excellent but is unknown outside specialist centers with experienced raters. Future reliability comparisons should be facilitated by studies following recently published reporting guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebral hemorrhage", "cerebrovascular disorders", "classification system", "reliability", "reproducibility of results", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Humans", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979887677", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"56098493800": {"Name": "Rannikm\u00e4e K.", "AuthorID": "56098493800", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56533824200": {"Name": "Woodfield R.", "AuthorID": "56533824200", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "15842833200": {"Name": "Al-Shahi Salman R.", "AuthorID": "15842833200", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "7004552277": {"Name": "Sudlow C.L.M.", "AuthorID": "7004552277", "AffiliationID": "60111912", "AffiliationName": "UK Biobank"}, "14824521200": {"Name": "Anderson C.S.", "AuthorID": "14824521200", "AffiliationID": "60018150, 60025709, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "The George Institute for Global Health, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and the University of Sydney"}, "36676862000": {"Name": "Charidimou A.", "AuthorID": "36676862000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Group, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Group, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6508226085": {"Name": "Chiewvit P.", "AuthorID": "6508226085", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University"}, "57203056693": {"Name": "Greenberg S.M.", "AuthorID": "57203056693", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "6701794559": {"Name": "Rosand J.", "AuthorID": "6701794559", "AffiliationID": "60001001", "AffiliationName": "Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute"}, "15842090600": {"Name": "Jeng J.S.", "AuthorID": "15842090600", "AffiliationID": "60073385", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Center and Department of Neurology, National Taiwan University Hospital"}, "25822827900": {"Name": "Yeh S.J.", "AuthorID": "25822827900", "AffiliationID": "60073385", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Center and Department of Neurology, National Taiwan University Hospital"}, "12775885500": {"Name": "Meretoja A.", "AuthorID": "12775885500", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine and the Florey, Royal Melbourne Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "26531906100": {"Name": "Putaala J.", "AuthorID": "26531906100", "AffiliationID": "60016987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Helsinki University Central Hospital"}, "8769093300": {"Name": "Strbian D.", "AuthorID": "8769093300", "AffiliationID": "60016987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Helsinki University Central Hospital"}, "55166546900": {"Name": "Tatlisumak T.", "AuthorID": "55166546900", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "16319848200": {"Name": "Palm F.", "AuthorID": "16319848200", "AffiliationID": "60022960", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, St\u00e4dtisches Klinikum Ludwigshafen"}, "56140431400": {"Name": "Rinkel G.J.E.", "AuthorID": "56140431400", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "35269850500": {"Name": "Rost N.S.", "AuthorID": "35269850500", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "16235500900": {"Name": "Tsai C.F.", "AuthorID": "16235500900", "AffiliationID": "60005101, 60014945", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Cardinal Tien Hospital, School of Medicine, Fu-Jen Catholic University"}, "6602351638": {"Name": "Wermer M.J.H.", "AuthorID": "6602351638", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center"}}}
