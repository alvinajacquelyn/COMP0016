The thin films of GaAs on glass substrates were found to have good crystallinity with crystallites as large as 150 nm and low contamination with experimental results matching well with theoretical density of states calculations. These results open up a route to efficient and cost-effective scale up of GaAs thin films with high material properties for widespread industrial use. Confirmation of film quality was determined using XRD, Raman, EDX mapping, SEM, HRTEM, XPS, and SIMS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient pressures", "Cost effective", "Crystallinities", "GaAs thin films", "Glass substrates", "Industrial use", "Solution-processed", "Theoretical density"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964562591", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "53163106200": {"Name": "Bhachu D.", "AuthorID": "53163106200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56736199700": {"Name": "Buckeridge J.", "AuthorID": "56736199700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Kathleen Lonsdale Materials Chemistry, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "9839704400": {"Name": "Arnepalli R.", "AuthorID": "9839704400", "AffiliationID": "60012222", "AffiliationName": "Applied Materials Inc."}, "57210548526": {"Name": "Kumar B.", "AuthorID": "57210548526", "AffiliationID": "60012222", "AffiliationName": "Applied Materials Inc."}, "56323894100": {"Name": "Singh K.", "AuthorID": "56323894100", "AffiliationID": "60012222", "AffiliationName": "Applied Materials Inc."}, "7103351361": {"Name": "Visser R.", "AuthorID": "7103351361", "AffiliationID": "60012222", "AffiliationName": "Applied Materials Inc."}}}
