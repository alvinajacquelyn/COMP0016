Here, a simple and effective method for re-activating sintered Pd NPs decorated on carbon supports is demonstrated using HNO3 vapour at mild temperatures in a closed system, without loss in the Pd content. We further reveal that nitrogen oxide play an important role in the re-dispersion of Pd NPs. In a catalytic phenol hydrogenation reaction, the re-dispersed NPs exhibit superior catalytic activity as compared to sintered Pd NPs supported on CNTs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon support", "Closed systems", "Facile method", "Mild temperatures", "PD nano particle", "Phenol hydrogenation", "Strong dependences", "Uniform dispersions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958758306", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"56176827900": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "56176827900", "AffiliationID": "60020745, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57129239900": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "57129239900", "AffiliationID": "60020745, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56237613100": {"Name": "Ding Y.", "AuthorID": "56237613100", "AffiliationID": "60020745, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8542070400": {"Name": "Wen G.", "AuthorID": "8542070400", "AffiliationID": "60020745, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7201718070": {"Name": "Su D.", "AuthorID": "7201718070", "AffiliationID": "60020745, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56457737500": {"Name": "Hamid S.", "AuthorID": "56457737500", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Nanotechnology and Catalysis Research Centre (NANOCAT), University of Malaya"}}}
