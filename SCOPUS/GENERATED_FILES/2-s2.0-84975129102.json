This paper presents the findings of a small-scale research project carried out to understand Muslim teachers\u2019 perspectives on the standards, and FBVs in particular. Though the teachers made several criticisms of FBVs, they did not see any incompatibility between FBVs and their conception of Islamic values. The paper proposes that the teachers\u2019 responses reflect Rawlsian \u2018overlapping consensus\u2019 and situates the roots of this consensus in contemporary Muslim intellectual history and the modernist reforms. Finally, a case is made that the teachers\u2019 responses problematise the essentialised understanding of terms such as \u2018Islam\u2019 and \u2018the West\u2019 and indicate the interpretive and open-ended nature of cultures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["extremism", "Fundamental British Values", "Islam and West", "Islamic education", "Muslim education", "Teachers\u2019 Standards"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975129102", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8842676300": {"Name": "Panjwani F.", "AuthorID": "8842676300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Curriculum, Pedagogy and Assessment, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
