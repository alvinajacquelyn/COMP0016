All Rights Reserved.Background: Efforts are underway to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020. Programmatic guidelines are based on clinical signs that correlate poorly with Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infection in post-treatment and low-endemicity settings. Age-specific seroprevalence of anti Ct Pgp3 antibodies has been proposed as an alternative indicator of the need for intervention. To standardise the use of these tools, it is necessary to develop an analytical approach that performs reproducibly both within and between studies. Methodology: Dried blood spots were collected in 2014 from children aged 1\u20139 years in Laos (n = 952) and Uganda (n = 2700) and from people aged 1\u201390 years in The Gambia (n = 1868). Anti-Pgp3 antibodies were detected by ELISA. A number of visual and statistical analytical approaches for defining serological status were compared. Principal Findings: Seroprevalence was estimated at 11.3% (Laos), 13.4% (Uganda) and 29.3% (The Gambia) by visual inspection of the inflection point. The expectation-maximisation algorithm estimated seroprevalence at 10.4% (Laos), 24.3% (Uganda) and 29.3% (The Gambia). Finite mixture model estimates were 15.6% (Laos), 17.1% (Uganda) and 26.2% (The Gambia). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using a threshold calibrated against external reference specimens estimated the seroprevalence at 6.7% (Laos), 6.8% (Uganda) and 20.9% (The Gambia) when the threshold was set to optimise Youden\u2019s J index. The ROC curve analysis was found to estimate seroprevalence at lower levels than estimates based on thresholds established using internal reference data. Thresholds defined using internal reference threshold methods did not vary substantially between population samples. Conclusions: Internally calibrated approaches to threshold specification are reproducible and consistent and thus have advantages over methods that require external calibrators. We propose that future serological analyses in trachoma use a finite mixture model or expectation-maximisation algorithm as a means of setting the threshold for ELISA data. This will facilitate standardisation and harmonisation between studies and eliminate the need to establish and maintain a global calibration standard.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antibodies, Bacterial", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Disease Eradication", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Trachoma", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012909879", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57193313743": {"Name": "Migchelsen S.J.", "AuthorID": "57193313743", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "57203174951": {"Name": "Solomon A.W.", "AuthorID": "57203174951", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, World Health Organization"}, "7201661621": {"Name": "Holland M.J.", "AuthorID": "7201661621", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "56400433900": {"Name": "Mabey D.C.W.", "AuthorID": "56400433900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "35559747300": {"Name": "Roberts C.h.", "AuthorID": "35559747300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Department, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7406285982": {"Name": "Martin D.L.", "AuthorID": "7406285982", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "57207594248": {"Name": "Cooley G.", "AuthorID": "57207594248", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of Parasitic Diseases and Malaria, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "57191963607": {"Name": "Southisombath K.", "AuthorID": "57191963607", "AffiliationID": "115285453", "AffiliationName": "Center for Ophthalmology, Ministry of Health"}, "57193308478": {"Name": "Turyaguma P.", "AuthorID": "57193308478", "AffiliationID": "60071670", "AffiliationName": "Trachoma Control Programmen Ministry of Health"}, "56610349600": {"Name": "Heggen A.", "AuthorID": "56610349600", "AffiliationID": "118103791", "AffiliationName": "NTD Support Centre"}, "57193311288": {"Name": "Rubangakene P.P.", "AuthorID": "57193311288", "AffiliationID": "60032205", "AffiliationName": "ENVISION PROGRAMME, RTI International"}, "6508041668": {"Name": "Joof H.", "AuthorID": "6508041668", "AffiliationID": "114111086", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia"}, "8597998700": {"Name": "Makalo P.", "AuthorID": "8597998700", "AffiliationID": "114111086", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia"}, "57150831300": {"Name": "Gwyn S.", "AuthorID": "57150831300", "AffiliationID": "60138440, 60021658", "AffiliationName": "IHRC, Inc., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "7005139647": {"Name": "Courtright P.", "AuthorID": "7005139647", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Kilimanjaro Centre for Community Ophthalmology, University Cape Town"}, "56719170600": {"Name": "Willis R.", "AuthorID": "56719170600", "AffiliationID": "108290871", "AffiliationName": "International Trachoma Initiative, The Task Force for Global Health"}, "7203015251": {"Name": "Alexander N.D.E.", "AuthorID": "7203015251", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Tropical Epidemiology Group, Infectious Disease Epidemiology Department, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}}}
