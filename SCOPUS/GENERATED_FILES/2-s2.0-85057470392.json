In recent years, several empirically-validated psychotherapeutic treatments have been developed, including Mentalisation-Based Therapy, which is an integrative psychodynamic approach created in Britain. Although numerous studies have showed Mentalisation-Based Therapy to be an efficient treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder, its specific components have yet to be assessed. Furthermore, there have been no empirical studies conducted among groups of French-speaking patients. The purpose of this study is twofold: To provide an initial assessment of the efficacy of the mentalisation-based psycho-educational component, which is the first component of any mentalisation-based therapy, and to provide the first assessment of this approach among a population of French-speaking patients. Method: Over a three-month period, 14 Borderline Personality Disorder sufferers followed a psycho-educational Mentalisation-Based Therapy programme consisting of group sessions to introduce patients to mentalisation and weekly individual interviews. Patients filled in various question forms assessing, among others, the intensity of their depression, their degree of hopelessness, their emotional regulation strategies, and their reflective abilities. Results: The psycho-educational component of Mentalisation-Based Therapy is significantly associated with improved cognitive emotional regulation, empathy and reflective abilities, and with a reduced sense of hopelessness. The programme retention rate was of 71.4%. Conclusion: Despite the small sample size and the short treatment period, these preliminary results demonstrate the efficiency of the psycho-educational phase of Mentalisation-Based Therapy, and in particular the positive effects of the treatment on depressive symptomatology and self-regulation processes among patients with a Borderline Personality Disorder diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borderline personality disorder", "Mentalisation", "Psychotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Borderline Personality Disorder", "Culture", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Male", "Mentalization", "Psychotherapy", "Self Concept", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Switzerland", "Theory of Mind", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057470392", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55191487800": {"Name": "Prada P.", "AuthorID": "55191487800", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Service des sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s psychiatriques, d\u00e9partement de sant\u00e9 mentale et de psychiatrie, h\u00f4pitaux universitaires de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "53979404300": {"Name": "Badoud D.", "AuthorID": "53979404300", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de psychologie clinique d\u00e9veloppementale, facult\u00e9 de psychologie et des sciences de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "6506937700": {"Name": "Nicastro R.", "AuthorID": "6506937700", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Service des sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s psychiatriques, d\u00e9partement de sant\u00e9 mentale et de psychiatrie, h\u00f4pitaux universitaires de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "36124689300": {"Name": "Dieben K.", "AuthorID": "36124689300", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Service des sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s psychiatriques, d\u00e9partement de sant\u00e9 mentale et de psychiatrie, h\u00f4pitaux universitaires de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "57195952466": {"Name": "R\u00fcfenacht E.", "AuthorID": "57195952466", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Service des sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s psychiatriques, d\u00e9partement de sant\u00e9 mentale et de psychiatrie, h\u00f4pitaux universitaires de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "15724420800": {"Name": "Dayer A.", "AuthorID": "15724420800", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partment des neurosciences de base, universit\u00e9 de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "23470451800": {"Name": "Perroud N.", "AuthorID": "23470451800", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Service des sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9s psychiatriques, d\u00e9partement de sant\u00e9 mentale et de psychiatrie, h\u00f4pitaux universitaires de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "8724552100": {"Name": "Debban\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "8724552100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de recherche en psychologie clinique, de l\u2019\u00e9ducation et de la sant\u00e9, University College London"}}}
