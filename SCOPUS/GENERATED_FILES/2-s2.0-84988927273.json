This hard deployment and management border on compute, memory, network and storage resources is either fixed or quite limited in expandability during design time and in practice remains so throughout machine lifetime as subsystem upgrades are seldomely employed. The impact of this rigidity has well known ramifications in terms of lower system resource utilization, costly upgrade cycles and degraded energy proportionality. In the dReDBox project we take on the challenge of breaking the server boundaries through materialization of the concept of disaggregation. The basic idea of the dReDBox architecture is to use a core of high-speed, low-latency opto-electronic fabric that will bring physically distant components more closely in terms of latency and bandwidth. We envision a powerful software-defined control plane that will match the flexibility of the system to the resource needs of the applications (or VMs) running in the system. Together the hardware, interconnect, and software architectures will enable the creation of a modular, vertically-integrated system that will form a datacenter-in-a-box.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Building blockes", "Computing system", "Energy proportionalities", "Hardware components", "Storage resources", "System hardware", "System resource utilization", "Vertically integrated system"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988927273", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55925321900": {"Name": "Katrinis K.", "AuthorID": "55925321900", "AffiliationID": "60108035", "AffiliationName": "IBM Research-Ireland"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "HPN Group, University of Bristol"}, "57189515863": {"Name": "Chen Q.", "AuthorID": "57189515863", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "HPN Group, University of Bristol"}, "6602340038": {"Name": "Pnevmatikatos D.", "AuthorID": "6602340038", "AffiliationID": "60022461", "AffiliationName": "FORTH-ICS and Technical University of Crete"}, "25930211400": {"Name": "Theodoropoulos D.", "AuthorID": "25930211400", "AffiliationID": "60022461", "AffiliationName": "FORTH-ICS and Technical University of Crete"}, "26425368500": {"Name": "Syrivelis D.", "AuthorID": "26425368500", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "University of Thessaly"}, "54584899300": {"Name": "Alexoudi T.", "AuthorID": "54584899300", "AffiliationID": "60025812", "AffiliationName": "University of Thessaly"}, "55814465100": {"Name": "Raho D.", "AuthorID": "55814465100", "AffiliationID": "113774968", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Open Systems"}, "57193345163": {"Name": "Pinto C.", "AuthorID": "57193345163", "AffiliationID": "113774968", "AffiliationName": "Virtual Open Systems"}, "26422933000": {"Name": "Espina F.", "AuthorID": "26422933000", "AffiliationID": "113124076", "AffiliationName": "NAUDIT HPCN"}, "6602113304": {"Name": "Lopez-Buedo S.", "AuthorID": "6602113304", "AffiliationID": "113124076", "AffiliationName": "NAUDIT HPCN"}, "6701312944": {"Name": "Nemirovsky M.", "AuthorID": "6701312944", "AffiliationID": "60097745", "AffiliationName": "Barcelona Supercomputing Center"}, "56950644500": {"Name": "Roca D.", "AuthorID": "56950644500", "AffiliationID": "60097745", "AffiliationName": "Barcelona Supercomputing Center"}, "57189645750": {"Name": "Klos H.", "AuthorID": "57189645750", "AffiliationID": "119083719", "AffiliationName": "SINTECS"}, "57189640025": {"Name": "Berends T.", "AuthorID": "57189640025", "AffiliationID": "119083719", "AffiliationName": "SINTECS"}}}
