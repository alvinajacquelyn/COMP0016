Aims: The current study investigates how people with persecutory delusions interpret events in a virtual neutral social environment using qualitative methodology. Method: 20 participants with persecutory delusions and 20 controls entered a virtual underground train containing neutral characters. Under these circumstances, people with persecutory delusions reported similar levels of paranoia as non-clinical participants. The transcripts of a post-virtual reality interview of the first 10 participants in each group were analysed. Results: Thematic analyses of interviews focusing on the decision making process associated with attributing intentions of computer-generated characters revealed 11 themes grouped in 3 main categories (evidence in favour of paranoid appraisals, evidence against paranoid appraisals, other behaviour). Conclusions: People with current persecutory delusions are able to use a range of similar strategies to healthy volunteers when making judgements about potential threat in a neutral environment that does not elicit anxiety, but they are less likely than controls to engage in active hypothesis-testing and instead favour experiencing affect as evidence of persecutory intention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis", "Paranoia", "persecutory delusions", "safety behaviours", "virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Paranoid Disorders", "Qualitative Research", "Schizophrenia, Paranoid", "Social Environment", "Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921512301", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"10539636700": {"Name": "Fornells-Ambrojo M.", "AuthorID": "10539636700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6508057689": {"Name": "Swapp D.", "AuthorID": "6508057689", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "15059870100": {"Name": "Antley A.", "AuthorID": "15059870100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7201818552": {"Name": "Barker C.", "AuthorID": "7201818552", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57202665457": {"Name": "Freeman D.", "AuthorID": "57202665457", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "7202932472": {"Name": "Slater M.", "AuthorID": "7202932472", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA- University of Barcelona"}}}
