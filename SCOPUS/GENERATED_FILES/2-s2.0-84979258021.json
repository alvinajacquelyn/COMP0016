Experimental data were processed in terms of the Haward model with allowance for the non-Gaussian statistics of macromolecules at high strain and limited extensibility and the so-called \u201cslip-link\u201d model, which considers the density of labile knots and permanent entanglements. Despite obvious simplifications, both models attribute the discovered extrema of the concentration dependences of mechanical properties at low concentrations of nanodiamonds to the change in the number of segments between network knots and the following change in elastic modulus (Haward model) or to the number of labile and permanent knots (\u201cslip-link\u201d model), a circumstance that verifies the nucleating effect of nanodiamonds. It was found that the relative increase in density of each type of knot significantly depends on the degree of crystallinity of the matrix and the concentration of the modifier. Deformation calorimetry showed that tensile and cyclic loading of the investigated systems are followed by changes in internal energy. The roles of its intramolecular and intermolecular components at the various stages of deformation and the causes of their changes were estimated. The correlation between energy effects and the transformation of the structuring and parameters of the used models was determined.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Concentration dependence", "Deformation calorimetry", "Deformation mechanism", "Degree of crystallinity", "Detonation nanodiamonds", "Mechanical parameters", "Non-Gaussian statistics", "Rubber-like elasticities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979258021", "SubjectAreas": [["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7003956672": {"Name": "Bessonova N.", "AuthorID": "7003956672", "AffiliationID": "60021340", "AffiliationName": "Karpov Institute of Physical Chemistry"}, "7007026539": {"Name": "Krasheninnikov S.", "AuthorID": "7007026539", "AffiliationID": "60021340", "AffiliationName": "Karpov Institute of Physical Chemistry"}, "55211283400": {"Name": "Odarchenko Y.", "AuthorID": "55211283400", "AffiliationID": "60096190, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Enikolopov Institute of Synthetic Polymer Materials, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "57190343788": {"Name": "Kharlamova E.", "AuthorID": "57190343788", "AffiliationID": "60096190, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Enikolopov Institute of Synthetic Polymer Materials, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "23486997600": {"Name": "Tomilina E.", "AuthorID": "23486997600", "AffiliationID": "60096190, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Enikolopov Institute of Synthetic Polymer Materials, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "7007011596": {"Name": "Chvalun S.", "AuthorID": "7007011596", "AffiliationID": "60096190, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Enikolopov Institute of Synthetic Polymer Materials, Russian Academy of Sciences"}}}
