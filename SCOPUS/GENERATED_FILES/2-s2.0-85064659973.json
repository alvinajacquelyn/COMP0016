This study used a reading ability-matched design to examine group differences in both procedural and declarative learning. Both children with dyslexia and typically developing children demonstrated procedural learning on a serial reaction time task, although learning in the typically developing group increased at a greater rate towards the end of the task compared with children with dyslexia. However, these results do not provide strong evidence for the procedural deficit hypothesis, because poorer procedural learning in the group with dyslexia may reflect impairments in motor learning, rather than sequence specific procedural learning. In addition, neither group showed a relationship between procedural learning and reading ability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["declarative learning", "dyslexia", "language", "memory", "procedural learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Development", "Cognition", "Dyslexia", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Reaction Time", "Reading", "Task Performance and Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064659973", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57193484539": {"Name": "West G.", "AuthorID": "57193484539", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oxford"}, "7006105965": {"Name": "Hulme C.", "AuthorID": "7006105965", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oxford"}, "57196244328": {"Name": "Clayton F.J.", "AuthorID": "57196244328", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of York"}, "7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.R.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
