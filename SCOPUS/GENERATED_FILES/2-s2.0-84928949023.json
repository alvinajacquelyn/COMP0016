In the setting of liver cirrhosis, it is characterized by a blunted inotropic and chronotropic response to stress, impaired diastolic relaxation of the myocardium and prolongation of the QT interval in the absence of other known cardiac disease. A key pathological feature is the persistent over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system in cirrhosis, which leads to down-regulation and dysfunction of the \u03b2-adrenergic receptor. Diagnosis can be made using a combination of echocardiography (resting and stress), tissue Doppler imaging, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, 12-lead electrocardiogram and measurement of biomarkers. There are significant implications of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy in a number of clinical situations in which there is an increased physiological demand, which can lead to acute cardiac decompensation and heart failure. Prior to transplantation there is an increased risk of hepatorenal syndrome, cardiac failure following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion and increased risk of arrhythmias during acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Liver transplantation presents the greatest physiological challenge with a further risk of acute cardiac decompensation. Peri-operative management should involve appropriate choice of graft and minimization of large fluctuations in preload and afterload. The avoidance of cardiac failure during this period has important prognostic implications, as there is evidence to suggest a long-term resolution of the abnormalities in cirrhotic cardiomyopathy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy", "Diastolic dysfunction", "Electrophysiological abnormalities", "Liver transplantation", "Perioperative care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928949023", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"56623867600": {"Name": "Rahman S.", "AuthorID": "56623867600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free London NHS Trust"}, "7004053133": {"Name": "Mallett S.V.", "AuthorID": "7004053133", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free London NHS Trust"}}}
