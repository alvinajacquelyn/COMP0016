The risk of death among these patients, however, varies greatly because of their clinical characteristics. We developed a risk prediction model for 30-day postoperative mortality to enable better comparison of outcomes between hospitals. Methods: We analysed data from the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) on patients having an emergency laparotomy between December 2013 and November 2015. A prediction model was developed using multivariable logistic regression, with potential risk factors identified from existing prediction models, national guidelines, and clinical experts. Continuous risk factors were transformed if necessary to reflect their non-linear relationship with 30-day mortality. The performance of the model was assessed in terms of its calibration and discrimination. Interval validation was conducted using bootstrap resampling. Results: There were 4458 (11.5%) deaths within 30-days among the 38 830 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Variables associated with death included (among others): age, blood pressure, heart rate, physiological variables, malignancy, and ASA physical status classification. The predicted risk of death among patients ranged from 1% to 50%. The model demonstrated excellent calibration and discrimination, with a C-statistic of 0.863 (95% confidence interval, 0.858\u20130.867). The model retained its high discrimination during internal validation, with a bootstrap derived C-statistic of 0.861. Conclusions: The NELA risk prediction model for emergency laparotomies discriminates well between low- and high-risk patients and is suitable for producing risk-adjusted provider mortality statistics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["emergency laparotomy", "postoperative mortality", "postoperative outcome", "risk adjustment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Emergency Medical Services", "Female", "Forecasting", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Laparotomy", "Male", "Medical Audit", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Adjustment", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052080409", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57203531264": {"Name": "Eugene N.", "AuthorID": "57203531264", "AffiliationID": "60008659", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Effectiveness Unit, Royal College of Surgeons of England"}, "56890517400": {"Name": "Oliver C.M.", "AuthorID": "56890517400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Surgical Outcomes Research Centre, Department of Anaesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201401156": {"Name": "Bassett M.G.", "AuthorID": "57201401156", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "57201679058": {"Name": "Poulton T.E.", "AuthorID": "57201679058", "AffiliationID": "114014945", "AffiliationName": "Northern School of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine"}, "56197294600": {"Name": "Kuryba A.", "AuthorID": "56197294600", "AffiliationID": "60008659", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Effectiveness Unit, Royal College of Surgeons of England"}, "56625499800": {"Name": "Johnston C.", "AuthorID": "56625499800", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "St George NHS Hospital"}, "7201352553": {"Name": "Anderson I.D.", "AuthorID": "7201352553", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Salford Royal Foundation NHS Trust"}, "15046929200": {"Name": "Moonesinghe S.R.", "AuthorID": "15046929200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Surgical Outcomes Research Centre, Department of Anaesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60025287", "AffiliationName": "Integrative Physiology and Critical Illness Group, Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital Southampton"}, "57207147322": {"Name": "Murray D.M.", "AuthorID": "57207147322", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, James Cook University Hospital"}, "26040692500": {"Name": "Cromwell D.A.", "AuthorID": "26040692500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research & Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "7202489126": {"Name": "Walker K.", "AuthorID": "7202489126", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research & Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "57203525888": {"Name": "Cripps M.", "AuthorID": "57203525888", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57203526113": {"Name": "Cripps P.", "AuthorID": "57203526113", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57203525948": {"Name": "Davies E.", "AuthorID": "57203525948", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57158994300": {"Name": "Drake S.", "AuthorID": "57158994300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6602317411": {"Name": "Galsworthy M.", "AuthorID": "6602317411", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57201507708": {"Name": "Goodwin J.", "AuthorID": "57201507708", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "10244795500": {"Name": "Salih T.", "AuthorID": "10244795500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57195925506": {"Name": "Lourtie J.", "AuthorID": "57195925506", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57203527052": {"Name": "Papadimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "57203527052", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7006456803": {"Name": "Peden C.", "AuthorID": "7006456803", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
