Yet, there is little research on what clinicians believe the barriers and facilitators around practice to be. At the same time, there is also increasing recognition of a theory\u2013practice gap within the field, with calls for more pragmatic uses of theory to inform and improve clinical practice. Using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), a comprehensive, theoretical-led framework, underpinned by 33 behaviour change theories and 128 constructs, clinician perceived barriers and facilitators to SDM are investigated. The sample comprised of 15 clinicians across two sites in England, who took part in qualitative semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Transcripts were analysed using a deductive thematic analysis, and themes were coded under each theoretical domain. Overall, 21 barriers and facilitators for SDM in child and youth mental health were identified across ten domains of the TDF. Under capability, barriers and facilitators were found for knowledge, skills, memory/attention/decision making processes, and behavioural regulation. For opportunity, barriers and facilitators were found for social influences, as well as environmental context and resources. Finally, for motivation, domains covered included: beliefs about consequences, beliefs about capabilities, emotions, and professional role and identity. Findings suggest that a range of barriers and facilitators affect clinicians\u2019 abilities to engage in SDM with young people and parents. Interventions which target different domains related to capability, opportunity and motivation should be developed to better facilitate young people and their families in care and treatment decisions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinician perspectives", "Patient preference", "Qualitative research", "Shared decision making", "Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Patient Preference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053711561", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"24171342400": {"Name": "Hayes D.", "AuthorID": "24171342400", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "56339951200": {"Name": "Edbrooke-Childs J.", "AuthorID": "56339951200", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "57194719547": {"Name": "Town R.", "AuthorID": "57194719547", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "57216973595": {"Name": "Midgley N.", "AuthorID": "57216973595", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}}}
