However, it is unknown if motility improves with successful treatment. Aim To determine if changes in segmental small bowel motility reflect response to anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy after induction and longer term. Methods A total of 46 patients (median 29 years, 19 females) underwent MRE before anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment; 35 identified retrospectively underwent repeat MRE after median 55 weeks of treatment and 11 recruited prospectively after median 12 weeks. Therapeutic response was defined by physician global assessment (retrospective group) or a \u22653 point drop in the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (prospective group), C-reactive protein (CRP) and the MaRIA score. Two independent radiologists measured motility using an MRE image-registration algorithm. We compared motility changes in responders and nonresponders using the Mann-Whitney test. Results Anti-TNF\u03b1 responders had significantly greater improvements in motility (median = 73.4% increase from baseline) than nonresponders (median = 25% reduction, P < 0.001). Improved MRI-measured motility was 93.1% sensitive (95%CI: 78.0-98.1%) and 76.5% specific (95% CI: 52.7-90.4%) for anti-TNF\u03b1 response. Patients with CRP normalisation (<5 mg/L) had significantly greater improvements in motility (median = 73.4% increase) than those with persistently elevated CRP (median = 5.1%, P = 0.035). Individuals with post-treatment MaRIA scores of <11 had greater motility improvements (median = 94.7% increase) than those with post-treatment MaRIA score >11 (median 15.2% increase, P = 0.017). Conclusions Improved MRI-measured small bowel motility accurately detects response to anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy for Crohn's disease, even as early as 12 weeks. Motility MRI may permit early identification of nonresponse to anti-TNF\u03b1 agents, allowing personalised treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Crohn Disease", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Retrospective Studies", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936847532", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"14834275900": {"Name": "Plumb A.A.", "AuthorID": "14834275900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "54886504700": {"Name": "Menys A.", "AuthorID": "54886504700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "35741623700": {"Name": "Prezzi D.", "AuthorID": "35741623700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Imaging, King's College London"}, "37100960500": {"Name": "Bhatnagar G.", "AuthorID": "37100960500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "25930578500": {"Name": "Russo E.", "AuthorID": "25930578500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Imperial College London"}, "57202909166": {"Name": "Orchard T.R.", "AuthorID": "57202909166", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Imperial College London"}, "26027633500": {"Name": "Vega R.", "AuthorID": "26027633500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
