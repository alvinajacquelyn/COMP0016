While not a substitute for classical studies based on primary data collection, analyses of linked administrative data can answer questions that require large sample sizes or detailed data on hard-to-reach populations, and generate evidence with a high level of external validity and applicability for policy making. There are unique challenges in the appropriate research use of linked administrative data, for example with respect to bias from linkage errors where records cannot be linked or are linked together incorrectly. For confidentiality and other reasons, the separation of data linkage processes and analysis of linked data is generally regarded as best practice. However, the \u2018black box\u2019 of data linkage can make it difficult for researchers to judge the reliability of the resulting linked data for their required purposes. This article aims to provide an overview of challenges in linking administrative data for research. We aim to increase understanding of the implications of (i) the data linkage environment and privacy preservation; (ii) the linkage process itself (including data preparation, and deterministic and probabilistic linkage methods) and (iii) linkage quality and potential bias in linked data. We draw on examples from a number of countries to illustrate a range of approaches for data linkage in different contexts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["administrative data", "data accuracy", "Data linkage", "epidemiological studies", "measurement error", "record linkage", "selection bias"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051666151", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"55249873300": {"Name": "Harron K.", "AuthorID": "55249873300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "6602795419": {"Name": "Dibben C.", "AuthorID": "6602795419", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geography and the Lived Environment, University of Edinburgh"}, "55439269600": {"Name": "Boyd J.", "AuthorID": "55439269600", "AffiliationID": "60031226", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Research, Curtin University"}, "7006080205": {"Name": "Hjern A.", "AuthorID": "7006080205", "AffiliationID": "60028378, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "CHESS Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm University"}, "35769003200": {"Name": "Azimaee M.", "AuthorID": "35769003200", "AffiliationID": "60017829", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences"}, "7004455625": {"Name": "Barreto M.L.", "AuthorID": "7004455625", "AffiliationID": "60026004", "AffiliationName": "Center of Data and Knowledge Integration for Health (CIDACS), Instituto Gon\u00e7alo Moniz, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Oswaldo Cruz"}, "7203025236": {"Name": "Goldstein H.", "AuthorID": "7203025236", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
