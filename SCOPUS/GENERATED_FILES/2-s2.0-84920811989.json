We used Whitehall II study data from 277 participants who completed a questionnaire in 2011. Depression was measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) in 2003 and 2008. The association between CES-D depression and self-reported chewing ability was assessed using regression models adjusted for some socio-demographic factors. Participants with depression at some point in their earlier adulthood had an odds ratio (95% CI) of 2\u00b701 (1\u00b706, 3\u00b782) for reporting chewing difficulties in older adulthood, compared to those without depression. The respective odds ratios were 1\u00b742 (0\u00b766, 3\u00b704) for individuals with depression in only one phase, but 3\u00b753 (1\u00b751, 8\u00b724) for those with depression in two phases. In conclusion, while further research is required, there was an association between depression and chewing difficulty that was independent of demographic and socio-economic characteristics. Furthermore, this increased odds for chewing difficulties was primarily among adults that experienced two episodes or a prolonged period of depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chewing difficulties", "Depression", "Oral health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age of Onset", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mastication", "Middle Aged", "Odds Ratio", "Prospective Studies", "Self Report", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Temporomandibular Joint Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920811989", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57220275852": {"Name": "Aljameel A.H.", "AuthorID": "57220275852", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontics and Community Dentistry, King Saud University"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24576354300": {"Name": "Brunner E.J.", "AuthorID": "24576354300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
