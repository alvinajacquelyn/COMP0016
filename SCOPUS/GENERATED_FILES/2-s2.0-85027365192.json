Methods: An online survey was designed to assess the availability, accessibility, quality control and assurance (QC&A), and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) mechanisms for public and private BC early detection. A focus group with local radiologists (n = 3) was held to identify unaddressed challenges and make recommendations for improvement. Results: Major public hospitals offer free detection services with wait times of 1\u20136 months for an appointment. Private institutions offer mammograms for TTD$240 (USD$37) at minimum with same day service. Both sectors report a lack of trained staff. Using 1.2 mammograms per 10,000 women \u226540 years as sufficient, the public sector\u2019s rate of 0.19 mammograms per 10,000 women \u226540 years for screening and diagnosis is inadequate. Program M&E mechanisms, QC&A guidelines for machinery use, delays in receipt of pathology reports, and unreliable drug access are further unaddressed challenges. Conclusion: T&T must first strengthen its human and physical resources, implement M&E and QC&A measures, strengthen cancer care, and address other impediments to BC early detection before investing in nationally organized BC screening.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Early detection", "Health service evaluation", "Primary prevention", "Screening", "Situational analysis", "Trinidad and Tobago"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Breast Neoplasms", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Humans", "Mammography", "Mass Screening", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Trinidad and Tobago"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027365192", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"36809126000": {"Name": "Badal K.", "AuthorID": "36809126000", "AffiliationID": "60071706", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, The University of the West Indies"}, "57217718102": {"Name": "Ali R.", "AuthorID": "57217718102", "AffiliationID": "60071706", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, The University of the West Indies"}, "36607998200": {"Name": "Haraksingh R.", "AuthorID": "36607998200", "AffiliationID": "60071706", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, The University of the West Indies"}, "57195348414": {"Name": "Russel A.", "AuthorID": "57195348414", "AffiliationID": "60071706", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, The University of the West Indies"}, "6508088902": {"Name": "Rampersad F.", "AuthorID": "6508088902", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Medical Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "55317327400": {"Name": "Warner W.A.", "AuthorID": "55317327400", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, Medical Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "23490812800": {"Name": "Toriola A.T.", "AuthorID": "23490812800", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "56459672100": {"Name": "Mohammed H.", "AuthorID": "56459672100", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and STIs, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57192871157": {"Name": "Scheffel H.A.", "AuthorID": "57192871157", "AffiliationID": "60033420", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, York University"}, "57195349446": {"Name": "Moosoodeen M.", "AuthorID": "57195349446", "AffiliationID": "100739189", "AffiliationName": "San Fernando General Hospital"}, "57195035385": {"Name": "Konduru S.", "AuthorID": "57195035385", "AffiliationID": "106054970", "AffiliationName": "Sangre Grande General Hospital"}}}
