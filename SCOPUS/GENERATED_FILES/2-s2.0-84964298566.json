Objectives: To identify subgroups of COPD in ECLIPSE (Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate Endpoints) subjects using cluster analysis and to assess clinically meaningful outcomes of the clusters during 3 years of longitudinal follow-up. Methods: Factor analysis was used to reduce 41 variables determined at recruitment in 2,164 patients with COPD to 13 main factors, and the variables with the highest loading were used for cluster analysis. Clusters were evaluated for their relationship with clinically meaningful outcomes during 3 years of follow-up. The relationships among clinical parameters were evaluated within clusters. Measurements and Main Results: Five subgroups were distinguished using cross-sectional clinical features. These groups differed regarding outcomes. Cluster A included patients with milder disease and had fewer deaths and hospitalizations. Cluster B had less systemic inflammation at baseline but had notable changes in health status and emphysema extent. Cluster C had many comorbidities, evidence of systemic inflammation, and the highest mortality. Cluster D had low FEV1, severe emphysema, and the highest exacerbation and COPD hospitalization rate. Cluster E was intermediate for most variables and may represent a mixed group that includes further clusters. The relationships among clinical variables within clusters differed from that in the entire COPD population. Conclusions: Cluster analysis using baseline data in ECLIPSE identified five COPD subgroups that differ in outcomes and inflammatory biomarkers and show different relationships between clinical parameters, suggesting the clusters represent clinically and biologically different subtypes of COPD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease", "Cluster analysis", "Longitudinal outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964298566", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57202945380": {"Name": "Rennard S.I.", "AuthorID": "57202945380", "AffiliationID": "60016261, 60010796", "AffiliationName": "Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Nebraska, Medical Center"}, "7801570198": {"Name": "Locantore N.", "AuthorID": "7801570198", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "6603879917": {"Name": "Crim C.", "AuthorID": "6603879917", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "7201757920": {"Name": "Edwards L.D.", "AuthorID": "7201757920", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "7401624241": {"Name": "Yates J.C.", "AuthorID": "7401624241", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "36605907200": {"Name": "Delafont B.", "AuthorID": "36605907200", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "6603373403": {"Name": "Tal-Singer R.", "AuthorID": "6603373403", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "36544084500": {"Name": "Miller B.E.", "AuthorID": "36544084500", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "GlaxoSmithKline Research and Development"}, "57203069737": {"Name": "Silverman E.K.", "AuthorID": "57203069737", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60010869, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine and Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7007048536": {"Name": "Celli B.", "AuthorID": "7007048536", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60010869, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine and Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "34573970200": {"Name": "Vestbo J.", "AuthorID": "34573970200", "AffiliationID": "60111801, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory and Allergy Research Group, Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, University Hospital South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005426134": {"Name": "Bakke P.", "AuthorID": "7005426134", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Department of Thoracic Medicine"}, "7005728897": {"Name": "Calverley P.M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005728897", "AffiliationID": "60014875", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity Clinical Sciences Centre, University Hospital Aintree"}, "6603681233": {"Name": "Coxson H.", "AuthorID": "6603681233", "AffiliationID": "60010365, 60027009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "7005733436": {"Name": "Macnee W.", "AuthorID": "7005733436", "AffiliationID": "60010973, 60017780, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh, MRC Centre for Inflammation Research, Queen's Medical Research Institute"}, "35395980800": {"Name": "Wouters E.F.M.", "AuthorID": "35395980800", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "57188924161": {"Name": "Coca I.", "AuthorID": "57188924161", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Institute, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, University Barcelona"}, "7101749378": {"Name": "Agust\u00ed A.", "AuthorID": "7101749378", "AffiliationID": "60102756", "AffiliationName": "CIBER Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES)"}}}
