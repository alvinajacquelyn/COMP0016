All rights reserved.Fractional minimum positive semidefinite rank is defined from r-fold faithful orthogonal representations and it is shown that the projective rank of any graph equals the fractional minimum positive semidefinite rank of its complement. An r-fold version of the traditional definition of minimum positive semidefinite rank of a graph using Hermitian matrices that fit the graph is also presented. This paper also introduces r-fold orthogonal representations of graphs and formalizes the understanding of projective rank as fractional orthogonal rank. Connections of these concepts to quantum theory, including Tsirelson\u2019s problem, are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fractional", "Graph", "Matrix", "Minimum positive semidefinite rank", "Orthogonal representation", "Projective rank", "Tsirelson\u2019s problem"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019765508", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"]], "AuthorData": {"6602178055": {"Name": "Hogben L.", "AuthorID": "6602178055", "AffiliationID": "60026185", "AffiliationName": "American Institute of Mathematics"}, "57189516592": {"Name": "Palmowski K.", "AuthorID": "57189516592", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Iowa State University"}, "53878260000": {"Name": "Roberson D.", "AuthorID": "53878260000", "AffiliationID": "60005510", "AffiliationName": "Division of Mathematical Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, SPMS-MAS-03-01"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
