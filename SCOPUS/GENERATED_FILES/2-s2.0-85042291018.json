Many scholars have argued that resilient cities are more just cities. But what if the process of increasing the resilience of the city as a whole happens at the expense of the rights of certain groups? If urban resilience focuses on the degree to which cities are able to reorganise in creative ways and adapt to shocks, do pervasive inequalities in access to environmental services have an effect on this ability? This book brings together an interdisciplinary and intergeneration group of scholars to examine the contradictions and tensions that develop as they play out in cities of the Global South through a series of empirically grounded case studies spanning cities of Asia, Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042291018", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7402802360": {"Name": "Allen A.", "AuthorID": "7402802360", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Development Planning Unit (DPU), University College London (UCL)"}, "35145521600": {"Name": "Griffin L.", "AuthorID": "35145521600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Development Planning Unit (DPU), University College London (UCL)"}, "13405704500": {"Name": "Johnson C.", "AuthorID": "13405704500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Development Planning Unit (DPU), University College London (UCL)"}}}
