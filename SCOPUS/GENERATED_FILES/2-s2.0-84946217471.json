However, no T2-mapping sequence has ever been validated against actual myocardial water content for edema detection. In addition, these T2-mapping sequences are either time-consuming or require specialized software for data acquisition and/or post-processing, factors impeding their routine clinical use. Our objective was to obtain in vivo validation of a sequence for fast and accurate myocardial T2-mapping (T2 gradient-spin-echo [GraSE]) that can be easily integrated in routine protocols. Methods: The study population comprised 25 pigs. Closed-chest 40 min ischemia/reperfusion was performed in 20 pigs. Pigs were sacrificed at 120 min (n = 5), 24 h (n = 5), 4 days (n = 5) and 7 days (n = 5) after reperfusion, and heart tissue extracted for quantification of myocardial water content. For the evaluation of T2 relaxation time, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scans, including T2 turbo-spin-echo (T2-TSE, reference standard) mapping and T2-GraSE mapping, were performed at baseline and at every follow-up until sacrifice. Five additional pigs were sacrificed after baseline CMR study and served as controls. Results: Acquisition of T2-GraSE mapping was significantly (3-fold) faster than conventional T2-TSE mapping. Myocardial T2 relaxation measurements performed by T2-TSE and T2-GraSE mapping demonstrated an almost perfect correlation (R2 = 0.99) and agreement with no systematic error between techniques. The two T2-mapping sequences showed similarly good correlations with myocardial water content: R2 = 0.75 and R2 = 0.73 for T2-TSE and T2-GraSE mapping, respectively. Conclusions: We present the first in vivo validation of T2-mapping to assess myocardial edema. Given its shorter acquisition time and no requirement for specific software for data acquisition or post-processing, fast T2-GraSE mapping of the myocardium offers an attractive alternative to current CMR sequences for T2 quantification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular magnetic resonance", "Edema", "Imaging", "Myocardial infarction", "T2-mapping", "Water content"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Body Water", "Disease Models, Animal", "Edema, Cardiac", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Myocardium", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "Swine", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946217471", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"26657321100": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Jim\u00e9nez R.", "AuthorID": "26657321100", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Cl\u00ednico San Carlos Spain"}, "55890422200": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Gonz\u00e1lez J.", "AuthorID": "55890422200", "AffiliationID": "60106716", "AffiliationName": "Philips Healthcare"}, "15052868400": {"Name": "Aguero J.", "AuthorID": "15052868400", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) -Acty Madrid"}, "54912584000": {"Name": "Del Trigo M.", "AuthorID": "54912584000", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) -Acty Madrid"}, "56786533400": {"Name": "Gal\u00e1n-Arriola C.", "AuthorID": "56786533400", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC) -Acty Madrid"}, "7202675508": {"Name": "Fuster V.", "AuthorID": "7202675508", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Zena and Michael A.
