It has been well recognized that periodicity is one of the important characteristics of heat demand. Seasonal-trend decomposition based on LOESS (STL) algorithm can analyze the periodicity of a heat demand series, and decompose the series into seasonal and trend components. Then, predicting the seasonal and trend components respectively, and combining their predictions together as the heat demand prediction is a possible way to predict heat demand. In this paper, STL-ENN-ARIMA (SEA), a combined model, was proposed based on the combination of the Elman neural network (ENN) and the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, which are commonly applied to heat demand prediction. ENN and ARIMA are used to predict seasonal and trend components, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SEA model has a promising performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ARIMA model", "combined model", "Elman neural network", "Heat demand prediction", "STL decomposition"], "IndexKeywords": ["ARIMA modeling", "Autoregressive integrated moving average models", "Combined model", "Elman neural network", "Elman neural networks (ENN)", "Heat demand prediction", "Intelligent energies", "Research topics"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058338764", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"]], "AuthorData": {"57194551358": {"Name": "Xie J.", "AuthorID": "57194551358", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems Lab., Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "57205027313": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "57205027313", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems Lab., Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "55479111500": {"Name": "Ma Z.", "AuthorID": "55479111500", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems Lab., Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "56168336500": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56168336500", "AffiliationID": "60016930", "AffiliationName": "Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems Lab., Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "52364999900": {"Name": "Sun Q.", "AuthorID": "52364999900", "AffiliationID": "60031031", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Thermal Science and Technology, Shandong University"}, "11640367500": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "11640367500", "AffiliationID": "60029368", "AffiliationName": "Tianjin Key Laboratory of Refrigeration Technology, School of Mechanical Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce"}}}
