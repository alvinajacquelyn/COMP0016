We call the acquisition of arguments by means of a chatbot argument harvesting. The chatbot asks the user for his or her arguments on a topic of interest. It can also be used to harvest counterargument, values, preferences, as well as information about the user like his/her personal circumstances. The harvested arguments and other attributes have various applications from the instantiation of argument graphs to the development of computational persuasion systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argument acquisition", "Argument harvesting", "Chatbots"], "IndexKeywords": ["Argument acquisition", "Chatbot", "Chatbots", "Design concept"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053892300", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57194688681": {"Name": "Chalaguine L.", "AuthorID": "57194688681", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7402779550": {"Name": "Hunter A.", "AuthorID": "7402779550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
