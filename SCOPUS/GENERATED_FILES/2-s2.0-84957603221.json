The main risk factor seems to be repeated high-intensity work in hot environments. Several cross-sectional studies have been performed but few longitudinal studies. Objectives: The aim of the study was to examine whether kidney function changes over a few months of work during the harvest period. Methods: A group of male sugarcane cutters in Nicaragua (N=29, aged 17-38 years) was examined with renal biomarkers before and after shift on the first day at the start of harvest, on the sixth day during acclimatization, and then in mid-harvest 9 weeks later. A reference group (N=25, mainly office workers) was examined with the same biomarkers at start of harvest, and then at end of harvest 5 months later. Results: The pre-shift renal function decreased significantly during 9 weeks of work in the cane cutters. Mean serum creatinine increased (20%), mean estimated glomerular filtration rate decreased (9%, 10 mL/min), serum urea N (BUN) increased (41%), and mean urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) increased (four times). The cane cutters also developed cross-shift increases in these biomarkers, in particular serum creatinine and BUN, and in urinary uric acid. The longitudinal decrease in eGFR tended to be associated with the cross-shift increase in serum creatinine. Conclusions: There was a remarkable decrease of glomerular kidney function, after only 9 weeks of harvest. The cross-shift increase in serum creatinine may be caused by dehydration (pre-renal dysfunction), and when repeated on a daily basis this may cause permanently reduced GFR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BUN", "Chronic kidney disease", "EGFR", "Heat stress", "Hsp72", "KIM-1", "NGAL", "Occupational"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Biomarkers", "Farmers", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Function Tests", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Nicaragua", "Saccharum", "Seasons", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957603221", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"7004008573": {"Name": "Wesseling C.", "AuthorID": "7004008573", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Occupational Medicine, Institute of Environmental Medicine (IMM), Karolinska Institutet"}, "57206174933": {"Name": "Arag\u00f3n A.", "AuthorID": "57206174933", "AffiliationID": "112590710", "AffiliationName": "Research Center on Health, Work and Environment (CISTA), Autonomous University of Nicaragua at Le\u00f3n (UNAN-Le\u00f3n)"}, "35798238500": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez M.", "AuthorID": "35798238500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56151203300": {"Name": "Weiss I.", "AuthorID": "56151203300", "AffiliationID": "116266846", "AffiliationName": "La Isla Foundation"}, "56368965600": {"Name": "Glaser J.", "AuthorID": "56368965600", "AffiliationID": "116266846", "AffiliationName": "La Isla Foundation"}, "6701667693": {"Name": "Bobadilla N.A.", "AuthorID": "6701667693", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}, "20533642000": {"Name": "Correa-Rotter R.", "AuthorID": "20533642000", "AffiliationID": "60009149", "AffiliationName": "Department Nephrology and Mineral Metabolism, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias M\u00e9dicas y Nutrici\u00f3n"}, "36632895200": {"Name": "Roncal-Jim\u00e9nez C.", "AuthorID": "36632895200", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado"}, "57209163133": {"Name": "Johnson R.J.", "AuthorID": "57209163133", "AffiliationID": "60028392", "AffiliationName": "Division of Renal Diseases and Hypertension, University of Colorado"}, "55953218700": {"Name": "Barregard L.", "AuthorID": "55953218700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital and University of Gothenburg"}}}
