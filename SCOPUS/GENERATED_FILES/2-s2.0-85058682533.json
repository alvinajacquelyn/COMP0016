Methods Patients from the Dutch-Belgian NTZ-PML cohort (n=28) were reviewed at the time of first diagnostic work-up and during follow-up, using the PML diagnostic criteria as proposed in a consensus statement from the American Academy of Neurology. Results At first diagnostic work-up, 18 patients (64.3%) met the criteria for high diagnostic certainty for PML ('definite PML' or 'probable PML'). During follow-up, this increased to 20 patients (71.4%) as JC virus DNA was detected in cerebrospinal fluid of two additional patients. Nonetheless, 28.6% of patients were still classified as 'possible PML' or 'not PML' (6 (21.5%) and 2 (7.1%) patients, respectively) despite a very high suspicion for PML based on lesion evolution and signs of PML-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome on MRI, and development of compatible symptoms. Conclusions The current case definition of PML has low sensitivity for diagnosis of NTZ-PML in a real-world clinical setting in which MRI is frequently used for PML screening. This may delay diagnosis and appropriate management of PML, and may complicate a valid estimation of PML incidence during NTZ therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnosis", "JC virus", "multiple sclerosis", "natalizumab", "progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Belgium", "Brain", "Cohort Studies", "DNA, Viral", "Early Diagnosis", "Female", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "JC Virus", "Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Natalizumab", "Netherlands", "Pharmacovigilance", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Virus Activation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058682533", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56388730100": {"Name": "Wijburg M.T.", "AuthorID": "56388730100", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Neuroscience Amsterdam, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7006076844": {"Name": "Uitdehaag B.M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006076844", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Amsterdam, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7004423164": {"Name": "Killestein J.", "AuthorID": "7004423164", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Amsterdam, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}, "8302719300": {"Name": "Wattjes M.P.", "AuthorID": "8302719300", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology, Hannover Medical School"}, "8296047800": {"Name": "Warnke C.", "AuthorID": "8296047800", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, University of K\u00f6ln"}}}
