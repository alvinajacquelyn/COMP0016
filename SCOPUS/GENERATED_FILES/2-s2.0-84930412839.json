This paper argues that both are needed to increase resilience. We briefly outline the concept and several recent international resilience-building efforts to elucidate critical questions and less-discussed issues. We highlight the need to move resilience thinking forward by emphasizing structural social-political processes, acknowledging and acting on differences between ecosystems and societies, and looking beyond the quantitative streamlining of resilience into one index. Instead of imposing a technical-reductionist framework, we suggest a starting basis of integrating different knowledge types and experiences to generate scientifically reliable, context-appropriate and socially robust resilience-building activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["co-designing knowledge", "development geography", "disaster risk reduction", "resilience", "vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930412839", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"6602408981": {"Name": "Weichselgartner J.", "AuthorID": "6602408981", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "University of Kiel"}, "23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60028086", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI)"}}}
