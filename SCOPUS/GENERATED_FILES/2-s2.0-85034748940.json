KGaA, WeinheimTissue engineering, gene therapy, drug screening, and emerging regenerative medicine therapies are fundamentally reliant on high-quality adherent cell culture, but current methods to cryopreserve cells in this format can give low cell yields and require large volumes of solvent \u201cantifreezes\u201d. Herein, we report polyproline as a minimum (bio)synthetic mimic of antifreeze proteins that is accessible by solution, solid-phase, and recombinant methods. We demonstrate that polyproline has ice recrystallisation inhibition activity linked to its amphipathic helix and that it enhances the DMSO cryopreservation of adherent cell lines. Polyproline may be a versatile additive in the emerging field of macromolecular cryoprotectants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomaterials", "cryopreservation", "ice recrystallization inhibitors", "monolayers", "polymers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antifreeze protein", "Cell monolayers", "Cryo-preservation", "Cryoprotectants", "Drug screening", "Inhibition activity", "Recrystallisation", "Regenerative medicine", "A549 Cells", "Antifreeze Proteins", "Cryopreservation", "Cryoprotective Agents", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Humans", "Peptides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034748940", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57197785178": {"Name": "Graham B.", "AuthorID": "57197785178", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}, "56927691400": {"Name": "Bailey T.", "AuthorID": "56927691400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}, "18634225400": {"Name": "Gibson M.", "AuthorID": "18634225400", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57211025372": {"Name": "Healey J.", "AuthorID": "57211025372", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "15822609700": {"Name": "Marcellini M.", "AuthorID": "15822609700", "AffiliationID": "60008758", "AffiliationName": "Ceramics Synthesis and Functionalization Lab, UMR3080 CNRS/Saint-Gobain"}, "55940213600": {"Name": "Deville S.", "AuthorID": "55940213600", "AffiliationID": "60008758", "AffiliationName": "Ceramics Synthesis and Functionalization Lab, UMR3080 CNRS/Saint-Gobain"}}}
