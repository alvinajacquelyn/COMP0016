Methods: Seventy patients with mild to moderate PD and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers (HVs) underwent susceptibility-weighted imaging on a 3 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Phase shifts (radians) in deep brain nuclei were derived from high-pass filtered phase images and compared between groups. Analysis of clinical laterality and correlations with motor severity (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III, UPDRS-III) were performed. Phase shifts (in radians) were compared between HVs and three PD subgroups divided according to UPDRS-III scores using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age and regional area. Results: Parkinson's disease patients had significantly (P < 0.001) higher radians than HVs bilaterally in the putamen, globus pallidus and substantia nigra (SN). The SN contralateral to the most affected side showed higher radians (P < 0.001) compared to the less affected side. SN radians positively correlated with UPDRS-III and bradykinesia\u2212rigidity subscores, but not with tremor subscores. ancova followed by post hoc Bonferroni-adjusted pairwise comparisons revealed that SN radians were significantly greater in the PD subgroup with higher UPDRS-III scores compared to both lowest UPDRS-III PD and HV groups (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Increased nigral iron accumulation in PD appears to be stratified according to disease motor severity and correlates with symptoms related to dopaminergic neurodegeneration. This semi-quantitative in vivo iron assessment could prove useful for objectively monitoring PD progression, especially in clinical trials concerning iron chelation therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["iron", "motor severity", "neurodegeneration", "Parkinson's disease", "SWI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Susceptibility", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Hypokinesia", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Iron", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Movement Disorders", "Muscle Rigidity", "Parkinson Disease", "Substantia Nigra"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006963185", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36714151700": {"Name": "Martin-Bastida A.", "AuthorID": "36714151700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "55699841700": {"Name": "Lao-Kaim N.P.", "AuthorID": "55699841700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "36118093600": {"Name": "Loane C.", "AuthorID": "36118093600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Memory Research Group, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Medical Science Division, University of Oxford"}, "24767083800": {"Name": "Politis M.", "AuthorID": "24767083800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegeneration Imaging Group, Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Psychology and Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "57188562332": {"Name": "Roussakis A.A.", "AuthorID": "57188562332", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "7006264864": {"Name": "Piccini P.", "AuthorID": "7006264864", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "57190129174": {"Name": "Valle-Guzman N.", "AuthorID": "57190129174", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "John Van Geest Centre for Brain Repair, University of Cambridge"}, "22985114000": {"Name": "Kefalopoulou Z.", "AuthorID": "22985114000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57192647362": {"Name": "Paul-Visse G.", "AuthorID": "57192647362", "AffiliationID": "60033146, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neurology Group, Department of Clinical Sciences, Wallenberg Neuroscience Centre, >Lund University"}, "7005176883": {"Name": "Widner H.", "AuthorID": "7005176883", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "57192645043": {"Name": "Xing Y.", "AuthorID": "57192645043", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "Radiological Sciences, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre Nottingham"}, "36767740900": {"Name": "Schwarz S.T.", "AuthorID": "36767740900", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "Radiological Sciences, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre Nottingham"}, "7004864007": {"Name": "Auer D.P.", "AuthorID": "7004864007", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "Radiological Sciences, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham, Queen's Medical Centre Nottingham"}, "57198363260": {"Name": "Barker R.A.", "AuthorID": "57198363260", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge"}}}
