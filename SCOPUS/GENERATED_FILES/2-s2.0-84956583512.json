This study aims to investigate the association between social communication and emotion recognition difficulties and second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) and circulating maternal testosterone during pregnancy in a large community-based cohort: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). A secondary aim is to investigate possible gender differences in the associations. Methods: Data on social communication (Social and Communication Disorders Checklist, N = 7165), emotion recognition (emotional triangles, N = 5844 and diagnostics analysis of non-verbal accuracy, N = 7488) and 2D:4D (second to fourth digit ratio, N = 7159) were collected in childhood and early adolescence from questionnaires and face-to-face assessments. Complete data was available on 3515 children. Maternal circulating testosterone during pregnancy was available in a subsample of 89 children. Results: Males had lower 2D:4D ratios than females [t (3513) = -9.775, p < 0.001]. An association was found between measures of social communication and emotion recognition, and the lowest 10 % of 2D:4D ratios. A significant association was found between maternal circulating testosterone and left hand 2D:4D [OR = 1.65, 95 % CI 1.1-2.4, p < 0.01]. Conclusions: Previous findings on the association between 2D:4D and social communication difficulties were not confirmed. A novel association between an extreme measure of 2D:4D in males suggests threshold effects and warrants replication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALSPAC", "Autism", "Emotion recognition difficulties", "Second to fourth digit ratio", "Social communication", "Testosterone"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956583512", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56803731300": {"Name": "Barona M.", "AuthorID": "56803731300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "55770507100": {"Name": "Kothari R.", "AuthorID": "55770507100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "7004857206": {"Name": "Skuse D.", "AuthorID": "7004857206", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Mindich ChildHealth and Development Institute, Icahn Medical School at Mount Sinai"}}}
