Data Two random samples of 5 million patients registered with over 8,000 English family practices followed up for 4 years (2004/5-2007/8). Measures of the quality of disease management for 10 conditions were constructed for each family practice for each year. The outcome measure was an indicator taking the value 1 if the patient died during a specified year, 0 otherwise. Study Design Cross-section and multilevel panel data multiple logistic regressions were estimated. Covariates included age, gender, morbidity, hospitalizations, attributed socio-economic characteristics, and local health care supply measures. Principal Findings Although a composite measure of the quality of disease management for all 10 conditions was significantly associated with lower mortality, only the quality of stroke care was significant when all 10 quality measures were entered in the regression. Conclusions The panel data results suggest that a 1 percent improvement in the quality of stroke care could reduce the annual number of deaths in England by 782 [95 percent CI: 423, 1140]. A longer study period may be necessary to detect any mortality impact of better management of other conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic conditions", "Disease management", "mortality", "primary care", "quality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Chronic Disease", "Comorbidity", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Management", "England", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Primary Health Care", "Quality Indicators, Health Care", "Quality of Health Care", "Sex Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "State Medicine", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942296978", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"6508083572": {"Name": "Dusheiko M.", "AuthorID": "6508083572", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Institut d'\u00c9conomie et Management de la Sant\u00e9, Internef Bureau 532 Universit\u00e9 de Lausanne"}, "7004423323": {"Name": "Gravelle H.", "AuthorID": "7004423323", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "56869261300": {"Name": "Martin S.", "AuthorID": "56869261300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and Related Studies, University of York"}, "7406997415": {"Name": "Smith P.C.", "AuthorID": "7406997415", "AffiliationID": "60116484, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Policy, Imperial College Business School, Imperial College"}}}
