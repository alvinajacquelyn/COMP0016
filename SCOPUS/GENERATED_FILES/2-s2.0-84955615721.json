Post-accession \u2018backsliding\u2019 in Hungary suggests a stronger illiberal challenge. However, we argue, democratic malaise in ECE is better understood as a long-term pattern of \u2018illiberal consolidation\u2019 built on an accommodation between technocratic, economistic liberalism and forces of rent-seeking and cultural conservatism. This configuration generates a mirage of liberal-democratic progress and mainstream moderate politics, which obscures engrained elite collusion and limits to cultural change. Bulgarian-style hollowness, rather than Hungarian-style semi-authoritarianism, better exemplifies the potential fate of ECE democracies today.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955615721", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57077672600": {"Name": "Dawson J.", "AuthorID": "57077672600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006886228": {"Name": "Hanley S.", "AuthorID": "7006886228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
