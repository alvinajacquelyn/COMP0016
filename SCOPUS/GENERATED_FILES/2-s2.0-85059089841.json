Informed by qualitative interviews with 24 such fathers, the article explores a discourse of parental interchangeability that pervaded their accounts before outlining the ways that, in practice, most caregiving tasks did tend to be allocated to them or their partners primarily on the basis of factors other than gender. The men\u2019s comfort in presenting themselves and their partners as interchangeable equivalents, along with the range of caregiving approaches they were taking on, suggests that they had begun to move beyond clearly differentiated motherly or fatherly roles. The study goes on, however, to show that certain emotional, organisational and social aspects of parenting sometimes continued to be centred on mothers. In explaining the endurance of these areas of maternal responsibility within otherwise interchangeable partnerships, mutually reinforcing sets of maternal pressures and paternal barriers are outlined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Family", "fathering", "gender", "masculinity", "parenting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059089841", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"18036987700": {"Name": "Hodkinson P.", "AuthorID": "18036987700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "7402358771": {"Name": "Brooks R.", "AuthorID": "7402358771", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}}}
