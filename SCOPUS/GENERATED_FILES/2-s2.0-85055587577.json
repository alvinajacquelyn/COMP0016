Doctor-led PrEP clinics started at 56 Dean Street in September 2015, with the drug purchased privately at full price. The service was expanded to other staff to support initiation and monitoring of increasing numbers of attendees purchasing PrEP from online pharmacies. Nonetheless, when the clinic was given a target of 1700 for the PrEP Impact trial, it was clear this could not be achieved in a timely manner through 56 Dean Street alone. To prepare for the trial, all staff with HIV testing competencies were trained in good clinical practice and trial-specific procedures, and a patient group directive was approved to facilitate nurse prescribing and dispensing. Electronic pro formas to capture eligibility for starting or continuing PrEP were adapted for the Dean Street Express clinic, with some information collected directly from service users using touch screens. These interventions, together with an update to the 2016 information leaflet developed by the community, enabled enrolment and follow-up of 1700 participants in 4 months. PrEP advice and monitoring were easily accommodated in the 56 Dean Street sexual health service, but did require additional training and approval for nurse prescribing and dispensing drug in order to achieve the target, which still fell short of the demand.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HIV", "PrEP monitoring", "prevention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Anti-HIV Agents", "England", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Organizational Innovation", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Program Evaluation", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Viral"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055587577", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56095010200": {"Name": "Girometti N.", "AuthorID": "56095010200", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23482010600": {"Name": "McCormack S.", "AuthorID": "23482010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College of London (UCL), Aviation House"}, "8218392500": {"Name": "Devitt E.", "AuthorID": "8218392500", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35339119200": {"Name": "Gedela K.", "AuthorID": "35339119200", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603863070": {"Name": "Nwokolo N.", "AuthorID": "6603863070", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403903686": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403903686", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56135884700": {"Name": "Suchak T.", "AuthorID": "56135884700", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603375965": {"Name": "McOwan A.", "AuthorID": "6603375965", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15743409700": {"Name": "Whitlock G.", "AuthorID": "15743409700", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
