The CARMENA trial compared systemic therapy alone with CN followed by systemic therapy. This article outlines the new guidelines based on these data. Patient summary: The CARMENA trial demonstrates that immediate cytoreductive nephrectomy should no longer be considered the standard of care in patients diagnosed with intermediate and poor risk metastatic renal cell carcinoma when medical treatment is required. However, the psychological burden poor risk patients experience hearing that removal of their primary tumour will not be beneficial, should be carefully considered. CARMENA demonstrates that immediate cytoreductive nephrectomy should no longer be considered the standard of care in intermediate- and poor-risk patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma when medical treatment is required. However, the psychological burden that poor-risk patients experience on hearing that removal of their primary tumour will not be beneficial should be carefully considered.
