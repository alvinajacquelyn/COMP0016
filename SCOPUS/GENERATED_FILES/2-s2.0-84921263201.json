M\u00fcller cells are the major source of inflammatory mediators, including IL-6, in the retina. However, the mechanism of regulating IL-6 production in these cells remains unclear. Examination of signaling pathways in human retinal M\u00fcller cells (MIO-M1 cell line) cultured with IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, IFN-\u03b3, glucose or mannitol showed that IL-1\u03b2 was the most potent stimulator of IL-6 production. In addition, IL-1 \u03b2 also increased NF-\u03baB p50 protein level and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, ERK1/2 and c-Jun. Induction of IL-6 production by IL-1\u03b2 was significantly reduced by addition of p38 MAPK (SB203580), MEK1/2 (U0126) or NF-\u03baB (BAY11-7082) inhibitors, with the highest effect being observed with SB203580. To explore the specific elements in IL-6 promoter responsible for IL-1\u03b2-induction of IL-6 expression, a series of plasmids bearing various IL-6 promoter mutations were transiently expressed in MIO-MI cells cultured in the presence or absence of IL-1\u03b2 (10. ng/ml) and/or SB203580 (10. \u03bcM). Results showed that IL-6 promoter activity of the parent pIL-6-Luc651 was significantly enhanced by IL-1\u03b2, but the level was significantly attenuated by SB203580. Furthermore, the IL-6 promoter activity was also reduced upon deletion of NF-\u03baB, AP-1 or C/EBP binding sites, with NF-\u03baB deletion being the greatest. These results are the first demonstration that IL-1\u03b2 induces IL-6 production in M\u00fcller cells by activation of IL-6 promoter activity predominantly through the p38 MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)", "Interleukin 6 (IL-6)", "M\u00fcller cells", "NF-\u03baB", "P38 MAPK", "Promoter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blotting, Western", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Humans", "Interleukin-1beta", "Interleukin-6", "Luciferases", "NF-kappa B", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Phosphorylation", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Retina", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Messenger", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921263201", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56090869200": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "56090869200", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, The First Hospital, Jilin University"}, "47961353500": {"Name": "Song E.", "AuthorID": "47961353500", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "The Ophthalmology Hospital Affiliated Suzhou University"}, "14008384500": {"Name": "Ye F.", "AuthorID": "14008384500", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "56401295900": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "56401295900", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "56401273300": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "56401273300", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "13310178100": {"Name": "Zhang D.", "AuthorID": "13310178100", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7201935463": {"Name": "Xiong H.", "AuthorID": "7201935463", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "57201524004": {"Name": "Peng L.", "AuthorID": "57201524004", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "57206675910": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57206675910", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Immunology Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "16309679600": {"Name": "Hu D.", "AuthorID": "16309679600", "AffiliationID": "60006022", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Culture Center, New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai"}, "56785711800": {"Name": "Limb G.", "AuthorID": "56785711800", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57209146552": {"Name": "Xie T.", "AuthorID": "57209146552", "AffiliationID": "114896408", "AffiliationName": "Department of neurosurgery, The People's Hospital of Jilin Province"}, "16835365200": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "16835365200", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "20936523300": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "20936523300", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "35074388900": {"Name": "Lee P.", "AuthorID": "35074388900", "AffiliationID": "60032105, 60005414, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pathology, Urology, NYU Cancer Institute, New York Harbor Healthcare System, New York University, School of Medicine"}}}
