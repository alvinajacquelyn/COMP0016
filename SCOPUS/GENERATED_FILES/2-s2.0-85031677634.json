Consistent with this view, greater similarity between patterns of activity recorded during encoding and retrieval has been found to predict better memory performance in a number of studies. Recent models have argued that neural oscillations may be crucial to reinstatement for successful memory retrieval. However, to date, no causal evidence has been provided to support this theory, nor has the impact of oscillatory electrical brain stimulation during encoding and retrieval been assessed. To explore this we used transcranial alternating current stimulation over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of human participants [n=70, 45 females; age mean (SD)=22.12 (2.16)] during a declarative memory task. Participants received either the same frequency during encoding and retrieval (60-60 or 90-90 Hz) or different frequencies (60-90 or 90-60 Hz). When frequencies matched there was a significant memory improvement (at both 60 and 90 Hz) relative to sham stimulation. No improvement occurred when frequencies mismatched. Our results provide support for the role of oscillatory reinstatement in memory retrieval.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Context", "Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)", "Memory", "Oscillation", "Reinstatement", "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Mental Recall", "Models, Neurological", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Psychomotor Performance", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031677634", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36646044100": {"Name": "Javadi A.H.", "AuthorID": "36646044100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "55832879500": {"Name": "Glen J.C.", "AuthorID": "55832879500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57196064245": {"Name": "Halkiopoulos S.", "AuthorID": "57196064245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57196063888": {"Name": "Schulz M.", "AuthorID": "57196063888", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "6603575074": {"Name": "Spiers H.J.", "AuthorID": "6603575074", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
