The latter are deposited onto the BDD electrodes surface by a physical vapor deposition process followed by de-wetting under oxygen-free atmosphere in high temperature conditions. The mean size of the particles is in the order of 10 nm, as characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image processing and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The particles are made of e.g. platinum, iridium, gold, ruthenium or alloys thereof and showed good adhesion, and good electrochemical reactivity towards a wide range of redox analytes. Sensor arrays composed of 4 BDD electrodes each modified with a different nano-catalyst were mounted and tested for various analytical applications. For instance such a sensor array was able to detect online and discriminate the presence in tap water of the following contaminants: Imidacloprid, Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) or hydrogen peroxide, chosen for demonstration purpose.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amperometric", "Diamond", "Electrodes", "Nano-catalyst", "Sensor array"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amperometric", "Boron-doped diamond electrodes", "Dimethyl methylphosphonate", "Electrochemical reactivity", "High temperature condition", "Nano-catalyst", "Physical vapor deposition process", "Scanning electron microscopy image"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027217317", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Health and Safety", "CENG", "1504"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"6603106945": {"Name": "Scorsone E.", "AuthorID": "6603106945", "AffiliationID": "60007816, 60106189", "AffiliationName": "CEA, LIST, Diamond Sensors Laboratory"}, "57191260742": {"Name": "Belghiti D.", "AuthorID": "57191260742", "AffiliationID": "60007816, 60106189", "AffiliationName": "CEA, LIST, Diamond Sensors Laboratory"}, "57190435601": {"Name": "Habchi M.", "AuthorID": "57190435601", "AffiliationID": "60007816, 60106189", "AffiliationName": "CEA, LIST, Diamond Sensors Laboratory"}, "7005744150": {"Name": "Bergonzo P.", "AuthorID": "7005744150", "AffiliationID": "60007816, 60106189", "AffiliationName": "CEA, LIST, Diamond Sensors Laboratory"}}}
