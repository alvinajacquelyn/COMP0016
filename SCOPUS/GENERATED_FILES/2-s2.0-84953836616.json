Adults with ASD apparently over-detected faux pas despite good comprehension abilities, and were generally slower at responding. Signal detection analysis demonstrated that the ASD participants had significantly greater difficulty detecting whether a cartoon depicted a faux pas and showed a liberal response bias. Test item analysis demonstrated that the ASD group were not in agreement with a reference control group (n = 69) about which non-faux pas items were most difficult. These results suggest that the participants with ASD had a primary problem with faux pas detection, but that there is another factor at work, possibly compensatory, that relates to their choice of a liberal response criterion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder", "Compensatory strategy", "Decision making", "Executive function", "Faux pas", "Open-ended", "Social cognition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Case-Control Studies", "Comprehension", "Decision Making", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Signal Detection, Psychological", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953836616", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"55911321200": {"Name": "Thi\u00e9baut F.", "AuthorID": "55911321200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56623762200": {"Name": "White S.", "AuthorID": "56623762200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56780982200": {"Name": "Walsh A.", "AuthorID": "56780982200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56781442600": {"Name": "Klargaard S.", "AuthorID": "56781442600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56780700300": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "56780700300", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7101747722": {"Name": "Burgess P.", "AuthorID": "7101747722", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
