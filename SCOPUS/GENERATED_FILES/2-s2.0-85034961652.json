Methods: The hazard ratios of cancers, metastases, and death were assessed in adults with connective tissue diseases prescribed hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine for at least 1 year in comparison with unexposed individuals with the same underlying conditions. A competing risk survival regression analysis was performed. Data were extracted from the Health Improvement Network UK primary care database. Results: Eight thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine individuals exposed to hydroxychloroquine (98.6%) or chloroquine (1.4%) and 24,118 unexposed individuals were included in the study (median age: 56 [45-66] years, women: 76.8%). When compared to the unexposed group, individuals exposed to hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine were not at lower risk of non-skin cancers (adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [sHR]: 1.04 [0.92-1.18], p=0.54), hematological malignancies (adjusted sHR: 1.00 [0.73-1.38], p=0.99), or skin cancers (adjusted sHR: 0.92 [0.78-1.07], p=0.26). The risk of metastasis was not significantly different between the two groups. However, it was significantly lower during the exposure period when compared with the unexposed (adjusted sHR: 0.64 [0.44-0.95] for the overall population and 0.61 [0.38-1.00] for those diagnosed with incident cancers). The risk of death was also significantly lower in those exposed to hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (adjusted HR: 0.90 [0.81-1.00] in the overall population and 0.78 [0.64-0.96] in those diagnosed with incident cancer). Conclusion: Individuals on long-term exposure to hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine are not at lower risk of cancer. However, hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine may lower the risk of metastatic cancer and death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimalarial drugs", "Cancer", "Connective tissue diseases", "Death"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034961652", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"56127354000": {"Name": "Fardet L.", "AuthorID": "56127354000", "AffiliationID": "60025066", "AffiliationName": "Equipe d\u2019Accueil 7379 EpiDermE, Universit\u00e9 Paris Est Cr\u00e9teil"}, "55334594200": {"Name": "Nazareth I.", "AuthorID": "55334594200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
