Sexual health services are well placed to identify and support patients experiencing domestic violence and abuse (DVA). Most sexual health professionals have had minimal DVA training despite English National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations. We sought to determine the feasibility of an evidence-based complex DVA training intervention in female sexual health walk-in services (IRIS ADViSE: Identification and Referral to Improve Safety whilst Assessing Domestic Violence in Sexual Health Environments). Methods: An adaptive mixed method pilot study in the female walk-in service of two sexual health clinics. Following implementation and evaluation at site 1, the intervention was refined before implementation at site 2. The intervention comprised electronic prompts, multidisciplinary training sessions, clinic materials and simple referral pathways to IRIS ADViSE advocate-educators (AEs). The pilot lasted 7 weeks at site 1 and 12 weeks at site 2. Feasibility outcomes were to assign a supportive DVA clinical lead, an IRIS ADViSE AE employed by a local DVA service provider, adapt electronic records, develop local referral pathways, assess whether enquiry, identification and referral rates were measurable. Results: Both sites achieved all feasibility outcomes: appointing a supportive DVA clinical lead and IRIS ADViSE AE, establishing links with a local DVA provider, adapting electronic records, developing local referral pathways and rates of enquiry, identification and referral were found to be measurable. Site 1: 10% enquiry rate (n=267), 4% identification rate (n=16) and eight AE referrals. Site 2: 61% enquiry rate (n=1090), a 7% identification rate (n=79) and eight AE referrals. Conclusions: IRIS ADViSE can be successfully developed and implemented in sexual health clinics. It fulfils the unmet need for DVA training. Longer-term evaluation is recommended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complex interventions", "Evidence based medicine", "Health serv research", "Public health", "Women"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Crime Victims", "Domestic Violence", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Male", "Pilot Projects", "Referral and Consultation", "Sexual Health", "Social Support", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Women's Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042852180", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56670957700": {"Name": "Sohal A.H.", "AuthorID": "56670957700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Yvonne Carter Building"}, "55228809500": {"Name": "Griffiths C.", "AuthorID": "55228809500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Yvonne Carter Building"}, "56364101200": {"Name": "Pathak N.", "AuthorID": "56364101200", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London, University of Bristol School of Social and Community Medicine"}, "57198250558": {"Name": "Blake S.", "AuthorID": "57198250558", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, School of Social and Community Medicine"}, "28567510600": {"Name": "Bailey J.", "AuthorID": "28567510600", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol Sexual Health Centre"}, "35309426800": {"Name": "Apea V.", "AuthorID": "35309426800", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust, Sexual Health"}, "57201008915": {"Name": "Berry J.", "AuthorID": "57201008915", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, Bristol Sexual Health Centre"}, "55749172200": {"Name": "Feder G.", "AuthorID": "55749172200", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Centre for Academic Primary Care"}}}
