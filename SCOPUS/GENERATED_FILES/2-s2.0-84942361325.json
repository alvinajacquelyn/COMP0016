We include in this approach galaxy cosmic shear and galaxy intrinsic alignments, CMB deflection, CMB temperature, and CMB polarization data; including the interdatum power spectra between all quantities. We apply this to forecasting cosmological parameter errors for CMB and imaging surveys and show that the additional covariance between the CMB and ellipticity measurements can improve dark energy equation of state measurements by 30 per cent. We present predictions for Euclid-like, Planck, ACTPoL, and CoRE-like experiments and show that the combination of cosmic shear and the CMB, from Euclid-like and CoRE-like experiments, could in principle measure the sum of neutrino masses with an error of 0.003 eV, and the dark energy equation of state with an error on w0 of less than 0.02.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmological parameters", "Gravitational lensing: weak"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942361325", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"8899520500": {"Name": "Kitching T.D.", "AuthorID": "8899520500", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "6701605678": {"Name": "Heavens A.F.", "AuthorID": "6701605678", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Centre for Inference and Cosmology, Imperial College London"}, "55365310800": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55365310800", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, Department of Physics, University of California"}}}
