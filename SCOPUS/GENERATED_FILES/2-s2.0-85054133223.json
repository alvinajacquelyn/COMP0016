All rights reserved.Gait disturbances are some of the earliest changes in dementia and their monitoring presents an opportunity for early diagnosis. The exact relationship between gait and well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be clarified. In this study we compared gait-related measures with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers of AD pathology. We recruited seventeen participants with mild AD in a multi-site study and performed gait assessment as well as lumbar punctures to obtain CSF. CSF A\u03b242/A\u03b240 and A\u03b242/A\u03b238 correlated positively with measures of variability (step time and step length) in the clinic-based assessments. This was driven by a negative relationship between gait variability and A\u03b240 and A\u03b238 but not A\u03b242.The amyloid ratios and gait variability measures were also associated with more severe functional impairment. We interpret these data as an indication that increasing amyloid production (i.e., increasing A\u03b240 and A\u03b238) is associated with diminishing cognitive-motor control of gait. These preliminary results suggest that the two amyloid ratios may be a marker of the earliest disturbances in the interplay between cognitive and motor control which characterize dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid", "biomarkers", "cerebrospinal fluid proteins", "gait"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Female", "Gait Disorders, Neurologic", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Pilot Projects", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054133223", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55970364400": {"Name": "Koychev I.", "AuthorID": "55970364400", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warnerford Hospital"}, "56356989800": {"Name": "Lawson J.", "AuthorID": "56356989800", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warnerford Hospital"}, "7005575001": {"Name": "Lovestone S.", "AuthorID": "7005575001", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warnerford Hospital"}, "25027488400": {"Name": "Galna B.", "AuthorID": "25027488400", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "57203234226": {"Name": "Thomas A.", "AuthorID": "57203234226", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "7003666082": {"Name": "Rochester L.", "AuthorID": "7003666082", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Institute for Ageing, Newcastle University"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "25423301000": {"Name": "Zamboni G.", "AuthorID": "25423301000", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurosciences and Neurotechnology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "15052214300": {"Name": "Ridha B.H.", "AuthorID": "15052214300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London"}, "15721498000": {"Name": "Rowe J.B.", "AuthorID": "15721498000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "34769841900": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "34769841900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "8086798900": {"Name": "Malhotra P.", "AuthorID": "8086798900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "7006045864": {"Name": "Ritchie C.", "AuthorID": "7006045864", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}}}
