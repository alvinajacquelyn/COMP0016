Here we use full-Sun observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, to show that when the Sun is observed as a star, the variation of coronal composition is highly correlated with a proxy for solar activity, the F10.7 cm radio flux, and therefore with the solar cycle phase. Similar cyclic variations should therefore be detectable spectroscopically in X-ray observations of solar analogs. The plasma composition in full-disk observations of the Sun is related to the evolution of coronal magnetic field activity. Our observations therefore introduce an uncertainty into the nature of any relationship between coronal composition and fixed stellar properties. The results highlight the importance of systematic full-cycle observations for understanding the elemental composition of solar-like stellar coronae.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026839578", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57220851521": {"Name": "Brooks D.H.", "AuthorID": "57220851521", "AffiliationID": "60022990", "AffiliationName": "Hinode Team, ISAS/JAXA"}, "55449579800": {"Name": "Baker D.", "AuthorID": "55449579800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7005109977": {"Name": "Van Driel-Gesztelyi L.", "AuthorID": "7005109977", "AffiliationID": "60004114", "AffiliationName": "Konkoly Observatory of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7101766628": {"Name": "Warren H.P.", "AuthorID": "7101766628", "AffiliationID": "60027271", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Division, Naval Research Laboratory"}}}
