All rights reserved.Objective(s): An HIV cure will impose aviraemia that is sustained following the withdrawal of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Understanding the efficacy of novel interventions aimed at curing HIV requires characterization of both natural viral control and the effect of ART on viral control after treatment interruption. Design: Analysis of transient viral control in recent seroconverters in the Short Pulse AntiRetroviral Therapy at Acute Seroconversion trial. Methods: We compared untreated and treated HIV seroconverters (n=292) and identified periods of control (plasma HIV RNA<400 copies/ml for \u226516 weeks off therapy) in 7.9%of ART-naive participants, and in 12.0%overall. HIVDNA was measured by qPCR, andHIV-specificCD8+ responses weremeasured by enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent spot assay (ELISpot). T-cell activation and exhaustion were measured by flow cytometry. Results: At baseline, future controllers had lower HIV DNA, lower plasma HIV RNA, higher CD4+ :CD8+ ratios (all P<0.001) and higher CD4+ cell counts (P<0.05) than noncontrollers. Among controllers, the only difference between the untreated and those who received ART was higher baseline HIV RNA in the latter (P=0.003), supporting an added ART effect. Conclusion: Consideration of spontaneous remission in untreated individuals will be critical to avoid overestimating the effect size of new interventions used in HIV cure studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "ELISpot", "HIV", "HIV DNA", "Natural history", "Post-treatment control", "T lymphocytes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "DNA, Viral", "Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA, Viral", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008417731", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7404679392": {"Name": "Martin G.E.", "AuthorID": "7404679392", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, University of Oxford"}, "57217963588": {"Name": "Gossez M.", "AuthorID": "57217963588", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, University of Oxford"}, "56026930500": {"Name": "Williams J.P.", "AuthorID": "56026930500", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, University of Oxford"}, "57086618400": {"Name": "Meyerowitz J.", "AuthorID": "57086618400", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, University of Oxford"}, "35573097200": {"Name": "Frater J.", "AuthorID": "35573097200", "AffiliationID": "60172675", "AffiliationName": "Oxford National Institute, Health Research Biomedical Research Centre"}, "8632775600": {"Name": "St\u00f6hr W.", "AuthorID": "8632775600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "43561579700": {"Name": "Leitman E.M.", "AuthorID": "43561579700", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School"}, "7003741802": {"Name": "Goulder P.", "AuthorID": "7003741802", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7202104963": {"Name": "Porter K.", "AuthorID": "7202104963", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Imperial College"}, "57201568964": {"Name": "Fidler S.", "AuthorID": "57201568964", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Wright Fleming Institute, Imperial College"}}}
