Methods: A novel chitosan derivative, O-palmitoyl chitosan (OPC) was synthesized from chitosan and palmitoyl chloride using methane-sulfonic acid as a solvent. The success of synthesis was confirmed by Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy and proton NMR spectroscopy (H-NMR). Liposomes encapsulating ferrous sulphate as a model hydrophilic drug for intestinal delivery were prepared with or without OPC inclusion (Lipo-Fe and OPC-Lipo-Fe). Results: Entrapment of iron was significantly higher in OPC containing liposomes compared to controls. Quantitative iron absorption from the OPC liposomes was significantly higher (1.5-fold P<0.05) than free ferrous sulphate controls. Qualitative uptake analysis by confocal imaging using coumarin-6 dye loaded liposomes also indicated higher cellular uptake and internalization of the OPC-containing liposomes. Conclusion: These findings suggest that addition of OPC during liposome preparation creates robust vesicles that have improved mucoadhesive and absorption enhancing properties. The chitosan derivative OPC therefore provides a novel alternative for formulation of delivery vehicles targeting intestinal absorption.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caco-2", "Ferrous sulfate", "Gut delivery", "Intestinal absorption"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caco-2 Cells", "Calorimetry, Differential Scanning", "Cell Survival", "Chitosan", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions", "Intestines", "Iron", "Liposomes", "Nanoparticles", "Particle Size", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared", "X-Ray Diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054779817", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"18042756100": {"Name": "Zariwala M.G.", "AuthorID": "18042756100", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}, "57204165180": {"Name": "Bendre H.", "AuthorID": "57204165180", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "57212938394": {"Name": "Taylor K.M.G.", "AuthorID": "57212938394", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "8774245700": {"Name": "Somavarapu S.", "AuthorID": "8774245700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "18434395100": {"Name": "Markiv A.", "AuthorID": "18434395100", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "6506183364": {"Name": "Farnaud S.", "AuthorID": "6506183364", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University"}, "7006973445": {"Name": "Renshaw D.", "AuthorID": "7006973445", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University"}}}
