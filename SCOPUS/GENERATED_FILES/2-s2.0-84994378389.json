The synthesis was carried out via aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition using Al(acac)3 and methanol. The films were analyzed using XRD, SEM, UV-vis spectroscopy and XPS. The coatings were highly crystalline (when annealed) with low carbon contamination levels and a relatively featureless morphology that gave rise to ultra high transparency in the UV, visible and near IR portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Electromagnetic spectra", "Facile synthesis", "Low carbon", "Material characterizations", "Quartz substrate", "Ultra-high", "UV-vis spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994378389", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"55681972200": {"Name": "Ponja S.", "AuthorID": "55681972200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
