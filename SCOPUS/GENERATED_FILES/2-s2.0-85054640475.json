We use a high spatial and temporal resolution power system optimisation model to explore the conditions that lead to the deployment of floating offshore wind and the effect this has on the rest of the electricity system for Great Britain in 2050. We perform a sensitivity analysis on three dimensions: total share of renewables, floating offshore costs and the impact of waves on operation. We find that all three impact the deployment of floating offshore wind energy. A clear competition between floating offshore wind and conventional offshore wind is demonstrated, with less impact on other renewable sources. It is shown that floating wind is used to provide access to greater spatial diversification. Further, access to more distant regions also affects the optimal placement of conventional offshore wind, as spatial diversification is spread between floating and bottom-mounted sites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cost optimisation", "Electricity system model", "Multiregional", "Offshore wind", "Spatial diversification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost optimisation", "Electricity system", "Multiregional", "Offshore winds", "Spatial diversification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054640475", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"]], "AuthorData": {"57199362437": {"Name": "Moore A.", "AuthorID": "57199362437", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Energy Institute"}, "57198904204": {"Name": "Price J.", "AuthorID": "57198904204", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Energy Institute"}, "55368951400": {"Name": "Zeyringer M.", "AuthorID": "55368951400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Energy Institute"}}}
