In the current study, we explored the potential of pretreatment pregenual anterior cingulate cortex activity as a putative biomarker of treatment response. Methods: Thirty-Two medication-free patients with depression were treated for 6 weeks with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, escitalopram. Before treatment began, patients underwent an fMRI scan testing response to brief, masked, presentations of facial expression depicting sadness and happiness. Results: After 6 weeks of treatment, there were 20 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor responders and 12 nonresponders. Increased pretreatment pregenual anterior cingulate cortex activity to sad vs happy faces was observed in responders relative to nonresponders. A leave-one-out analysis suggested that activity in the anterior cingulate cortex was able to predict response status at the level of the individual participant. Conclusions: The study supports the notion of pregenual anterior cingulate cortex as a promising predictor of antidepressant response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anterior cingulate cortex", "Depression", "Functional magnetic resonance imaging", "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors", "Treatment response prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antidepressive Agents", "Citalopram", "Depression", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Facial Recognition", "Female", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prognosis", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055824193", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6602633137": {"Name": "Godlewska B.R.", "AuthorID": "6602633137", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology Research Unit, University Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7102968214": {"Name": "Browning M.", "AuthorID": "7102968214", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60116889", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Warneford Hospital"}, "6507268816": {"Name": "Norbury R.", "AuthorID": "6507268816", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Computational Psychiatry Lab, University Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "55062399500": {"Name": "Igoumenou A.", "AuthorID": "55062399500", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Whitelands College, University of Roehampton"}, "26643348200": {"Name": "Cowen P.J.", "AuthorID": "26643348200", "AffiliationID": "60099553", "AffiliationName": "Barnet Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust"}, "7005566211": {"Name": "Harmer C.J.", "AuthorID": "7005566211", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Emotion Research Laboratory, University Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}}}
