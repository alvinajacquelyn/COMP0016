Especially, conventional organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells (HSCs) based on PTB7 as p-type semiconductor can only utilize 400-800 nm solar spectrum. One effective strategy to overcome this obstacle is the introduction of upconversion nanophosphors (NPs), in the virtue of utilizing the near infrared region (NIR) of solar radiation. Up-conversion can convert low-energy photons to high-energy ones through multi-photon processes, by which the solar spectrum is tailored to well match the absorptive domain of the absorber. Herein we incorporate erbium-ytterbium co-doped gadolinium molybdate (Gd2(MoO4)3, GMO), denoted as GMO:Yb/Er, into TiO2 acceptor film in HSCs to enhance the light harvest. Here Er3+ acts as activator while Yb-MoO4 2- is the joint sensitizer. Facts proved that the GMO:Yb/Er single crystal NPs are capable of turning NIR photons to visible photons that can be easily captured by PTB7. Studies on time-resolved photoluminescence demonstrate that electron transfer rate at the interface increases sharply from 0.65 to 1.42 \u00d7 109 s-1. As a result, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of the GMO:Yb/Er doped TiO2/PTB7 HSCs reach 3.67%, which is increased by around 25% compared to their neat PTB7/TiO2 counterparts (2.94%). This work may open a hopeful way to take the advantage of those conversional rare-earth ion doped oxides that function in tailoring solar light spectrum for optoelectronic applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electron transfer rates", "Erbium-ytterbium co-doped", "Optoelectronic applications", "Organic/Inorganic hybrids", "Photo-electric conversion efficiency", "Solar light spectrum", "Time-resolved photoluminescence", "Upconversion nanophosphors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989208790", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57208453092": {"Name": "Jin X.", "AuthorID": "57208453092", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "57191365305": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57191365305", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "57208840068": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "57208840068", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "57198719025": {"Name": "Li F.", "AuthorID": "57198719025", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "56157911800": {"Name": "Li Q.", "AuthorID": "56157911800", "AffiliationID": "60083519", "AffiliationName": "Jiangxi Engineering Laboratory for Optoelectronics Testing Technology, Nanchang Hangkong University"}, "14619181500": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "14619181500", "AffiliationID": "60073739", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lingnan Normal University"}, "55600876400": {"Name": "Sun W.", "AuthorID": "55600876400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "56205971300": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "56205971300", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, University of New South Wales"}}}
