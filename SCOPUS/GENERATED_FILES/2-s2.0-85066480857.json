In this research a series of experimental model tests of embankments reinforced with Geocell and tires were conducted to compare the performance of these types of reinforcement. The models tested had different Geocell embedment depths, number of Geocell layers, vertical spacing between Geocell layers and density or soil stiffness. Testing consisted of applying pressure at the crest of the embankment and monitoring the pressure distribution, as well as the vertical and horizontal deformations inside of the embankment. The results suggested that when compared with unreinforced embankments, reinforced embankments effectively improve the bearing capacity, thereby, reducing vertical and lateral displacements. This study also showed that an optimal embedment depth and spacing between Geocell reinforcement layers can further improve the slope performance. Comparisons between Geocell reinforced embankments and waste tire reinforced embankments, showed that waste tire reinforcement has a superior performance over the Geocell-reinforced embankments. This difference in performance between the two types of reinforcement is more apparent if the embankment backfill has lower stiffness. i.e. lower density.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bearing capacity", "Geocell", "Geosynthetics", "Model test", "Settlement", "Soil reinforcement", "Stress", "Waste tires"], "IndexKeywords": ["Geocells", "Geosynthetics", "Model tests", "Settlement", "Soil reinforcement", "Waste tires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066480857", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"7501447027": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "7501447027", "AffiliationID": "60108756", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, Architecture and Environment, Hubei University of Technology"}, "57194068379": {"Name": "Cui F.", "AuthorID": "57194068379", "AffiliationID": "60032389", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Transportation Engineering, Hebei University of Technology"}, "7401565435": {"Name": "Xiao H.", "AuthorID": "7401565435", "AffiliationID": "60108756", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, Architecture and Environment, Hubei University of Technology"}, "57200769511": {"Name": "Ferreira P.", "AuthorID": "57200769511", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering - University College London \u2013 UCL"}, "57209108083": {"Name": "Jie H.", "AuthorID": "57209108083", "AffiliationID": "60003212", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio"}}}
