To determine how resistance to MDM2/p53 binding antagonists might develop, SJSA-1 and NGP cells were exposed to growth inhibitory concentrations of chemically distinct MDM2 inhibitors, Nutlin-3 and MI-63, and clonal resistant cell lines generated. The p53 mediated responses of parental and resistant cell lines were compared. In contrast to the parental cell lines, p53 activation by Nutlin-3, MI-63 or ionizing radiation was not observed in either the SJSA-1 or the NGP derived cell lines. An identical TP53 mutation was subsequently identified in both of the SJSA-1 resistant lines, whilst one out of three identified mutations was common to both NGP derived lines. Mutation specific PCR revealed these mutations were present in parental SJSA-1 and NGP cell populations at a low frequency. Despite cross-resistance to a broad panel of MDM2/p53 binding antagonists, these MDM2-amplified and TP53 mutant cell lines remained sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR). These results indicate that MDM2/ p53 binding antagonists will select for p53 mutations present in tumours at a low frequency at diagnosis, leading to resistance, but such tumours may nevertheless remain responsive to alternative therapies, including IR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MDM2 inhibitor", "MDM2-amplification", "MI-63", "Nutlin-3", "Resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Humans", "Mutation", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979910691", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"18039854100": {"Name": "Drummond C.J.", "AuthorID": "18039854100", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "57188958306": {"Name": "Esfandiari A.", "AuthorID": "57188958306", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "40561337200": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "40561337200", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "57211105400": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "57211105400", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "7005571687": {"Name": "Hutton C.", "AuthorID": "7005571687", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "55465648600": {"Name": "Jackson J.", "AuthorID": "55465648600", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "56615229800": {"Name": "Bennaceur K.", "AuthorID": "56615229800", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "40561973300": {"Name": "Xu Q.", "AuthorID": "40561973300", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "57190427337": {"Name": "Makimanejavali A.R.", "AuthorID": "57190427337", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "7201550538": {"Name": "Newell D.R.", "AuthorID": "7201550538", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "7003490471": {"Name": "Hardcastle I.R.", "AuthorID": "7003490471", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "7401911020": {"Name": "Griffin R.J.", "AuthorID": "7401911020", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "7005709885": {"Name": "Lunec J.", "AuthorID": "7005709885", "AffiliationID": "60159968, 60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Cancer Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Medical School, Newcastle University"}, "22984763200": {"Name": "Del Bello F.", "AuthorID": "22984763200", "AffiliationID": "60026298", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry Unit, School of Pharmacy, University of Camerino"}, "6604017374": {"Name": "Piergentili A.", "AuthorID": "6604017374", "AffiliationID": "60026298", "AffiliationName": "Medicinal Chemistry Unit, School of Pharmacy, University of Camerino"}}}
