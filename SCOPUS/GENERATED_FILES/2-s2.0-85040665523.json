Pd nanoparticles were produced using a reverse micelle method resulting in particles with a remarkably small particle size distribution (\u03c3 < < 1 nm). The support type and particle size were observed to affect both catalytic activity and product selectivity. All catalysts showed a decrease of their activity with time on stream, paired with an increase in selectivity to butenes (1-butene and cis/trans-2-butene) from a product stream initially dominated by n-butane. In situ XAFS demonstrated a correlation between the formation of palladium hydride and n-butane production in the early stages (~ 1 h) of reaction. The extent of palladium hydride formation, as well as its depletion with time on stream, was dependent on both particle size and support type. Metallic Pd was identified as the species selective towards the production of butenes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Butadiene", "Hydrogenation", "Palladium", "Particle size"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hydrogenation of 1 ,3 butadienes", "Palladium hydride", "PD nano particle", "Product selectivities", "Product streams", "Reverse-micelle method", "Small particle size", "Time on streams"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040665523", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57194760959": {"Name": "Decarolis D.", "AuthorID": "57194760959", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Research Complex at Harwell"}, "16401902100": {"Name": "Lezcano-Gonzalez I.", "AuthorID": "16401902100", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Research Complex at Harwell"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Research Complex at Harwell"}, "35271498800": {"Name": "Gianolio D.", "AuthorID": "35271498800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd"}}}
