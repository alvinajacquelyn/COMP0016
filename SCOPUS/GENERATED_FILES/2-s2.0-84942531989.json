However real-world scenes often contain limited texture information, repeated elements and other ambiguities which remain challenging for fully automatic algorithms. This paper presents a technique that combines intuitive user constraints with dense multi-view stereo reconstruction. By providing annotations in the form of simple paint strokes, a user can guide a multi-view stereo algorithm and avoid common failure cases. We show how smoothness, discontinuity and depth ordering constraints can be incorporated directly into a variational optimization framework for multi-view stereo. Our method avoids the need for heuristic approaches that edit a depth-map in a sequential process, and avoids requiring the user to accurately segment object boundaries or to directly model geometry. We show how with a small amount of intuitive input, a user may create improved depth maps in challenging cases for multi-view-stereo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic algorithms", "Depth reconstruction", "Heuristic approach", "Image based rendering applications", "Multi-view stereo reconstruction", "Ordering constraints", "Texture information", "Variational optimization"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942531989", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"56875453300": {"Name": "Doro Y.", "AuthorID": "56875453300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57213952541": {"Name": "Campbell N.", "AuthorID": "57213952541", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006458237": {"Name": "Kautz J.", "AuthorID": "7006458237", "AffiliationID": "60076695", "AffiliationName": "NVIDIA Research"}, "8575485400": {"Name": "Starck J.", "AuthorID": "8575485400", "AffiliationID": "100432411", "AffiliationName": "The Foundry"}}}
