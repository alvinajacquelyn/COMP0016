We made use of (sub-)mm data obtained in the framework of the Chemical HErschel Surveys of Star forming regions and Astrochemical Surveys at IRAM (ASAI) key science programs. We detected 12C32S, 12C34S, 13C32S, and 12C33S emissions, for a total of 18 transitions, with Eu up to ~180 K. The unprecedented sensitivity of the survey allows us to carefully analyse the line profiles, revealing high-velocity emission, up to 20 km s-1 with respect to the systemic. The profiles can be well fitted by a combination of two exponential laws that are remarkably similar to what previously found using CO. These components have been related to the cavity walls produced by the ~2000 yr B1 shock and the older (~4000 yr) B2 shock, respectively. The combination of low- and high-excitation CS emission was used to properly sample the different physical components expected in a shocked region. Our CS observations show that this molecule is highlighting the dense, nH2 = 1-5 \u00d7 105 cm-3, cavity walls produced by the episodic outflow in L1157. In addition, the highest excitation (Eu \u2265 130 K) CS lines provide us with the signature of denser (1-5 \u00d7 106 cm-3) gas, associated with a molecular reformation zone of a dissociative J-type shock, which is expected to arise where the precessing jet impacting the molecular cavities. The CS fractional abundance increases up to ~10-7 in all the kinematical components. This value is consistent with what previously found for prototypical protostars and it is in agreement with the prediction of the abundances obtained via the chemical code Astrochem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ISM: molecules", "Molecular data", "Radio lines: ISM", "Stars: formation", "Submillimetre: ISM"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939529318", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55213043500": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Ruiz A.I.", "AuthorID": "55213043500", "AffiliationID": "60030699", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00ed,sica, \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f2nica (INAOE)"}, "7003627088": {"Name": "Codella C.", "AuthorID": "7003627088", "AffiliationID": "60021729, 60030106", "AffiliationName": "INAF, Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri"}, "8911634600": {"Name": "Podio L.", "AuthorID": "8911634600", "AffiliationID": "60021729, 60030106", "AffiliationName": "INAF, Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri"}, "55917808700": {"Name": "Lefloch B.", "AuthorID": "55917808700", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, IPAG"}, "7006003488": {"Name": "Ceccarelli C.", "AuthorID": "7006003488", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, IPAG"}, "55910018900": {"Name": "Benedettini M.", "AuthorID": "55910018900", "AffiliationID": "60030106", "AffiliationName": "INAF, Istituto di Astrofisica e Planetologia Spaziali"}, "23484206600": {"Name": "Busquet G.", "AuthorID": "23484206600", "AffiliationID": "60021557, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Andaluc\u00eda, CSIC"}, "8976944900": {"Name": "Nisini B.", "AuthorID": "8976944900", "AffiliationID": "60024986, 60030106", "AffiliationName": "INAF, Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma"}, "7003564783": {"Name": "Viti S.", "AuthorID": "7003564783", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
