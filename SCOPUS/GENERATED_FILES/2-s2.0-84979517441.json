Such materials are of great industrial importance in modern materials chemistry. In particular, there is a focus on the search for alternatives to indium-based materials, prompted by indium's problematic supply risk as well as a number of functional factors. The important relationship between computational study and experimental observation is explored, and an extensive comparison is made between the electrical properties of a number of the most interesting experimentally-prepared materials. In writing this article, we aim to provide both an accessible tutorial of the physical descriptions of transparent conducting oxides, and an up-to-date overview of the field, with a brief history, some key accomplishments from the past few decades, the current state of the field as well as postulation on some likely future developments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binary oxides", "Computational studies", "General formulas", "Materials chemistry", "Oxide materials", "Supply risk", "Transparent conducting oxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979517441", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57188638209": {"Name": "Dixon S.", "AuthorID": "57188638209", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, Diamond Light Source Ltd."}}}
