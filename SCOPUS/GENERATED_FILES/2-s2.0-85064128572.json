Co-precipitation is the most ubiquitous method for forming iron oxide nanoparticles. For a typical co-precipitation synthesis, the pH of a ferrous and/or ferric ion solution is increased via the addition of a base. The latter can be added either slowly (a steady addition over either minutes or hours) or fast (a one-time addition) resulting in an abrupt increase in the pH. However, understanding the mechanism of particle formation is still lacking, which limits the reproducibility of the co-precipitation reaction due to intermediate phases still being present in the final product. In this work, we study in detail a co-precipitation synthesis with an abrupt increase in pH via the addition of sodium carbonate. Fast and reproducible mixing at defined precursor and base solution temperatures was achieved utilising a flow reactor. Transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction and room temperature 57 Fe M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy showed a distinct transition from an amorphous ferrihydrite phase to a mixture of magnetite-maghemite (Fe 3 O 4 /\u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 ). Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed the initial formation of crystalline iron hydroxide carbonate (green rust) plates occurring before the Fe 3 O 4 /\u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 appeared. The ferrihydrite particles increase in size over time as the proportion of iron hydroxide carbonate plates are re-dissolved into solution, until the ferrihydrite particles crystallise into Fe 3 O 4 /\u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 .", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coprecipitation synthesis", "Ferrihydrite phase", "Intermediate phasis", "Iron oxide nanoparticle", "Particle formations", "Reproducibilities", "Ssbauer spectroscopies", "Synchrotron x ray diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064128572", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"54897621300": {"Name": "Lagrow A.", "AuthorID": "54897621300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57189710420": {"Name": "Sergides A.", "AuthorID": "57189710420", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005152034": {"Name": "Thanh N.", "AuthorID": "7005152034", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55372475000": {"Name": "Besenhard M.", "AuthorID": "55372475000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "22934401100": {"Name": "Hodzic A.", "AuthorID": "22934401100", "AffiliationID": "122403452", "AffiliationName": "Central European Research Infrastructure Consortium, CERIC-ERIC"}, "23468740200": {"Name": "Bogart L.", "AuthorID": "23468740200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratories, University College London"}}}
