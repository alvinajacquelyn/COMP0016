A promising approach to minimize the effect of multipath interference and aid NLOS detection is vector tracking. Therefore, the objective of this research was to assess vector tracking in a dense urban environment to determine its effect on multipath interference and NLOS reception. Here, a vector delay lock loop is implemented using an adaptive extended Kalman filter. This replaces the individual code-tracking loops and navigation filter, but retains conventional carrier frequency tracking. The positioning and tracking performance of the conventional and vector-tracking implementations with and without a strobe correlator are compared using intermediate frequency signals recorded in the Koto-Ku district of urban canyon Tokyo city environment. Both static and dynamic tests were performed. It is shown that vector tracking reduces the root-mean-square positioning error by about 30 % compared with an equivalent conventional receiver in urban environments and is capable of detecting long-delay NLOS reception for a GPS receiver without any external aiding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multipath mitigation", "Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) detection", "Strobe correlator", "Urban canyon", "Vector delay lock loop (VDLL)", "Vector tracking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Multi-path mitigation", "Nonline of sight", "Strobe correlators", "Urban canyons", "Vector delay lock loops", "Vector tracking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925289338", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"35219760300": {"Name": "Hsu L.T.", "AuthorID": "35219760300", "AffiliationID": "60014982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, National Cheng Kung University"}, "9241487400": {"Name": "Jan S.S.", "AuthorID": "9241487400", "AffiliationID": "60014982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, National Cheng Kung University"}, "8872091700": {"Name": "Groves P.D.", "AuthorID": "8872091700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University College London"}, "7102513100": {"Name": "Kubo N.", "AuthorID": "7102513100", "AffiliationID": "60018357", "AffiliationName": "Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology"}}}
