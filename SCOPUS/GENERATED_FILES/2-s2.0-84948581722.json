In the two years since the previous version, 34 new gene defects are reported in this updated version. For each disorder, the key clinical and laboratory features are provided. In this new version we continue to see the increasing overlap between immunodeficiency, as manifested by infection and/or malignancy, and immune dysregulation, as manifested by auto-inflammation, auto-immunity, and/or allergy. There is also an increased number of genetic defects that lead to susceptibility to specific organisms which reflects the finely tuned nature of immune defense systems. This classification is the most up to date catalogue of all known and published primary immunodeficiencies and acts as a current reference of the knowledge of these conditions and is an important aid for the genetic and molecular diagnosis of patients with these rare diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["classification", "genetic defects", "Primary immunodeficiencies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autoimmune Diseases", "Carcinogenesis", "Consensus Development Conferences as Topic", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Expert Testimony", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Immunity", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Infection", "International Cooperation", "Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948581722", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7101616884": {"Name": "Picard C.", "AuthorID": "7101616884", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Centre d\u2019\u00e9tude des d\u00e9ficits immunitaires (CEDI), H\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades, AP-HP"}, "7201863327": {"Name": "Casanova J.L.", "AuthorID": "7201863327", "AffiliationID": "60026877", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Hematology & Immunology Unit, Necker Hospital for Sick Children"}, "6507453612": {"Name": "Al-Herz W.", "AuthorID": "6507453612", "AffiliationID": "60045463", "AffiliationName": "Allergy and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Al-Sabah Hospital"}, "6602863520": {"Name": "Bousfiha A.", "AuthorID": "6602863520", "AffiliationID": "60025457, 60019926", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Immunology Unit, Casablanca Children\u2019s Hospital, Ibn Rochd Medical School, King Hassan II University"}, "56600050500": {"Name": "Conley M.E.", "AuthorID": "56600050500", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "St. Giles Laboratory of Human Genetics of Infectious Diseases, Rockefeller Branch, The Rockefeller University"}, "7004519366": {"Name": "Chatila T.", "AuthorID": "7004519366", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, Children\u2019s Hospital Boston"}, "7005881761": {"Name": "Cunningham-Rundles C.", "AuthorID": "7005881761", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Pediatrics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine"}, "7102887023": {"Name": "Etzioni A.", "AuthorID": "7102887023", "AffiliationID": "60022403", "AffiliationName": "Meyer Children\u2019s Hospital-Technion"}, "7201492425": {"Name": "Holland S.M.", "AuthorID": "7201492425", "AffiliationID": "60017336", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"}, "26642986500": {"Name": "Klein C.", "AuthorID": "26642986500", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Dr von Hauner Children\u2019s Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "7006906788": {"Name": "Nonoyama S.", "AuthorID": "7006906788", "AffiliationID": "60019916", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, National Defense Medical College"}, "7202761181": {"Name": "Ochs H.D.", "AuthorID": "7202761181", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington and Seattle Children\u2019s Research Institute"}, "57203057185": {"Name": "Oksenhendler E.", "AuthorID": "57203057185", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "7006376169": {"Name": "Puck J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006376169", "AffiliationID": "60023691, 60033399", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco and UCSF Benioff Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7402381137": {"Name": "Sullivan K.E.", "AuthorID": "7402381137", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Division of Allergy Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia"}, "7401973909": {"Name": "Tang M.L.K.", "AuthorID": "7401973909", "AffiliationID": "60026489", "AffiliationName": "Department of Allergy and Immunology, Royal Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "25027548100": {"Name": "Franco J.L.", "AuthorID": "25027548100", "AffiliationID": "60055833", "AffiliationName": "Group of Primary Immunodeficiencies, University of Antioquia"}, "7003891382": {"Name": "Gaspar H.B.", "AuthorID": "7003891382", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
