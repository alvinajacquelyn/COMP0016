MDL is a modular, declarative language with block structures that allows users to abstract data, processes and mathematical models from auxiliary code, and hence, improves model readability, reusability and opportunities for collaborative research. The main aim of this DSL is interoperability between core software tools used in pharmacometrics. We describe the MDL-IDE, an integrated development environment for MDL, which assists users in writing MDL code. The paper focuses on language constructs and design decisions, briefly explains how models are validated and converted to a machine-readable format for processing by existing model simulation and estimation software tools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domain-specific language", "Model-based drug development", "Modeling", "Pharmacokinetics", "Simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collaborative research", "Declarative Languages", "Description languages", "Domain specific languages", "Drug development", "Integrated development environment", "Machine-readable format", "Simulation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954096385", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"22733910700": {"Name": "Kokash N.", "AuthorID": "22733910700", "AffiliationID": "100333371", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science"}, "56238715400": {"Name": "Moodie S.", "AuthorID": "56238715400", "AffiliationID": "112492470", "AffiliationName": "Eight Pillars Ltd."}, "55698396000": {"Name": "Smith M.", "AuthorID": "55698396000", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Global Clinical Pharmacology, Pfizer"}, "7006303755": {"Name": "Holford N.", "AuthorID": "7006303755", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University"}}}
