Our purpose was to study changes in pattern onset VEP with age to determine when the illustrated ISCEV standard onset VEP waveform can be reliably recorded. Methods: We recorded pattern onset VEPs from an Oz electrode referred to mid-frontal electrode according to ISCEV standards by presenting checks of 60\u2032 and 15\u2032 side length in a 15\u00b0 field. Twenty-four adults aged 20\u201363 years participated. Amplitudes and latencies were collated. Pattern onset adult VEP shapes were compared to the waveform published in the ISCEV VEP standard and to paediatric pattern onset VEP waveforms recorded from 16 infants aged 7 months. Results: The shape of the pattern onset VEP changed gradually with age. The C1\u2013C2\u2013C3 morphology of the ISCEV standard pattern onset VEP becomes apparent consistently after 40 years to 60\u2032 check stimulation. As age increases a negative trough, C2 is more frequently seen; however, the broad positive peak which characterises infant onset VEPs may still be recorded at 20 years. The group median measurements of onset VEPs to 60\u2032 were C1 7 \u00b5V@ 88 ms (range 67\u2013110 ms), C2 9 \u00b5V@109 ms (range 89\u2013158 ms) and C3 13 \u00b5V@121\u2013246 ms. To smaller 15\u2032 checks, peak latencies were earlier and C2 became more obvious. The group median measures of onset VEPs to 15\u2032 were C1 2 \u00b5V@69 ms (55\u2013108 ms), C2 10 \u00b5V@90 ms (77\u2013145 ms) and C3 14 \u00b5V@122 ms (99\u2013200 ms). Conclusion: The ISCEV standard onset VEP best describes the waveform configuration and latency of the onset VEP produced by 60\u2032 checks in adults of more than 40 years of age. The onset VEP waveform produced by 15\u2032 checks is distinguished by more prominent negative C2 and earlier C1 and C2 latencies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age", "Check size", "ISCEV standard VEP waveform", "Pattern onset VEP", "Waveform maturation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Electrophysiology", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Ophthalmology", "Retrospective Studies", "Societies, Medical", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020738722", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"7404935216": {"Name": "Thompson D.A.", "AuthorID": "7404935216", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57194547227": {"Name": "Fritsch D.M.", "AuthorID": "57194547227", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "14066258000": {"Name": "Hardy S.E.", "AuthorID": "14066258000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "The Tony Kriss Visual Electrophysiology Unit, Clinical and Academic Department of Ophthalmology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
