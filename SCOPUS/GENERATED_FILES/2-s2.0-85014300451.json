A portable, reconfigurable, multichannel amperometric data-acquisition board has been designed and fabricated, dedicated to the measurement of current-input signals delivered by the PCB-based biosensor. The electronic read-out circuit is able to provide constant biasing voltages to the amperometric sensor, measure in real-time the sensor's output currents, digitise them using high-accuracy Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and send the binary data to the user either through a USB2.0 interface or via an on-board TFT touch-screen. In order to validate the robustness and accuracy of the combined system, proof-of-concept amperometric experiments have taken place using our custom-made PCB-based system and standard electrochemical substrates. The results obtained have been cross-validated by means of standard colorimetric analysis and their differences have been highlighted and analyzed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amperometry", "Analog-to-Digital Conversion", "Data Acquisition", "Electrochemical Assay", "ELISA", "PCB-Based Sensor", "Point-Of-Care Diagnostics", "TMB"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amperometry", "Electrochemical assays", "ELISA", "PCB-based", "Point of care diagnostic"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014300451", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55357565700": {"Name": "Papadimitriou K.", "AuthorID": "55357565700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics and Nanotechnology Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science University of Southampton"}, "57193087066": {"Name": "Evans D.", "AuthorID": "57193087066", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics and Nanotechnology Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science University of Southampton"}, "7202309049": {"Name": "Morgan H.", "AuthorID": "7202309049", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics and Nanotechnology Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science University of Southampton"}, "15766131500": {"Name": "Prodromakis T.", "AuthorID": "15766131500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectronics and Nanotechnology Research Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science University of Southampton"}}}
