Previous studies have predominantly built on structured observation measures and predefined coding categories to measure children's responsiveness to gestures. However, how these gestures are designed and what detailed interactional work they can accomplish have received less attention. In this paper, we use a multimodal approach to conversation analysis (CA) to investigate how educators design their use of pointing in interactions involving school-aged children with ASD or autistic features. The analysis shows that pointing had specific sequential implications for the children beyond mere attention sharing. Occasionally, the co-occurring talk and pointing led to ambiguities when a child was interpreting their interactional connotations, specifically when the pointing gesture lacked salience. The study demonstrates that the CA approach can increase understanding of how to facilitate the establishment of joint attention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder", "Conversation analysis", "Joint attention", "Pointing gestures"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999027846", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57189383390": {"Name": "Dindar K.", "AuthorID": "57189383390", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu Campus, School of Educational Sciences and Psychology"}, "6602074945": {"Name": "Laitila A.", "AuthorID": "6602074945", "AffiliationID": "60032398", "AffiliationName": "University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Department of Psychology"}, "36185272600": {"Name": "K\u00e4rn\u00e4 E.", "AuthorID": "36185272600", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu Campus, School of Educational Sciences and Psychology"}, "55631959200": {"Name": "Korkiakangas T.", "AuthorID": "55631959200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, UCL Institute of Education, UCL Knowledge Lab"}}}
