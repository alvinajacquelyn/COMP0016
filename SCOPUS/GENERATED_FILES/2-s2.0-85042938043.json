Whilst an \u2018unlikely\u2019 outcome is not expected to occur, an \u2018unlikely\u2019 outcome will still occur one in five times (based on a translation of 20%), according to a frequentist perspective. When an \u2018unlikely\u2019 outcome does occur, the prediction may be deemed \u2018erroneous\u2019, reflecting a misunderstanding of the nature of uncertainty. Such misunderstandings could have ramifications for the subsequent (perceived) credibility of the communicator who made such a prediction. We examine whether the effect of \u2018erroneous\u2019 predictions on perceived credibility differs according to the communication format used. Specifically, we consider verbal, numerical (point and range [wide/narrow]) and mixed format probability expressions. We consistently find that subsequent perceptions are least affected by the \u2018erroneous\u2019 prediction when it is expressed numerically, regardless of whether it is a point or range estimate. Our findings suggest numbers should be used in consequential risk communications regarding \u2018unlikely\u2019 events, wherever possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["credibility", "expertise", "numerical probabilities", "risk communication", "trust", "Verbal probability expressions"], "IndexKeywords": ["credibility", "expertise", "Numerical probabilities", "Probability expressions", "Risk communication", "trust"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042938043", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"57200312363": {"Name": "Jenkins S.", "AuthorID": "57200312363", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "25649406700": {"Name": "Harris A.", "AuthorID": "25649406700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "56858413600": {"Name": "Lark R.", "AuthorID": "56858413600", "AffiliationID": "60022706", "AffiliationName": "British Geological Survey (BGS), Environmental Science Centre"}}}
