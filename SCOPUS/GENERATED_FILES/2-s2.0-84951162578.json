We report on an exploratory study that extends the current understanding of email usage by investigating how different professions at a university manage work and personal emails using different devices and how this impacts their work-home boundary management. Our findings lead us to identify two user groups: Those with permeable boundaries (primarily academics) and those who have more rigid ones (primarily professional services employees) and that there are differences in when, where and how they manage their work and personal emails. In particular we find that some participants use micro-boundary strategies to manage transitions between work and personal life. Based on these novel findings we propose improvements of email software design to facilitate effective email, work-home boundary management, and micro-boundary practices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary management", "Crossdevice interaction", "Email", "Email overload", "Work and personal email", "Work-home interference"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-device interactions", "E-mail overload", "Exploratory studies", "Flexible working", "Management practices", "Personal lives", "Professional services", "User groups"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951162578", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55851220100": {"Name": "Cecchinato M.", "AuthorID": "55851220100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "57209025408": {"Name": "Bird J.", "AuthorID": "57209025408", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "HCID Research Centre, City University London"}}}
