Design: We pooled individual patient data from these trials. The primary objective was overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Prognostic factors were also analysed. Results: A total of 269 patients were included. Of these, 91.1% completed NACT, 88.1% completed CRT and 240 (89.2%) underwent curative surgery (R0/R1). After a median follow-up of 71.9 months, 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and OS were 66.4% and 73.3%, respectively. In the group of R0/R1 resection patients, 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS were 71.6% and 77.2%, respectively, with local recurrence occurring in 5.5% and distant metastases in 20.6% of cases. Significant prognostic factors after multivariate analyses included age, tumour grade and MRI extramural venous invasion (mrEMVI) at baseline, MRI tumour regression grade (mrTRG) after CRT, ypT stage after surgery and adherence to study treatment. mrTRG after NACT was associated with PFS (P = 0.002) and OS (P = 0.018) and appeared to stratify patients based on the incremental benefit from sequential CRT. Among the outcome measures considered, in the subgroup of R0/R1 resection patients, ypT and ypStage had the highest predictive accuracy for RFS (concordance index: 0.6238 and 0.6252, respectively) and OS (concordance index: 0.6094 and 0.6132, respectively). Conclusions: Administering NACT before CRT could be a potential strategy for high-risk LARC. In this setting, mrTRG after CRT is an independent prognostic factor, while mrTRG after NACT should be tested as a parameter for treatment selection in trials of NACT \u00b1 CRT. ypT stage may be a valuable surrogate end point for future phase II trials investigating intensified neoadjuvant treatments in similar patient populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemoradiotherapy", "Locally advanced rectal cancer", "MR tumour regression grade", "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy", "Pooled analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Rectal Neoplasms", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984941797", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"36156841100": {"Name": "Sclafani F.", "AuthorID": "36156841100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36071300500": {"Name": "Cunningham D.", "AuthorID": "36071300500", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005590139": {"Name": "Tait D.", "AuthorID": "7005590139", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37067861400": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "37067861400", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56712453100": {"Name": "Begum R.", "AuthorID": "56712453100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101977547": {"Name": "Oates J.", "AuthorID": "7101977547", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "14526721100": {"Name": "Chau I.", "AuthorID": "14526721100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8772573900": {"Name": "Brown G.", "AuthorID": "8772573900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55847664900": {"Name": "Evans J.", "AuthorID": "55847664900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55891277600": {"Name": "Yu S.", "AuthorID": "55891277600", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005624882": {"Name": "Wotherspoon A.", "AuthorID": "7005624882", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56401065500": {"Name": "Sena Teixeira Mendes L.", "AuthorID": "56401065500", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8519296500": {"Name": "Peckitt C.", "AuthorID": "8519296500", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research and Development, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "34572914800": {"Name": "Tabernero J.", "AuthorID": "34572914800", "AffiliationID": "60012486, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "56457740000": {"Name": "Glimelius B.", "AuthorID": "56457740000", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Section of Experimental and Clinical Oncology, University of Uppsala"}, "7006000690": {"Name": "Cervantes A.", "AuthorID": "7006000690", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology and Medical Oncology, Biomedical Research Institute INCLIVA, University of Valencia"}}}
