We performed comparative high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) in four mammals and characterized the conservation and divergence of chromosomal contact insulation and the resulting domain architectures within distantly related genomes. We show that the modular organization of chromosomes is robustly conserved in syntenic regions and that this is compatible with conservation of the binding landscape of the insulator protein CTCF. Specifically, conserved CTCF sites are co-localized with cohesin, are enriched at strong topological domain borders, and bind to DNA motifs with orientations that define the directionality of CTCF's long-range interactions. Conversely, divergent CTCF binding between species is correlated with divergence of internal domain structure, likely driven by local CTCF binding sequence changes, demonstrating how genome evolution can be linked to a continuous flux of local conformation changes. We also show that large-scale domains are reorganized during genome evolution as intact modules.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Binding Sites", "Biological Evolution", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Chromatin", "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation", "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone", "Chromosomes", "Dogs", "Liver", "Macaca mulatta", "Mice", "Nucleotide Motifs", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Rabbits", "Repressor Proteins", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924533047", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"40561798000": {"Name": "Vietri Rudan M.", "AuthorID": "40561798000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cancer Biology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55513017800": {"Name": "Barrington C.", "AuthorID": "55513017800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cancer Biology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57212938114": {"Name": "Henderson S.", "AuthorID": "57212938114", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cancer Biology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6507289795": {"Name": "Hadjur S.", "AuthorID": "6507289795", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cancer Biology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "56527850400": {"Name": "Ernst C.", "AuthorID": "56527850400", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, Cambridge Research Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre"}, "7004069742": {"Name": "Odom D.", "AuthorID": "7004069742", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, Cambridge Research Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre"}, "8090658900": {"Name": "Tanay A.", "AuthorID": "8090658900", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, Department of Biological Regulation, Weizmann Institute"}}}
