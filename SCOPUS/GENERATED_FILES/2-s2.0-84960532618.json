Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The management of non-renal pediatric solid organ transplant recipients has become complex over the last decade with innovations in immunosuppression and surgical techniques. Post-transplantation follow-up is essential to ensure that children have functioning allografts for as long as possible. CKD is highly prevalent in these patients, often under recognized, and has a profound impact on patient survival. These practice recommendations focus on the early detection and management of hypertension, proteinuria, and renal dysfunction in non-renal pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. We present seven practice recommendations. Renal function should be monitored regularly in organ transplant recipients, utilizing assessment of serum creatinine and cystatin C. GFR should be calculated using the new Schwartz formula. Transplant physicians should also monitor blood pressure using automated oscillometric devices and confirm repeated abnormal measures with manual blood pressure readings and ambulatory 24-h blood pressure monitoring. Proteinuria and microalbuminuria should also be assessed regularly. Referrals to a pediatric nephrologist should be made for non-renal organ transplant recipients with repeated blood pressures >95th percentile using the Fourth Task Force reference intervals, microalbumin/creatinine ratio >32.5 mg/g (3.7 mg/mmol) creatinine on repeated testing and/or GFR <90 mL/min/1.73 m2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["end-stage kidney disease", "glomerular filtration rate", "hypertension", "microalbuminuria", "proteinuria", "renal function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Albuminuria", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Creatinine", "Cystatin C", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Immunosuppression", "Kidney", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Kidney Function Tests", "Male", "Nephrology", "Oscillometry", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Proteinuria", "Transplant Recipients", "Transplantation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960532618", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"7005082763": {"Name": "Filler G.", "AuthorID": "7005082763", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Laboratory Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario"}, "6701385062": {"Name": "Melk A.", "AuthorID": "6701385062", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Kidney, Liver and Metabolic Diseases, Hannover Medical School"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "107343571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
