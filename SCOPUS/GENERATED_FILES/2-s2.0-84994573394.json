To investigate the appearance of choriocapillaris (CC) flow under drusen by comparing long-wavelength (1050 nm) swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) angiography with shorter-wavelength (840 nm) spectral-domain (SD) OCT angiography. METHODS. Patients with drusen imaged on both devices on the same day were selected and graded. Ambiguous OCT angiography (OCTA) signal loss was defined as low OCTA signal on the en face OCTA CC image that also had low OCT signal in the corresponding area on the en face OCT CC image and OCT B-scans. Unambiguous OCTA signal loss was defined as low OCTA signal on the en face OCTA CC image that did not have low OCT signal in the corresponding area on the en face OCT CC image and OCT B-scans. False-positive flow impairment on SS-OCTA was defined as ambiguous OCTA signal loss on SS-OCTA but no OCTA signal loss on SD-OCTA. False-positive flow impairment on SD-OCTA was defined as ambiguous OCTA signal loss on SD-OCTA but no OCTA signal loss on SS-OCTA. RESULTS. Nine eyes from seven patients were enrolled, 23 drusen were analyzed. On 840-nm SD-OCTA, 17 drusen (73.9%) exhibited OCTA signal loss. Fourteen (82.4%) were classified as ambiguous, and three (17.6%) were classified as unambiguous; 10 (58.8%) were classified as having false-positive flow impairment. On 1050-nm SS-OCTA, seven drusen (30.4%) exhibited OCTA signal loss and were classified as unambiguous; none were classified as having falsepositive flow impairment. CONCLUSIONS. Results showed that 1050-nm SS-OCTA appears less prone to producing areas of false-positive flow impairment under drusen.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Angiography", "Choriocapillaris", "Optical coherence tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Capillaries", "Choroid", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Male", "Microcirculation", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retinal Drusen", "Retinal Vessels", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994573394", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56006542900": {"Name": "Lane M.", "AuthorID": "56006542900", "AffiliationID": "60012191, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55359613400": {"Name": "Novais E.A.", "AuthorID": "55359613400", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, School of Medicine"}, "54391305800": {"Name": "Louzada R.N.", "AuthorID": "54391305800", "AffiliationID": "60027136", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Goi\u00e1s"}, "57146677100": {"Name": "Cole E.D.", "AuthorID": "57146677100", "AffiliationID": "60001344, 60013577", "AffiliationName": "New England Eye Center, Tufts Medical Center"}, "8528897100": {"Name": "Witkin A.J.", "AuthorID": "8528897100", "AffiliationID": "60001344, 60013577", "AffiliationName": "New England Eye Center, Tufts Medical Center"}, "6701682651": {"Name": "Baumal C.R.", "AuthorID": "6701682651", "AffiliationID": "60001344, 60013577", "AffiliationName": "New England Eye Center, Tufts Medical Center"}, "7005599946": {"Name": "Duker J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005599946", "AffiliationID": "60001344, 60013577", "AffiliationName": "New England Eye Center, Tufts Medical Center"}, "6601913210": {"Name": "Waheed N.K.", "AuthorID": "6601913210", "AffiliationID": "60001344, 60013577", "AffiliationName": "New England Eye Center, Tufts Medical Center"}, "54880010400": {"Name": "Denniston A.K.", "AuthorID": "54880010400", "AffiliationID": "60007419, 60017140", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham & Midland Eye Center, Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust"}, "57202678194": {"Name": "Moult E.M.", "AuthorID": "57202678194", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "56313470700": {"Name": "Lee B.", "AuthorID": "56313470700", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57151354100": {"Name": "Husvogt L.", "AuthorID": "57151354100", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Pattern Recognition Lab, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU)"}, "35502803600": {"Name": "Fujimoto J.G.", "AuthorID": "35502803600", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Center for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
