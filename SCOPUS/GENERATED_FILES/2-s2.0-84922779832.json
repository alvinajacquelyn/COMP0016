KGaA.A comparative study of molecular balances by NMR spectroscopy indicates that noncovalent functional-group interactions with an arene dominate over those with an alkene, and that a \u03c0-facial intramolecular hydrogen bond from a hydroxy group to an arene is favored by approximately 1.2 kJ mol-1. The strongest interaction observed in this study was with the cyano group. Analysis of the series of groups CH2CH3, CH=CH2, C\u2261CH, and C\u2261N shows a correlation between conformational free-energy differences and the calculated charge on the C\u03b1 atom of these substituents, which is indicative of the electrostatic nature of their \u03c0 interactions. Changes in the free-energy differences of conformers show a linear dependence on the solvent hydrogen bond acceptor parameter \u03b2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conformational analysis", "Molecular balances", "NMR spectroscopy", "Noncovalent interactions", "\u03c0 interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comparative studies", "Conformational analysis", "Conformational free energy", "Free-energy difference", "Group interaction", "Hydrogen bond acceptors", "Intra-molecular hydrogen bonds", "Non-covalent interaction", "Alkenes", "Hydrocarbons", "Models, Molecular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922779832", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"7102384385": {"Name": "Aliev A.", "AuthorID": "7102384385", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56516959100": {"Name": "Arendorf J.", "AuthorID": "56516959100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54941263900": {"Name": "Pavlakos I.", "AuthorID": "54941263900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "26431056100": {"Name": "Moreno R.", "AuthorID": "26431056100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7201467488": {"Name": "Porter M.", "AuthorID": "7201467488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005716929": {"Name": "Motherwell W.", "AuthorID": "7005716929", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005542267": {"Name": "Rzepa H.", "AuthorID": "7005542267", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}}}
