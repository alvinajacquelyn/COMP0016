All rights reserved.Cut7, the sole kinesin-5 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is essential for mitosis. Like other yeast kinesin-5 motors, Cut7 can reverse its stepping direction, by mechanisms that are currently unclear. Here we show that for full-length Cut7, the key determinant of stepping direction is the degree of motor crowding on the microtubule lattice, with greater crowding converting the motor from minus end-directed to plus end-directed stepping. To explain how high Cut7 occupancy causes this reversal, we postulate a simple proximity sensing mechanism that operates via steric blocking. We propose that the minus end-directed stepping action of Cut7 is selectively inhibited by collisions with neighbors under crowded conditions, whereas its plus end-directed action, being less space-hungry, is not. In support of this idea, we show that the direction of Cut7-driven microtubule sliding can be reversed by crowding it with non-Cut7 proteins. Thus, crowding by either dynein microtubule binding domain or Klp2, a kinesin-14, converts Cut7 from net minus end-directed to net plus end-directed stepping. Biochemical assays confirm that the Cut7 N terminus increases Cut7 occupancy by binding directly to microtubules. Direct observation by cryoEM reveals that this occupancy-enhancing N-terminal domain is partially ordered. Overall, our data point to a steric blocking mechanism for directional reversal through which collisions of Cut7 motor domains with their neighbors inhibit their minus end-directed stepping action, but not their plus end-directed stepping action. Our model can potentially reconcile a number of previous, apparently conflicting, observations and proposals for the reversal mechanism of yeast kinesins-5.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bidirectional kinesin", "Cut7", "Kinesin crowding", "Kinesin-5", "Mitotic kinesin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Chromosome Segregation", "Kinesin", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Microtubules", "Mitosis", "Protein Domains", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014916390", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57213459234": {"Name": "Britto M.", "AuthorID": "57213459234", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mechanochemical Cell Biology, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "7202235831": {"Name": "Cross R.", "AuthorID": "7202235831", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mechanochemical Cell Biology, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "14521132500": {"Name": "Goulet A.", "AuthorID": "14521132500", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60008134, 60101370", "AffiliationName": "Architecture et Fonction des Macromol\u00e9cules Biologiques, UMR 7257, CNRS, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9"}, "57193650711": {"Name": "Rizvi S.", "AuthorID": "57193650711", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "44462114700": {"Name": "Von Loeffelholz O.", "AuthorID": "44462114700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "6701857441": {"Name": "Moores C.", "AuthorID": "6701857441", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}}}
