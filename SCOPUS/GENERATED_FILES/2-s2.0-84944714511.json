Since most PET/CT scans are performed in the setting of a known nonthyroid malignancy, the need for \u201cincidentalomas\u201d to be further investigated and managed depends on the stage, prognosis, and current treatment plan for the known malignancy. We present a case describing the management of an incidental F-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid thyroid nodule detected in a patient with known metastatic colorectal cancer. On the basis of this case, we discuss the management of incidental PET-detected thyroid nodules in patients with metastatic cancer. Thyroid \u201cincidentalomas\u201d must be seen in the context of the prognosis and treatment plan for the known malignancy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Imaging", "Metastasis", "Morbidity", "PET", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944714511", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56741112400": {"Name": "Dearman C.", "AuthorID": "56741112400", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Oxford"}, "54943116300": {"Name": "Hill E.J.", "AuthorID": "54943116300", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Oxford"}, "57197055361": {"Name": "Franklin J.M.", "AuthorID": "57197055361", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Oxford"}, "7005152171": {"Name": "Sadler G.P.", "AuthorID": "7005152171", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrine Surgery, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Oxford"}, "16644272300": {"Name": "Wang L.M.", "AuthorID": "16644272300", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Hepatobiliary Surgery, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Oxford"}, "8614271100": {"Name": "Silva M.A.", "AuthorID": "8614271100", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Hepatobiliary Surgery, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Oxford"}, "7407243601": {"Name": "Sharma R.A.", "AuthorID": "7407243601", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60026851, 60172675, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Oxford"}}}
