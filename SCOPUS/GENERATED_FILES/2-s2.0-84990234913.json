Extensive tests with respect to basis sets, target models and scatteringmodels are performed. The final results are reported for the larger cc-pVTZ basis setusing a 50 state close-coupling (CC) calculation. The Breit-Wigner eigenphase sum and thetime-delay methods are used to detect and fit any resonances. Both these methods find avery narrow 2\u03a3+ symmetry Feshbach-type resonance very close to thetarget excitation threshold of the b 3\u03a3+ state which lies at 12.9 eV in the calculations. Thisresonance is seen in the CC calculation using cc-pVTZ basis set while a CC calculationusing the cc-pVDZ basis set does not produce this feature. The electronic structure ofCO\u2212 is analysedin the asymptotic region; 45 molecular states are found to correlate with statesdissociating to an anion and an atom. Electronic structure calculations are used to studythe behaviour of these states at large internuclear separation. Quantitative results forthe total, elastic and electronic excitation cross sections are also presented. Thesignificance of these results for models of the observed dissociative electron attachmentof CO in the 10 eV region is discussed.
