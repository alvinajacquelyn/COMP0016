KGaA, WeinheimOligomeric amyloid structures are crucial therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's and other amyloid diseases. However, these oligomers are too small to be resolved by standard light microscopy. We have developed a simple and versatile tool to image amyloid structures by using thioflavin T without the need for covalent labeling or immunostaining. The dynamic binding of single dye molecules generates photon bursts that are used for fluorophore localization on a nanometer scale. Thus, photobleaching cannot degrade image quality, allowing for extended observation times. Super-resolution transient amyloid binding microscopy promises to directly image native amyloid by using standard probes and record amyloid dynamics over minutes to days. We imaged amyloid fibrils from multiple polypeptides, oligomeric, and fibrillar structures formed during different stages of amyloid-\u03b2 aggregation, as well as the structural remodeling of amyloid-\u03b2 fibrils by the compound epi-gallocatechin gallate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloid beta-peptides", "long-term imaging", "single-molecule localization microscopy", "single-molecule studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Benzothiazoles", "Equipment Design", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Optical Imaging", "Protein Aggregates", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052406659", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57203584525": {"Name": "Spehar K.", "AuthorID": "57203584525", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "57202579459": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "57202579459", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy, Environmental, and Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "57191108365": {"Name": "Kedia N.", "AuthorID": "57191108365", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "57203588944": {"Name": "Nahass G.R.", "AuthorID": "57203588944", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "7801468972": {"Name": "Bieschke J.", "AuthorID": "7801468972", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60033212", "AffiliationName": "MRC Prion Unit, UCL Institute of Prion Diseases"}, "55840423900": {"Name": "Ding T.", "AuthorID": "55840423900", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "55627316300": {"Name": "Lu J.", "AuthorID": "55627316300", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "23668100200": {"Name": "Lew M.D.", "AuthorID": "23668100200", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis"}}}
