All rights reserved.The 'neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation' (NBIA) disease family entails movement or cognitive impairment, often with psychiatric features. To understand how iron loading affects the brain, we studied mice with disruption of two iron regulatory genes, hemochromatosis (Hfe) and transferrin receptor 2 (Tfr2). Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy demonstrated increased iron in the Hfe -/- \u00d7 Tfr2 mut brain (P=0.002, n \u22655/group), primarily localized by Perls' staining to myelinated structures. Western immunoblotting showed increases of the iron storage protein ferritin light polypeptide and microarray and real-time reverse transcription-PCR revealed decreased transcript levels (P<0.04, n \u22655/group) for five other NBIA genes, phospholipase A2 group VI, fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, ceruloplasmin, chromosome 19 open reading frame 12 and ATPase type 13A2. Apart from the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin, all are involved in myelin homeostasis; 16 other myelin-related genes also showed reduced expression (P<0.05), although gross myelin structure and integrity appear unaffected (P>0.05). Overlap (P<0.0001) of differentially expressed genes in Hfe -/- \u00d7 Tfr2 mut brain with human gene co-expression networks suggests iron loading influences expression of NBIA-related and myelin-related genes co-expressed in normal human basal ganglia. There was overlap (P<0.0001) of genes differentially expressed in Hfe -/- \u00d7 Tfr2 mut brain and post-mortem NBIA basal ganglia. Hfe -/- \u00d7 Tfr2 mut mice were hyperactive (P<0.0112) without apparent cognitive impairment by IntelliCage testing (P>0.05). These results implicate myelin-related systems involved in NBIA neuropathogenesis in early responses to iron loading. This may contribute to behavioral symptoms in NBIA and hemochromatosis and is relevant to patients with abnormal iron status and psychiatric disorders involving myelin abnormalities or resistant to conventional treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Gene Expression", "Hemochromatosis", "Hemochromatosis Protein", "Iron", "Iron Metabolism Disorders", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred AKR", "Myelin Sheath", "Neuroaxonal Dystrophies", "Pedigree", "Receptors, Transferrin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953279157", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57021111900": {"Name": "Heidari M.", "AuthorID": "57021111900", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy MSB, University of Newcastle"}, "56672585700": {"Name": "Bassett B.", "AuthorID": "56672585700", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy MSB, University of Newcastle"}, "6603563509": {"Name": "Milward E.A.", "AuthorID": "6603563509", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy MSB, University of Newcastle"}, "15829670700": {"Name": "Johnstone D.M.", "AuthorID": "15829670700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Bosch Institute and Discipline of Physiology, University of Sydney"}, "7401483693": {"Name": "Graham R.M.", "AuthorID": "7401483693", "AffiliationID": "60090173, 60031226", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences and Curtin Health Innovation Research Institute - Biosciences, Curtin University of Technology"}, "7005942097": {"Name": "Olynyk J.K.", "AuthorID": "7005942097", "AffiliationID": "60189789", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Fremantle Hospital"}, "7004519700": {"Name": "Chua A.C.G.", "AuthorID": "7004519700", "AffiliationID": "60005202", "AffiliationName": "Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research"}, "7004242701": {"Name": "Trinder D.", "AuthorID": "7004242701", "AffiliationID": "60005202", "AffiliationName": "Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research"}, "12806329300": {"Name": "House M.J.", "AuthorID": "12806329300", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Western Australia"}, "57217447171": {"Name": "Collingwood J.F.", "AuthorID": "57217447171", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Engineering in Biomedicine, School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "8581587200": {"Name": "Bettencourt C.", "AuthorID": "8581587200", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57217124361": {"Name": "Ryten M.", "AuthorID": "57217124361", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London"}}}
