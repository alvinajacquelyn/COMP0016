Various potential feedstocks are available including glycerol, rapeseed meal and municipal solid waste (MSW). For biorefinery applications the byproduct streams from distilleries and bioethanol plants, such as wheat-based dried distiller's grain with solubles (DDGS), are particularly attractive, as they do not compete for land use. Wheat DDGS is rich in polymeric sugars, proteins and oils, making it ideal as a current animal feed, but also a future substrate for the synthesis of fine and commodity chemicals. This review focuses on the extraction and valorization of the protein fraction of wheat DDGS as this has received comparatively little attention to date. Since wheat DDGS production is expected to increase greatly in the near future, as a consequence of expansion of the bioethanol industry in the UK, strategies to valorize the component fractions of DDGS are urgently needed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biobased chemicals", "Bioethanol industry", "Commodity chemicals", "Distiller's grains", "Municipal solid waste (MSW)", "Potential feedstock", "Protein fractions", "Sustainable economy", "Chemical Fractionation", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Desiccation", "Glutens", "Hydrolysis", "Industrial Waste", "Solubility", "Triticum", "Whole Grains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940959050", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"56515416600": {"Name": "Villegas-Torres M.", "AuthorID": "56515416600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004669230": {"Name": "Lye G.", "AuthorID": "7004669230", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
