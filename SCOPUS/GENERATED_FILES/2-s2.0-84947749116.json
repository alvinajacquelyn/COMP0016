Abstract Eating disorders are rare in children, but disordered eating is common. Understanding the phenomenology of disordered eating in childhood can aid prevention of full-blown eating disorders. The purpose of this review is to systematically extract and synthesize the evidence on parental and child characteristics related to early-onset disordered eating. Systematic searches were conducted in PubMED/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycInfo using the following search terms: eating disorder, disordered eating, problem eating, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating, child, preadolescent, and early onset. Studies published from 1990 to 2013 addressing parental and child characteristics of disordered eating in children aged 6 to 12 years were eligible for inclusion. The search was restricted to studies with cross-sectional, case-control, or longitudinal designs, studies in English, and with abstracts available. Forty-four studies fit these criteria. Most studies were based on community samples with a cross-sectional design. The included studies varied considerably in size, instruments used to assess early-onset disordered eating, and parental and child characteristics investigated. Important determinants included the following: higher body weight, previously reported disordered eating, body dissatisfaction, depression, parental disordered eating, and parental comments/concerns about childs weight and eating. The findings were inconsistent for sex, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, self-esteem/worth, and parental body weight. In conclusion, characteristics related to early-onset disordered eating have mainly been explored with a cross-sectional design. Full understanding of causal pathways will require good-quality longitudinal studies designed to address the influence of parental eating behaviors, mental and physical health, family interactions, and child growth patterns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anorexia nervosa", "binge-eating disorder", "bulimia nervosa", "children", "eating disorders", "preadolescents", "risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Body Image", "Child", "Depression", "Feeding and Eating Disorders of Childhood", "Feeding Behavior", "Humans", "Parent-Child Relations", "Parents", "Psychotherapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947749116", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55566247100": {"Name": "Larsen P.S.", "AuthorID": "55566247100", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Section of Social Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Section of Social Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen"}, "57221543589": {"Name": "Andersen A.M.N.", "AuthorID": "57221543589", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Section of Social Medicine, Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen"}, "16318056800": {"Name": "Strandberg-Larsen K.", "AuthorID": "16318056800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Behavioral and Brain Sciences Unit, University College London, Institute of Child Health"}}}
