Alleviating and repairing cardiac injury associated with myocardial infarction (MI) is key to improving this burden. Homing signals mobilize and recruit stem cells to the ischaemic myocardium where they exert beneficial paracrine effects. The chemoattractant cytokine SDF-1\u03b1 and its associated receptor CXCR4 are upregulated after MI and appear to be important in this context. Activation of CXCR4 promotes both cardiomyocyte survival and stem cell migration towards the infarcted myocardium. These effects have beneficial effects on infarct size, and left ventricular remodelling and function. However, the timing of endogenous SDF-1\u03b1 release and CXCR4 upregulation may not be optimal. Furthermore, current ELISA-based assays cannot distinguish between active SDF-1\u03b1, and SDF-1\u03b1 inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Current therapeutic approaches aim to recruit the SDF-1\u03b1-CXCR4 pathway or prolong SDF-1\u03b1 life-time by preventing its cleavage by DPP4. This review assesses the evidence supporting these approaches and proposes SDF-1\u03b1 as an important confounder in recent studies of DPP4 inhibitors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CXCR4", "Heart failure", "Ischaemic cardiomyopathy", "SDF-1\u03b1", "Stromal cell derived factor 1\u03b1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cardiomyopathies", "Chemokine CXCL12", "Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4", "Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors", "Half-Life", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Myocardium", "Receptors, CXCR4", "Signal Transduction", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042925432", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55263618500": {"Name": "Ziff O.J.", "AuthorID": "55263618500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "26641821000": {"Name": "Bromage D.I.", "AuthorID": "26641821000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute, King's College London, Lambeth Wing St Thomas' Hospital"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.M.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
