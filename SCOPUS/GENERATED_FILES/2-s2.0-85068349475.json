Galaxies undergoing violent episodes of star-formation are expected to be rich in high energy cosmic rays (CRs). We have investigated the role of these CRs in such environments, particularly how they could contribute to this burst-like SFH via quenching and feedback. These high energy particles interact with the baryon and radiation fields of their host via hadronic processes to produce secondary leptons. The secondary particles then also interact with ambient radiation fields to generate X-rays through inverse-Compton scattering. In addition, they can thermalise directly with the semi-ionised medium via Coulomb processes. Heating at a rate of \u223c10-25\u00e2 erg\u00e2 cm-3\u00e2 s-1 can be attained by Coulomb processes in a star-forming galaxy with one core-collapse SN event per decade, and this is sufficient to cause quenching of star-formation. At high-redshift, a substantial amount of CR secondary electron energy can be diverted into inverse-Compton X-ray emission. This yields an X-ray luminosity of above 1041\u00e2 erg\u00e2 s-1 by redshift z\u00e2 =\u00e2 7 which drives a further heating effect, operating over larger scales. This would be able to halt inflowing cold gas filaments, strangulating subsequent star-formation. We selected a sample of 16 starburst and post-starburst galaxies at 7\u00e2\u00e2\u00e2 z\u00e2\u00e2\u00e2 9 and determine the star-formation rates they could have sustained. We applied a model with CR injection, propagation and heating to calculate energy deposition rates in these 16 sources. Our calculations show that CR feedback cannot be neglected as it has the strength to suppress star-formation in these systems. We also show that their currently observed quiescence is consistent with the suffocation of cold inflows, probably by a combination of X-ray and CR heating.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astroparticle physics", "Cosmic rays", "Galaxies: evolution", "Galaxies: ISM", "X-rays: galaxies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Astroparticle physics", "Galaxies: evolutions", "Galaxies: ISM", "High-energy cosmic rays", "High-energy particles", "Inverse Compton scattering", "Inverse Compton X-rays", "X rays:galaxies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068349475", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190976687": {"Name": "Owen E.R.", "AuthorID": "57190976687", "AffiliationID": "60018029", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, Department of Physics, National Tsing Hua University"}, "57201393478": {"Name": "Wu K.", "AuthorID": "57201393478", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, University of Sydney"}, "57209640970": {"Name": "Kataoka N.", "AuthorID": "57209640970", "AffiliationID": "60017585", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Kyoto Sangyo University"}, "8590345800": {"Name": "Jin X.", "AuthorID": "8590345800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and McGill Space Institute, McGill University"}, "57194565193": {"Name": "Surajbali P.", "AuthorID": "57194565193", "AffiliationID": "60012804", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut fur Kernphysik"}}}
