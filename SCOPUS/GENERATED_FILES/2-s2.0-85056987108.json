For instance, theft of online service credentials is an emerging problem, especially in the Dark Web, where the average price for someone\u2019s online identity is \u00a3820. Previous research studied the modus operandi of criminals that obtain stolen account credentials through Surface Web outlets. As part of an effort to understand how the same crime unfolds in the Surface Web and the Dark Web, this study seeks to compare the modus operandi of criminals acting on both by leaking Gmail honey accounts in Dark Web outlets. The results are compared to a previous similar experiment performed in the Surface Web. Simulating operating activity of criminals, we posted 100 Gmail account credentials on hidden services on the Dark Web and monitored the activity that they attracted using a honeypot infrastructure. More specifically, we analysed the data generated by the two experiments to find differences in the activity observed with the aim of understanding how leaked credentials are used in both Web environments. We observed that different types of malicious activity happen on honey accounts depending on the Web environment they are released on. Our results can provide the research community with insights into how stolen accounts are being manipulated in the wild for different Web environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Account compromise", "Cybercrime", "Measurement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056987108", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57204757190": {"Name": "Bermudez Villalva D.A.", "AuthorID": "57204757190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "56369054900": {"Name": "Onaolapo J.", "AuthorID": "56369054900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36810977700": {"Name": "Stringhini G.", "AuthorID": "36810977700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
