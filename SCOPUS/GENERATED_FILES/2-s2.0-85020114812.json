An adequate analgesic strategy is important to improve post-operative recovery and welfare in laboratory rats and mice. In addition, it is desirable to provide post-operative analgesia using methods that are minimally invasive and stressful. This study investigated the antinociceptive effects of orally administered buprenorphine ingested in Nutella\u00ae in comparison with subcutaneous buprenorphine administration. By exposing the animal to a thermal stimulus using a hot plate, significant antinociceptive effects of voluntarily ingested buprenorphine administered in Nutella\u00ae were demonstrated. This was evident at doses of 1.0 mg/kg 60 and 120 min post administration (P<0.01), although antinociceptive effects were not as marked as with subcutaneous administration, and had a later onset. It is advised to administer the oral formulation of buprenorphine in Nutella\u00ae in a 10-fold higher dose, as well as approximately 60 min earlier, than with the more commonly employed subcutaneous route of administration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analgesia", "Buprenorphine", "Oral treatment", "Rats", "Refinement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Analgesics", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Animals", "Buprenorphine", "Eating", "Hot Temperature", "Mice", "Rats", "Reaction Time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020114812", "SubjectAreas": [["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"57192063781": {"Name": "Hestehave S.", "AuthorID": "57192063781", "AffiliationID": "60027906", "AffiliationName": "H Lundbeck A/S"}, "6602332511": {"Name": "Abelson K.S.P.", "AuthorID": "6602332511", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "22135271100": {"Name": "Munro G.", "AuthorID": "22135271100", "AffiliationID": "60027906", "AffiliationName": "H Lundbeck A/S"}, "57194430526": {"Name": "Pedersen T.B.", "AuthorID": "57194430526", "AffiliationID": "60027906", "AffiliationName": "H Lundbeck A/S"}}}
