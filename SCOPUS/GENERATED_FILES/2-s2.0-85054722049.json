We aimed to determine whether the top ACR tertile remained associated with DN and CVD risk over the 2-4-year AdDIT study. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred fifty adolescents (mean age 14.1 years [SD 1.6]) with baseline ACR in the upper tertile (high-ACR group) recruited to the AdDIT trial, who remained untreated, and 396 (age 14.3 years [1.6]) with ACR in the middle and lower tertiles (low-ACR group), who completed the parallel AdDIT observational study, were evaluated prospectively with assessments of ACR and renal and CVD markers, combined with carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) at baseline and end of study. RESULTS: Afteramedian follow-up of 3.9 years, the cumulative incidence of microalbuminuria was 16.3% in the high-ACR versus 5.5% in the low-ACR group(log-rank P < 0.001). Cox models showed independent contributions of the high-ACR group (hazard ratio 4.29 [95% CI 2.08-8.85]) and HbA1c (1.37 [1.10-1.72]) to microalbuminuria risk. cIMT change from baseline was significantly greater in the high-versus low-ACR group (mean difference 0.010 mm [0.079], P = 0.006). Changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate, systolic blood pressure, and hs-CRP were also significantly greater in the high-ACR group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: ACR at the higher end of the normal range at the age of 10-16 years is associated with an increased risk of progression to microalbuminuria and future CVD risk, independently of HbA1c.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Albuminuria", "Blood Pressure", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness", "Child", "Creatinine", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetic Angiopathies", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Kidney", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Urinalysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054722049", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"9243301200": {"Name": "Marcovecchio M.L.", "AuthorID": "9243301200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge"}, "56908198700": {"Name": "Dunger D.B.", "AuthorID": "56908198700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, University of Cambridge"}, "56190407900": {"Name": "Chiesa S.T.", "AuthorID": "56190407900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes, University College London"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes, University College London"}, "56187930500": {"Name": "Armitage J.", "AuthorID": "56187930500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60022323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit, Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "16136328200": {"Name": "Daneman D.", "AuthorID": "16136328200", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "13807128900": {"Name": "Mahmud F.H.", "AuthorID": "13807128900", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7003470857": {"Name": "Donaghue K.C.", "AuthorID": "7003470857", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Children's Hospital at Westmead, University of Sydney"}, "35315843900": {"Name": "Jones T.W.", "AuthorID": "35315843900", "AffiliationID": "60000096, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia"}, "7401823584": {"Name": "Marshall S.M.", "AuthorID": "7401823584", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine (Diabetes), Faculty of Clinical Medical Sciences, Newcastle University"}, "7004935222": {"Name": "Neil H.A.W.", "AuthorID": "7004935222", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Oxford"}, "57207516991": {"Name": "Dalton R.N.", "AuthorID": "57207516991", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St. Thomas' National Health Service Foundation Trust"}}}
