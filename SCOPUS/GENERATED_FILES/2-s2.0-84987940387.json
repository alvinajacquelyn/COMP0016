We develop a dynamic heteroskedastic procedure and use z-transform analysis to determine the potential degrees of contagion and explore possible volatility spillovers. Among our main results, the Russian market substantially decoupled from the vast majority of world markets, irrespectively of the strength of economic ties between Russia and the corresponding countries. Nonetheless, the crisis was characterized by large transmissions of volatility associated with the Russian stock market, particularly in emerging and frontier economies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Equity market", "Financial contagion", "Sanctions", "Ukrainian crisis", "Volatility spillover"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987940387", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"]], "AuthorData": {"56197676300": {"Name": "Castagneto-Gissey G.", "AuthorID": "56197676300", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, The Bartlett"}, "6506166454": {"Name": "Nivorozhkin E.", "AuthorID": "6506166454", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, The Bartlett"}}}
