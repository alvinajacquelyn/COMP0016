Our contribution focuses on the part that healthcare organizations play in this. We draw on organizational sociology, which theorizes that while organizational structures, cultures, and practices may appear neutral \u2013 and rely for their legitimacy on this \u2013 they may, in fact, operate in the interests of some social groups and less in the interests of others. This proposition is worked through new empirical research on employee-driven innovation in the UK National Health Service. In both our case studies, front-line staff working with some of the most vulnerable citizens had identified the organization of care as both part of the problem and \u2013 potentially \u2013 part of the solution. In tracing their efforts to change the organization of care, we learn more about what it might take to mobilize resources in support of those whose lives are most affected by health inequalities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Employee-driven innovation", "health inequality", "homeless health", "organizational sociology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062892732", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57204960429": {"Name": "Halford S.", "AuthorID": "57204960429", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "57198885623": {"Name": "Lyle K.", "AuthorID": "57198885623", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "8657121300": {"Name": "Taylor R.", "AuthorID": "8657121300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "10140362900": {"Name": "Fuller A.", "AuthorID": "10140362900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
