To extend the usefulness of contact prediction, we have designed a new meta-predictor (MetaPSICOV) which combines three distinct approaches for inferring covariation signals from multiple sequence alignments, considers a broad range of other sequence-derived features and, uniquely, a range of metrics which describe both the local and global quality of the input multiple sequence alignment. Finally, we use a two-stage predictor, where the second stage filters the output of the first stage. This two-stage predictor is additionally evaluated on its ability to accurately predict the long range network of hydrogen bonds, including correctly assigning the donor and acceptor residues. Results: Using the original PSICOV benchmark set of 150 protein families, MetaPSICOV achieves a mean precision of 0.54 for top-L predicted long range contacts - around 60% higher than PSICOV, and around 40% better than CCMpred. In de novo protein structure prediction using FRAGFOLD, MetaPSICOV is able to improve the TM-scores of models by a median of 0.05 compared with PSICOV. Lastly, for predicting long range hydrogen bonding, MetaPSICOV-HB achieves a precision of 0.69 for the top-L/10 hydrogen bonds compared with just 0.26 for the baseline MetaPSICOV.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Protein", "Humans", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Protein Folding", "Proteins", "Sequence Alignment", "Sequence Analysis, Protein", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929144039", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57203189821": {"Name": "Jones D.", "AuthorID": "57203189821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7403106241": {"Name": "Singh T.", "AuthorID": "7403106241", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57201380493": {"Name": "Kosciolek T.", "AuthorID": "57201380493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36615883800": {"Name": "Tetchner S.", "AuthorID": "36615883800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Group, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
