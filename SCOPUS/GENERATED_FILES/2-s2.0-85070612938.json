Despite the growing interest in global urban health, there are limited resources available that provide an extensive and advanced exploration into the health of urban populations in a transnational context. This volume offers a high-quality and comprehensive examination of global urban health issues by leading urban health scholars from around the world. The book brings together a multi-disciplinary perspective on urban health, with chapter contributions emphasizing disciplines in the social sciences, construction sciences and medical sciences. The co-editors of the collection come from a number of different disciplinary backgrounds that have been at the forefront of urban health research, including public health, epidemiology, geography, city planning and urban design. The book is intended to be a reference in global urban health for research libraries and faculty collections. It will also be appropriate as a text for university class adoption in upper-division under-graduate courses and above. The proposed volume is extensive and offers enough breadth and depth to enable it to be used for courses emphasizing a U.S., or wider Western perspective, as well as courses on urban health emphasizing a global context.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070612938", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6602198955": {"Name": "Vojnovic I.", "AuthorID": "6602198955", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Michigan State University"}, "55509586400": {"Name": "Pearson A.", "AuthorID": "55509586400", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Michigan State University, Department of Geography, Environment and Spatial Sciences"}, "12752430200": {"Name": "Asiki G.", "AuthorID": "12752430200", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC)"}, "6602277052": {"Name": "DeVerteuil G.", "AuthorID": "6602277052", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and Planning, Cardiff University"}, "7402802360": {"Name": "Allen A.", "AuthorID": "7402802360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit (DPU), University College London (UCL)"}}}
