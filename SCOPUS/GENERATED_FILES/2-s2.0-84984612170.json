The enhanced photoreactivity over bismuth hybridized BiOCl catalyst (Bi/BiOCl) has been reported recently, however, the mechanistic understandings of this improved photoreactivity especially the optical behavior of bismuth nanoparticles (Bi NPs) are still obscured and in debate. The optical absorption features of Bi NPs and the charge transfer characteristic between bismuth and BiOCl have been considered as the major physicochemical origin for the promoted photoreactivity. Based on the advanced (in-situ) electron microscopy of monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging mode (Mono-STEM-EELS) along with related theoretical investigations, in this work, we for the first time distinguished and explained the optical absorption originated from the localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) effect and direct band gap transition in an individual bismuth nanoparticle as well as transportation of photogenerated carriers at the interface of Bi/BiOCl. These findings could provide better understandings about the origin of the improved photoreactivity of various bismuth-hybridized photocatalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BiOCl", "Bismuth", "Electron microscopy", "Monochromated EELS", "Photocatalytic"], "IndexKeywords": ["BiOCl", "Bismuth nanoparticles", "Localized surface plasmon resonance", "Photo-catalytic", "Photogenerated carriers", "Scanning transmission electron microscopy", "Theoretical investigations", "Transfer characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984612170", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"20435527800": {"Name": "Chang X.", "AuthorID": "20435527800", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "54944470900": {"Name": "Xie L.", "AuthorID": "54944470900", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "57190945592": {"Name": "Dong C.", "AuthorID": "57190945592", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "37063958700": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "37063958700", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "57190951030": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57190951030", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "57190947265": {"Name": "Qiao X.", "AuthorID": "57190947265", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "56290234500": {"Name": "Wang P.", "AuthorID": "56290234500", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56727283200": {"Name": "Lu K.", "AuthorID": "56727283200", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of The Environment, Nanjing University"}, "35849110300": {"Name": "Mao L.", "AuthorID": "35849110300", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of The Environment, Nanjing University"}, "55653146800": {"Name": "Qi Q.", "AuthorID": "55653146800", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60033100", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University"}, "57192223205": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "57192223205", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60033100", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Southeast University"}, "7003320531": {"Name": "Gondal M.A.", "AuthorID": "7003320531", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department and Center of Excellence in Nanotechnology, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals"}, "55606527900": {"Name": "Rashid S.G.", "AuthorID": "55606527900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences, University of Queensland"}, "55387694300": {"Name": "Dai Q.I.", "AuthorID": "55387694300", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}}}
