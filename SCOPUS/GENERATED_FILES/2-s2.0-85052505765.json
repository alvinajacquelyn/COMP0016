Serum levels of serotonin were analyzed in 950 men (aged 69 to 81 years), participating in the Gothenburg part of the population-based study MrOS Sweden. Men taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) had a mean value of 31.2 \u03bcg/L compared with 159.4 \u03bcg/L in those not taking SSRIs. SSRI users were excluded from further analysis. During 10-year follow-up, 224 men exhibited fractures, including 97 nonvertebral osteoporotic fractures (57 hip fractures), and 86 vertebral fractures. Serotonin was associated with hip fracture in linear analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03\u20131.58) and to all fractures in a nonlinear manner, when quintiles of serotonin was included in quadratic terms (HR = 1.12, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.21). Men in serotonin quintile 5 had, in multivariable analysis, a HR of 2.30 (95% CI 1.31\u20134.02) for hip fracture and 1.82 (95% CI 1.17\u20132.85) for nonvertebral fractures compared with men in quintiles 1 to 4. Men in quintile 1 had, in multivariable analysis, a HR of 1.76 (95% CI 1.03\u20132.99) for nonvertebral fractures compared with men in quintiles 2 to 4. No association was found with vertebral fractures. Individuals in serotonin quintile 1 had higher prevalence of falls compared with quintiles 2 to 5 (odds ratio = 1.90, 95% CI 1.26\u20132.87). Serotonin was positively associated with hand-grip strength (r = 0.08, p = 0.02) and inversely with hip BMD (r = \u22120.10, p = 0.003). To assess the association between SSRIs and falls and fractures, the total MrOS Sweden cohort was examined (n = 3014). SSRI users (n = 90) had increased prevalence of falls (16% versus 33%, p = 0.0001) and increased rate of incident fractures (28.0 versus 44.7 per 1000 person-years, p = 0.018). We present novel data showing that high levels of serotonin predict an increased risk for hip fracture and nonvertebral osteoporotic fractures. \u00a9 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BMD", "FALLS", "FRACTURES", "SERUM SEROTONIN", "SSRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Density", "Hip Fractures", "Humans", "Osteoporotic Fractures", "Risk Factors", "Serotonin", "Sweden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052505765", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57205348218": {"Name": "Kristjansdottir H.L.", "AuthorID": "57205348218", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Section of Hematology and Coagulation, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "15757660600": {"Name": "Lewerin C.", "AuthorID": "15757660600", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Section of Hematology and Coagulation, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7005705643": {"Name": "Lerner U.H.", "AuthorID": "7005705643", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bone and Arthritis Research, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute for Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "36167545900": {"Name": "Sundh D.", "AuthorID": "36167545900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7003987830": {"Name": "Lorentzon M.", "AuthorID": "7003987830", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57203254236": {"Name": "Ohlsson C.", "AuthorID": "57203254236", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bone and Arthritis Research, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute for Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "24174880900": {"Name": "Mellstr\u00f6m D.", "AuthorID": "24174880900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7801409055": {"Name": "Waern E.", "AuthorID": "7801409055", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "23027246200": {"Name": "Johansson H.", "AuthorID": "23027246200", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Health and Aging, Catholic University of Australia"}, "16178166100": {"Name": "Karlsson M.", "AuthorID": "16178166100", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics and Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "35373488900": {"Name": "Cummings S.R.", "AuthorID": "35373488900", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
