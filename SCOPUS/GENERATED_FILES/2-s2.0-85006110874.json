Two different photomixer designs, based on a single-sided NSG and a double-sided NSG, embedded in the same antenna design and fabricated on an Fe doped InGaAsP substrate, are characterized with \u223c1550 nm excitation. They are shown to exhibit similar performance in terms of spectral bandwidth and emitted power. The emission is mapped in terms of the laser excitation position, from which the emission mechanism is assigned to an enhanced optical electric field at the tips of the NSGs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna design", "Continuous waves", "Emission mechanism", "Excitation position", "Nano-gratings", "Nano-structured", "Spectral bandwidth", "Terahertz emissions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006110874", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56374134700": {"Name": "Mohandas R.A.", "AuthorID": "56374134700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microwaves and Photonics, University of Leeds"}, "25921429900": {"Name": "Freeman J.R.", "AuthorID": "25921429900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microwaves and Photonics, University of Leeds"}, "23006013600": {"Name": "Rosamond M.C.", "AuthorID": "23006013600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microwaves and Photonics, University of Leeds"}, "56911604400": {"Name": "Davies A.G.", "AuthorID": "56911604400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microwaves and Photonics, University of Leeds"}, "7005415578": {"Name": "Linfield E.H.", "AuthorID": "7005415578", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microwaves and Photonics, University of Leeds"}, "7201481463": {"Name": "Dean P.", "AuthorID": "7201481463", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microwaves and Photonics, University of Leeds"}, "8276654100": {"Name": "Ponnampalam L.", "AuthorID": "8276654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14053694500": {"Name": "Canard P.J.", "AuthorID": "14053694500", "AffiliationID": "60118521", "AffiliationName": "CIP Technologies, Adastral Park, Martlesham Heath"}, "57206508022": {"Name": "Robertson M.J.", "AuthorID": "57206508022", "AffiliationID": "60118521", "AffiliationName": "CIP Technologies, Adastral Park, Martlesham Heath"}, "7102297209": {"Name": "Moodie D.G.", "AuthorID": "7102297209", "AffiliationID": "60118521", "AffiliationName": "CIP Technologies, Adastral Park, Martlesham Heath"}}}
