Combination with a known value of the solubility in water enables corresponding partition coefficients from water to these solvents to be deduced. It is shown that solubilities, via the partition coefficients, can yield the Abraham descriptors for 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone, and that these, in turn, can be used to estimate a very large number of further solubilities, partition coefficients, and values of biological and environmental properties. This method of extracting information from solubilities is further illustrated using literature data on solubilities of biotin and of caprolactam.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Descriptors", "Environmental property", "Extracting information", "Literature data", "Partition coefficient", "Physicochemical property", "Solubility in waters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929340668", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.E.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56320564500": {"Name": "Brumfield M.", "AuthorID": "56320564500", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57215356706": {"Name": "Pipersburgh L.", "AuthorID": "57215356706", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57215360011": {"Name": "Mateja K.", "AuthorID": "57215360011", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56643864800": {"Name": "Dai C.", "AuthorID": "56643864800", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56538081100": {"Name": "Grover D.", "AuthorID": "56538081100", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56643526000": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "56643526000", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
