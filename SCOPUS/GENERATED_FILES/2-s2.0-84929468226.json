Prospective observational study in three facilities providing STI/HIV testing services in Brighton, UK was conducted. Adult MSM attending/contacting a GUM clinic requesting an STI screen (group 1), HIV infectedMSM attending routine outpatient clinic (group 2), and MSM attending a community-based rapid HIV testing service (group 3) were eligible. Participants were required to have no symptomatology consistent with STI and known to be immune to hepatitis A and B (group 1). Eligiblemen were offered a HSK to obtain self-collected specimens as an alternative to routine testing. HSK uptake compared to conventional clinicbased STI/HIV testing in group 1, increase in STI testing rates due to availability of HSK compared to historical controls in group 2 and 3, and HSK return rates in all settings were calculated. Among the 128 eligible men in group 1, HSK acceptance was higher (62.5% (95%CI: 53.5-70.9)) compared to GUM clinic-based testing (37.5% (95% CI: 29.1-46.5)), (p = 0.0004). Two thirds of eligibleMSM offered an HSK in all three groups accepted it, but HSK return rates varied (highest in group 1, 77.5%, lowest in group 3, 16%). HSK for HIV testing was acceptable to 81%of men in group 1. Compared to historical controls, availability of HSK increased the proportion ofMSM testing for STIs in group 2 but not in group 3. HSK for STI/ HIV offers an alternative to conventional clinic-based testing for MSM seeking STI screening. It significantly increases STI testing uptake in HIV infected MSM. HSK could be considered as an adjunct to clinic-based services to further improve STI/HIV testing in MSM.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Delivery of Health Care", "Diagnostic Self Evaluation", "HIV Infections", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Specimen Handling", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929468226", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57203665899": {"Name": "Fisher M.", "AuthorID": "57203665899", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary/HIV Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "25822615600": {"Name": "Perry N.", "AuthorID": "25822615600", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary/HIV Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "9271698500": {"Name": "Richardson D.", "AuthorID": "9271698500", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary/HIV Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55204150900": {"Name": "Dean G.", "AuthorID": "55204150900", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary/HIV Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary/HIV Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "25724754300": {"Name": "Wayal S.", "AuthorID": "25724754300", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "8560546300": {"Name": "Smith H.", "AuthorID": "8560546300", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "8419298800": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.", "AuthorID": "8419298800", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Public Health, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "8668568000": {"Name": "Alexander S.", "AuthorID": "8668568000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory, Virus Reference Department"}, "35592025300": {"Name": "Ison C.", "AuthorID": "35592025300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory, Virus Reference Department"}, "7202279139": {"Name": "Parry J.V.", "AuthorID": "7202279139", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England, Sexually Transmitted Bacteria Reference Laboratory, Virus Reference Department"}, "56647819200": {"Name": "Singleton G.", "AuthorID": "56647819200", "AffiliationID": "60017317, 60079674", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex"}, "7102667804": {"Name": "Bloom G.", "AuthorID": "7102667804", "AffiliationID": "60017317, 60079674", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Development Studies, University of Sussex"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
