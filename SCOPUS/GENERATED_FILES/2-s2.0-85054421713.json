In parallel, modelling of neurological disorders using animals have improved substantially, allowing in depth study of both disease aetiology and the effects of therapeutic agents on such models. In particular, the use of transgenic mouse models has called for high-throughput methods to allow in depth phenotyping of mouse lines, and track disease processes with time. This chapter is dedicated to the use of MRI in small animal models of brain disease, and will describe some of the practical issues surrounding the use of MRI, and review the role of MRI in investigating the pathophysiology of the most common neurological disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Animal model", "Huntington's disease", "Multiple sclerosis", "Parkinson's disease", "Preclinical MRI", "Stroke", "Traumatic brain injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Animal model", "Huntington's disease", "Multiple sclerosis", "Parkinson's disease", "Stroke", "Traumatic Brain Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054421713", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55382681000": {"Name": "Harrison I.", "AuthorID": "55382681000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35220662900": {"Name": "Wells J.", "AuthorID": "35220662900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
