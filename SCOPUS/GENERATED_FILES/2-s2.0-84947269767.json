This paper focuses on the design issues of unloading and loading doors of symmetric-I-shaped (I-LTL) cross-docks pervasive in the Chinese auto-part supplying chain which is obviously a very complex system. First of all, this paper analyzes the operation process of I-LTL cross-docking in detail and completes the construction of discrete event simulation that conforms to I-LTL cross-docking operation on the basis of practical details in reality through ARENA platform. In the simulation analysis, this paper selects the physical flow of parts (supporting for arrival frequency and loading capacity of transport vehicles) and I-LTL cross-docking as the simulation experimental factors and applies multilevel factorial design to carry out a large-scale simulation experiment. The results suggest that the required number of receiving dock doors is determined by the arrival frequency of storage vehicles and loading capacity. Moreover, the effect of arrival frequency index is far greater than the loading capacity index. On the other hand, the required number of shipping dock doors primarily depends on the cross-docking consolidation rate and vehicle arrival frequency. Moreover, the index action of consolidation rate is greater than the effect of arriving frequency linearity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["discrete simulation", "factorial design", "simulation experiment", "Symmetric-I-shaped cross-docking", "system complexity", "unloading and loading dock door"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crossdocking", "Discrete simulations", "Factorial design", "Loading dock", "System complexity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947269767", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"24833198400": {"Name": "Leng K.", "AuthorID": "24833198400", "AffiliationID": "113119597", "AffiliationName": "Research Center of Hubei Logistics Development"}, "55561166400": {"Name": "Shi W.", "AuthorID": "55561166400", "AffiliationID": "113119597", "AffiliationName": "Research Center of Hubei Logistics Development"}, "36655395200": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "36655395200", "AffiliationID": "60108808", "AffiliationName": "School of Business Administration, Hubei University of Economics"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
