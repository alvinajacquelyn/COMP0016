The conventional view is that this occurs in the mid-1980s and the reason is that this is when Mrs. Thatcher implements her package of far-reaching structural reforms. This paper asks whether econometric evidence is supportive of such view. We find it is not and ask what else could have played such a role. We examine an alternative and much less popular hypothesis: this turning point occurs instead in 1973 when the UK finally joined the EU. We find significant econometric support for 1973. We explain this finding by arguing that EU accession marked the victory of the business groups that wanted to compete at the high-tech end of the very demanding common European market against those business groups wanted to compete in the comparative-advantage driven mostly former colonies Commonwealth market. These pro-Europe business groups later become the constituency that supported Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s reforms without which we argue they would not be nearly as successful. We discuss the implications of these findings for Brexit and the EU.", "AuthorKeywords": ["European integration", "UK relative economic performance"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042672418", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7006704860": {"Name": "Campos N.", "AuthorID": "7006704860", "AffiliationID": "60007893", "AffiliationName": "IZA Bonn"}, "57192425824": {"Name": "Coricelli F.", "AuthorID": "57192425824", "AffiliationID": "60016621", "AffiliationName": "CEPR"}}}
