Our aim was to investigate the effect of a novel bioresorbable scaffold, Mirage on local hemodynamics in animal models. Method: The main epicardial coronary arteries of 7 healthy mini-pigs were implanted with 11 Mirage Microfiber sirolimus-eluting Bioresorbable Scaffolds (MMSES). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed post scaffold implantation and the obtained images were fused with angiographic data to reconstruct the coronary artery anatomy. Blood flow simulation was performed and Endothelial Shear Stress(ESS) distribution was estimated for each of the 11 scaffolds. ESS data were extracted in each circumferential 5-degree subunit of each cross-section in the scaffolded segment. The generalized linear mixed-effect analysis was implemented for the comparison of ESS in two scaffold groups; 150-\u00b5m strut thickness MMSES and 125-\u00b5m strut thickness MMSES. Results: ESS was significantly higher in MMSES (150 \u00b5m) [0.85(0.49\u20131.40) Pa], compared to MMSES (125 \u00b5m) [0.68(0.35\u20131.18) Pa]. Both MMSES (150 \u00b5m) and MMSES (125 \u00b5m) revealed low recirculation zone percentages per luminal surface area [3.17% \u00b1 1.97% in MMSES (150 \u00b5m), 2.71% \u00b1 1.32% in MMSES (125 \u00b5m)]. Conclusion: Thinner strut Mirage scaffolds induced lower shear stress due to the small size vessels treated as compared to the thick strut version of the Mirage which was implanted in relatively bigger size vessels. Vessel size should be taken into account in planning BRS implantation. Small vessels may not get benefit from BRS implantation even with a streamlined strut profile. This pilot study warrants comparative assessment with commercially available bioresorbable scaffolds.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioresorbable scaffold", "computational fluid dynamic", "endothelial shear stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorbable Implants", "Animals", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Cardiovascular Agents", "Coated Materials, Biocompatible", "Computer Simulation", "Coronary Circulation", "Coronary Vessels", "Hemodynamics", "Models, Animal", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Prosthesis Design", "Sirolimus", "Stress, Mechanical", "Swine", "Swine, Miniature", "Time Factors", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028296139", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"23669358200": {"Name": "Tenekecioglu E.", "AuthorID": "23669358200", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Thoraxcenter"}, "57140106000": {"Name": "Cavalcante R.", "AuthorID": "57140106000", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Thoraxcenter"}, "56888186000": {"Name": "Zeng Y.", "AuthorID": "56888186000", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Thoraxcenter"}, "15051093400": {"Name": "Onuma Y.", "AuthorID": "15051093400", "AffiliationID": "60032114, 60002794", "AffiliationName": "Department of Interventional Cardiology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Thoraxcenter"}, "34573036500": {"Name": "Serruys P.W.", "AuthorID": "34573036500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, International Centre for Circulatory Health, Imperial College"}, "7005835193": {"Name": "Torii R.", "AuthorID": "7005835193", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University College of London Hospitals"}, "7003845955": {"Name": "Crake T.", "AuthorID": "7003845955", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University College of London Hospitals"}, "57115149800": {"Name": "Sotomi Y.", "AuthorID": "57115149800", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "57189342058": {"Name": "Collet C.", "AuthorID": "57189342058", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "36122299200": {"Name": "Abizaid A.", "AuthorID": "36122299200", "AffiliationID": "60020705", "AffiliationName": "Department of Invasive Cardiology, Institute Dante Pazzanese of Cardiology"}, "57192305567": {"Name": "Su S.", "AuthorID": "57192305567", "AffiliationID": "120644539", "AffiliationName": "DuNing Incorporated"}, "6602353354": {"Name": "Santoso T.", "AuthorID": "6602353354", "AffiliationID": "60069378, 60069377", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo and Medistra Hospitals, University of Indonesia"}}}
