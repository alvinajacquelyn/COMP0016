Using a combination of X-ray powder diffraction and computational methods, the location and orientation of the N,N-diisopropylethylamine molecules inside the cages of the AEI structure were determined. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that the number of template molecules per unit cell was consistent with the diffraction study. We unequivocally show that only one template molecule is present in each cage of the crystalline AEI material. Our work demonstrates that a combined approach enables accurate structure resolution of such complex materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AlPO-18", "Microporous material", "Molecular modeling", "Small pore", "Structure", "Template location", "X-ray diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["AlPO-18", "Complex materials", "Diffraction studies", "Phase pure", "Small pore", "Synthesised", "Template molecules", "X-ray synchrotron diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932084360", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"6507544941": {"Name": "Zenonos C.", "AuthorID": "6507544941", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7404749677": {"Name": "Lewis D.W.", "AuthorID": "7404749677", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
