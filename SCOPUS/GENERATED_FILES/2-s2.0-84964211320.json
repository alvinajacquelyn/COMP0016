It discusses the state education system, which since the military coup of 1962 has promoted the idea of the country based on the language and culture of the Bamar (Burman) majority community, and the school systems developed by ethnic armed groups which oppose the military government. Ethnic opposition education regimes have developed mother tongue-based school systems. In some cases, the Mon for example, these broadly follow the government curriculum, while being locally owned and delivered in ethnic languages; in others, such as the Karen, the local education system diverges significantly from the Myanmar government curriculum, making it difficult for students to transition between the two systems. This article explores the consequences of these developments, and how reforms in Myanmar since 2011 \u2014 including the peace process, which remains incomplete and contested \u2014 have opened the space for educational reform, and the possible \u201cconvergence\u201d of state and non-state education regimes. Ethnic nationality communities remain determined to conserve and reproduce their own languages and cultures, adopting positions in relation to language and education which reflect broader state-society relations in Myanmar, and in particular ethnic politicians\u2019 demands for a federal political settlement to decades of armed conflict. The article concludes that sustainable resolution to Myanmar\u2019s protracted state-society conflict is unlikely to be achieved until elites can negotiate agreement on ethnic language and teaching policies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conflict", "Education", "Language rights", "Mother tongue-based education", "Myanmar/Burma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964211320", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"55223925300": {"Name": "South A.", "AuthorID": "55223925300", "AffiliationID": "60000881", "AffiliationName": "c/o Centre for Ethnic Studies and Development, Faculty of Social Sciences, Chiang Mai University"}, "18134178400": {"Name": "Lall M.", "AuthorID": "18134178400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Education and South Asian Studies, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
