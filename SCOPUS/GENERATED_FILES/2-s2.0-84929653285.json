ATTR V122I is the most common variant associated with non-neuropathic familial amyloid cardiomyopathy. We present an unusual case of V122I amyloidosis with features of amyloid neuropathy and myopathy, supported by histological confirmation in both sites and diffuse tracer uptake on <sup>99m</sup>Tc-3,3-Diphosphono-1,2-Propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) scintigraphy throughout skeletal and cardiac muscle. A 64 year old Jamaican man presented with cardiac failure. Cardiac MR revealed infiltrative cardiomyopathy; abdominal fat aspirate confirmed the presence of amyloid, and he was homozygous for the V122I variant of transthyretin. He also described general weakness and EMG demonstrated myopathic features. Sural nerve and vastus lateralis biopsy showed TTR amyloid. The patient is being treated with diflunisal, an oral TTR stabilising agent. Symptomatic myopathy and neuropathy with confirmation of tissue amyloid deposition has not previously been described. Extracardiac amyloidosis has implications for diagnosis and treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiomyopathy", "Hereditary amyloidosis", "Myopathy", "Neuropathy", "Transthyretin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Myocardium", "Peripheral Nervous System Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929653285", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"36183183600": {"Name": "Carr A.S.", "AuthorID": "36183183600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "37073184700": {"Name": "Pelayo-Negro A.L.", "AuthorID": "37073184700", "AffiliationID": "60020591", "AffiliationName": "Univ.
