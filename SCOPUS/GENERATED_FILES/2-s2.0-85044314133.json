(2016) [2], http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrep.2016.06.022), which presents that TGF-\u03b2 increased CUX1 binding in the proximal promoter and enhancer of the COL1A2 and regulated COL1. Further, in the scleroderma (SSc) lung and diffuse alveolar damage lung sections, CUX1 localized within the \u03b1- smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) positive cells (Fragiadaki et al., 2011) [1], \u201cHigh doses of TGF-beta potently suppress type I collagen via the transcription factor CUX1\u201d (Ikeda et al., 2016) [2]. Here we show that CUX1 isoforms are localized within \u03b1-smooth muscle actin-positive cells in SSc skin and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) lung tissue sections. In particular, at the granular and prickle cell layers in the SSc skin sections, CUX1 and \u03b1-SMA are co-localized. In addition, at the fibrotic loci in the IPF lung tissue sections, CUX1 localized within the \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) positive cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044314133", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7404133295": {"Name": "Ikeda T.", "AuthorID": "7404133295", "AffiliationID": "60000088", "AffiliationName": "Kochi Medical School"}, "6602707389": {"Name": "Shi-wen X.", "AuthorID": "6602707389", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University College Medical School"}, "6602769002": {"Name": "Ponticos M.", "AuthorID": "6602769002", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University College Medical School"}, "15746876300": {"Name": "Khan K.", "AuthorID": "15746876300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University College Medical School"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University College Medical School"}, "57188630860": {"Name": "Garcia P.", "AuthorID": "57188630860", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University College Medical School"}, "57203195982": {"Name": "Abraham D.", "AuthorID": "57203195982", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University College Medical School"}, "6505478923": {"Name": "Fragiadaki M.", "AuthorID": "6505478923", "AffiliationID": "60175990", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College School of Medicine"}, "7004519069": {"Name": "Bou-Gharios G.", "AuthorID": "7004519069", "AffiliationID": "60175990", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College School of Medicine"}, "57201573066": {"Name": "Yamakawa A.", "AuthorID": "57201573066", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "University of Tokyo, Institute of Medical Science"}, "7102275791": {"Name": "Morimoto C.", "AuthorID": "7102275791", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "University of Tokyo, Institute of Medical Science"}}}
