Two stars with previously observed Zeeman splitting, WD0322-019 and WD2105-820, are detected above 5s and \u3008Bz\u3009> 1 kG, while WD1145+017, WD1929+011, and WD2326+049 yield (null) detections below this minimum level of confidence. For these latter three stars, high-resolution spectra and atmospheric modelling are used to obtain limits on magnetic field strengths via the absence of Zeeman splitting, finding B* < 20 kG based on data with resolving power R \u2248 40 000. An analytical framework is presented for bulk Earth composition material falling on to the magnetic polar regions of white dwarfs, where X-rays and cyclotron radiation may contribute to accretion luminosity. This analysis is applied to X-ray data for WD1145+017, WD1729+371, and WD2326+049, and the upper bound count rates are modelled with spectra for a range of plasma kT = 1-10 keV in both the magnetic and non-magnetic accretion regimes. The results for all three stars are consistent with a typical dusty white dwarf in a steady state at 108-109 g s-1. In particular, the non-magnetic limits for WD1145+017 are found to be well below previous estimates of up to 1012 g s-1, and likely below 1010 g s-1, thus suggesting the star-disc system may be average in its evolutionary state, and only special in viewing geometry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circumstellar matter", "Planetary systems", "Stars: magnetic field", "White dwarfs", "X-rays: stars"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046033727", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57203394181": {"Name": "Farihi J.", "AuthorID": "57203394181", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6602674743": {"Name": "Achilleos N.", "AuthorID": "6602674743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23392434700": {"Name": "Fossati L.", "AuthorID": "23392434700", "AffiliationID": "60020103, 60003156", "AffiliationName": "Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "7006472130": {"Name": "Wheatley P.J.", "AuthorID": "7006472130", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "7004303221": {"Name": "G\u00e4nsicke B.T.", "AuthorID": "7004303221", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "16304910300": {"Name": "Metzger B.D.", "AuthorID": "16304910300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Columbia University"}, "8567321700": {"Name": "Mauerhan J.", "AuthorID": "8567321700", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of California"}, "57200294268": {"Name": "Bachman S.", "AuthorID": "57200294268", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department and Van Vleck Observatory, Wesleyan University"}, "6603699060": {"Name": "Redfield S.", "AuthorID": "6603699060", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department and Van Vleck Observatory, Wesleyan University"}, "55340025300": {"Name": "Cauley P.W.", "AuthorID": "55340025300", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Astronomy Department and Van Vleck Observatory, Wesleyan University"}, "23008795500": {"Name": "Kochukhov O.", "AuthorID": "23008795500", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University"}, "56730033700": {"Name": "Stone N.", "AuthorID": "56730033700", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Columbia University"}}}
