Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Parkin related Parkinson's disease (PD) is differentiated from idiopathic PD by absent or sparse Lewy bodies, and preserved olfaction. The significance of single Parkin mutations in the pathogenesis of PD is debated. Objectives: To assess olfaction results according to Parkin mutation status. To compare the prevalence of Parkin single heterozygous mutations in patients diagnosed with PD to the rate in healthy controls in order to establish whether these single mutations could be a risk factor for developing PD. Methods: Parkin gene mutation testing was performed in young onset PD (diagnosed <50 years old) to identify three groups: Parkin homozygous or compound heterozygote mutation carriers, Parkin single heterozygote mutation carriers, and non-carriers of Parkin mutations. Olfaction was tested using the 40-item British version of the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test (UPSIT). Results: Of 344 young onset PD cases tested, 8 (2.3%) were Parkin compound heterozygotes and 13 (3.8%) were Parkin single heterozygotes. Olfaction results were available in 282 cases (eight compound heterozygotes, nine single heterozygotes, and 265 non-carriers). In Parkin compound heterozygotes, the median UPSIT score was 33, interquartile range (IQR) 28.5\u201336.5, which was significantly better than in single Parkin heterozygotes (median 19, IQR 18\u201328) and non-carriers (median score 22, IQR 16\u201328) (ANOVA P < 0.001). These differences persisted after adjusting for age, disease duration, gender, and smoking (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in UPSIT scores between single heterozygotes and non-carriers (P = 0.90). Conclusions: Patients with Parkin compound heterozygous mutations have relatively preserved olfaction compared to Parkin single heterozygotes and non-carriers. The prevalence of Parkin single heterozygosity is similar to the 3.7% rate reported in healthy controls.", "AuthorKeywords": ["genetics", "olfaction", "Parkin", "Parkinson's disease", "University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification test"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age of Onset", "Aged", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "DNA", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parkinson Disease", "Prevalence", "Smell", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991704805", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36727900800": {"Name": "Malek N.", "AuthorID": "36727900800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56007117800": {"Name": "Swallow D.M.A.", "AuthorID": "56007117800", "AffiliationID": "60117212", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "6506382805": {"Name": "Grosset K.A.", "AuthorID": "6506382805", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57189626701": {"Name": "Smith C.R.", "AuthorID": "57189626701", "AffiliationID": "60117212", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "7005989891": {"Name": "Grosset D.G.", "AuthorID": "7005989891", "AffiliationID": "60117212", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurological Sciences, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "57202798417": {"Name": "Lawton M.A.", "AuthorID": "57202798417", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social & Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7006649063": {"Name": "Ben-Shlomo Y.", "AuthorID": "7006649063", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social & Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "6603851732": {"Name": "Bajaj N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603851732", "AffiliationID": "60030816", "AffiliationName": "Queen's Medical Centre"}, "57198363260": {"Name": "Barker R.A.", "AuthorID": "57198363260", "AffiliationID": "60120904", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences, John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair"}, "57031788200": {"Name": "Bresner C.", "AuthorID": "57031788200", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University"}, "7402772034": {"Name": "Williams N.", "AuthorID": "7402772034", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University"}, "26034521700": {"Name": "Burn D.J.", "AuthorID": "26034521700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University College London"}, "7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.W.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57191583085": {"Name": "Swallow D.M.A.", "AuthorID": "57191583085", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55599815100": {"Name": "Lawton M.A.", "AuthorID": "55599815100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57207216136": {"Name": "Smith C.R.", "AuthorID": "57207216136", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "36795415800": {"Name": "Bajaj N.P.", "AuthorID": "36795415800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7202725784": {"Name": "Barker R.A.", "AuthorID": "7202725784", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57218682628": {"Name": "Ben-Shlomo Y.", "AuthorID": "57218682628", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57191571379": {"Name": "Bresner C.", "AuthorID": "57191571379", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57215196433": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "57215196433", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57207710949": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "57207710949", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55434895700": {"Name": "Williams N.", "AuthorID": "55434895700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57212629714": {"Name": "Wood N.W.", "AuthorID": "57212629714", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57198035038": {"Name": "Grosset D.G.", "AuthorID": "57198035038", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
