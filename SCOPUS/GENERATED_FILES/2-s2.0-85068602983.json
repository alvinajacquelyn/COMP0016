The evolution of the solid-state chemistry taking place in the oxygen carrier material was investigated in real-time with synchrotron X-ray diffraction while the spatial distribution of the phases was investigated using X-ray diffraction computed tomography (XRD-CT). These measurements revealed that some Fe-cations were systematically taken up and released from the spinel support. This take-up and release was shown to be strongly related with the oxidation state of the active phase. Although this take-up and release of Fe-cations decreased the amount of Fe-oxides active in the chemical looping process, the oxygen transfer capacity was still sufficiently high. The microstructure of the oxygen carriers along the length of the packed reactor bed was also investigated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The experiments indicate that the MgFeAlOx support with an extra Fe-based active phase is a promising material for oxygen carriers, as it forms a sustainable non-toxic, stable and green alternative to the typical Ni-based oxygen carriers, for hydrogen generation by chemical looping.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemical looping", "Diffraction tomography", "Iron oxide", "Oxygen carrier"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical looping", "Chemical-looping process", "Diffraction tomography", "Fe-based oxygen carriers", "Hydrogen generations", "Oxygen Carrier", "Solid state chemistry", "Synchrotron x ray diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068602983", "SubjectAreas": [["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57191858344": {"Name": "De Vos Y.", "AuthorID": "57191858344", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Textiles and Chemical Engineering, Industrial Catalysis and Adsorption Technology (INCAT), Ghent University"}, "7402487881": {"Name": "Jacobs M.", "AuthorID": "7402487881", "AffiliationID": "60019342", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Materials Management, Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO)"}, "23393234400": {"Name": "Middelkoop V.", "AuthorID": "23393234400", "AffiliationID": "60019342", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Materials Management, Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO)"}, "56743361600": {"Name": "Vamvakeros A.", "AuthorID": "56743361600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7101952456": {"Name": "Jacques S.", "AuthorID": "7101952456", "AffiliationID": "60170282", "AffiliationName": "Finden ltd."}, "57200512487": {"Name": "Matras D.", "AuthorID": "57200512487", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7006404365": {"Name": "Van Der Voort P.", "AuthorID": "7006404365", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Center for Ordered Materials, Organometallics and Catalysis (COMOC), Faculty of Sciences, Ghent University"}, "7003855276": {"Name": "Van Driessche I.", "AuthorID": "7003855276", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Sol-gel Centre for Research on Inorganic Powders and Thin films Synthesis (SCRiPTS), Faculty of Sciences, Ghent University"}, "6603199684": {"Name": "Verberckmoes A.", "AuthorID": "6603199684", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Textiles and Chemical Engineering, Industrial Catalysis and Adsorption Technology (INCAT), Ghent University"}}}
