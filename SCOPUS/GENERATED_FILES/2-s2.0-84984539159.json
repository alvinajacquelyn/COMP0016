Moving mesh methods can address this by distributing mesh nodes to minimise the number of nodes needed to represent a waveform. In this paper, a monitor function is presented which is designed specifically for spectral moving mesh methods. In comparison with past monitor functions, this new monitor function significantly improves the convergence rate of the spectral moving mesh method when applied to Burgers' equation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984539159", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56043355700": {"Name": "Wise E.", "AuthorID": "56043355700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
