Core to the issues addressed in this book is the idea of how volcanic crisis communication operates in practice and in theory. This chapter provides an overview of the evolution of thinking around the importance of volcanic crisis communication over the last century, bringing together studies on relevant case studies. Frequently, the mechanisms by which volcanic crisis communication occurs are via a number of key tools employed including: risk assessment, probabilistic analysis, early-warning systems, all of which assist in the decision-making procedures; that are compounded by ever-changing societal demands and needs. This chapter outlines some of the key challenges faced in managing responses to volcanic eruptions since the start of the 20th century, to explore what has been effective, what lessons have been learnt from key events, and what solutions we can discover. Adopting a holistic approach, this chapter aims to provide a contextual background for the following chapters in the volume that explore many of the elements discussed here in further detail. Finally, we consider the future, as many chapters in this book bring together a wealth of new knowledge that will enable further insights for investigation, experimentation, and development of future volcanic crisis communication.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062995566", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"8869544900": {"Name": "Fearnley C.", "AuthorID": "8869544900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}, "56636365800": {"Name": "Winson A.E.G.", "AuthorID": "56636365800", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, Aberystwyth University"}, "7003483269": {"Name": "Pallister J.", "AuthorID": "7003483269", "AffiliationID": "60030877, 60011347", "AffiliationName": "U.S. Geological Survey, David A, Johnston Cascades Volcano Observatory"}, "6604052475": {"Name": "Tilling R.", "AuthorID": "6604052475", "AffiliationID": "60017521", "AffiliationName": "U.S. Geological Survey, Volcano Science Center"}}}
