However, it has proven to be a challenging task due to the presence of Kerr effects, which have largely been regarded as a major bottleneck for enhancing the achievable information rates in modern optical communications. In this work, the optimisation and performance of digital nonlinearity compensation are discussed for maximising the achievable information rates in spectrally-efficient optical fibre communication systems. It is found that, for any given target information rate, there exists a trade-off between modulation format and compensated bandwidth to reduce the computational complexity requirement of digital nonlinearity compensation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["achievable information rate", "digital back-propagation", "digital nonlinearity compensation", "modulation format", "optical communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable information rate", "High capacity", "Information rates", "Kerr effects", "Modulation formats", "Non-linearity compensation", "Optimisations", "Target information"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046457595", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Connected Systems Group, School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "57090027300": {"Name": "Shevchenko N.", "AuthorID": "57090027300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194377945": {"Name": "Karanov B.", "AuthorID": "57194377945", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56114715000": {"Name": "Liga G.", "AuthorID": "56114715000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
