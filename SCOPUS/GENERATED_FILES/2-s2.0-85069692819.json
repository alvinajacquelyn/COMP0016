The molecular mechanisms involving G1/S transcriptional regulation are well established and have been shown to be evolutionary conserved from yeast to humans. Previous work has suggested that changes to the chromatin state, specifically through histone acetylation, has an important role in the regulation of G1/S transcription in both yeast and human cells. Here we investigate the role of histone acetylation in G1/S transcriptional regulation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our work shows that histone acetylation at specific sites at G1/S target gene promoters peaks at the G1-to-S transition, coinciding with their peak transcription levels. Acetylation at G1/S target promoters is significantly reduced upon deletion of the previously implicated histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, but G1/S cell cycle regulated transcription is largely unaffected. The histone deacetylase Rpd3, suggested to have a role in Whi5-dependent repression, is required for full repression of G1/S target genes in the G1 and S phases. However, in the context of transcriptionally active levels during the G1-to-S transition, this seems to play a minor role in the regulation of cell cycle transcription. Our data suggests that histone acetylation might modulate the amplitude of G1/S cell cycle regulated transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but has a limited role in its overall regulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylation", "Cell Cycle", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Histone Acetyltransferases", "Histone Deacetylases", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "S Phase", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069692819", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57194458126": {"Name": "Kishkevich A.", "AuthorID": "57194458126", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}, "57210161360": {"Name": "Cooke S.L.", "AuthorID": "57210161360", "AffiliationID": "60010269, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology University College London"}, "57199106257": {"Name": "Harris M.R.A.", "AuthorID": "57199106257", "AffiliationID": "60010269, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology University College London"}, "7006222988": {"Name": "de Bruin R.A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006222988", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
