Currently, patient management is suboptimal due to using subjective patient reported episodes to answer these questions. Methodology: Clinical and real environment sensor data (memory, tapping, walking) was provided by the mPower study (6805 participants). From the data, we derived relevant clinical scenarios: S1) before vs. after initiating pharmacotherapy, and S2) before vs. after taking medication. For each scenario we designed and tested 6 methods of supervised classification. Precision, Accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) were computed using 10-fold cross-validation. Results: The best classification models were: S1) Decision Trees on Tapping activity data (AUC 0.95, 95% CI 0.05); and S2) K-Nearest Neighbours on Gait data (mean AUC 0.70, 95% CI 0.07, 46% participants with AUC > 0.70). Conclusions: Automatic patient classification based on sensor activity data can objectively inform PD medication management, with significant potential for improving patient care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Machine learning", "Parkinson's disease", "Pharmacotherapy", "Supervised classification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gait", "Humans", "Medication Therapy Management", "Parkinson Disease", "Walking", "Wearable Electronic Devices"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046547954", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"57201942712": {"Name": "Nguyen V.", "AuthorID": "57201942712", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "7202518992": {"Name": "Kunz H.", "AuthorID": "7202518992", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "7404775085": {"Name": "Taylor P.", "AuthorID": "7404775085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "12752676200": {"Name": "Acosta D.", "AuthorID": "12752676200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
