This paper focuses on automated PCa classification on VERDICT (Vascular, Extracellular and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumors) diffusion weighted (DW)-MRI, which is a non-invasive microstructural imaging technique that comprises a rich imaging protocol and a tissue computational model to map in vivo histological indices. The contribution of the paper is two fold. Firstly, we investigate the potential of automated, model-free PCa classification on raw VERDICT DW-MRI. Secondly, we attempt to adapt and evaluate novel fully convolutional neural networks (FCNNs) for PCa characterization. We present two neural network architectures that adapt U-Net and ResNet-18 to the PCa classification problem. We train the networks end-to-end on DW-MRI data and evaluate the diagnostic performance employing a 10-fold cross validation approach using data acquired from 103 patients. ResNet-18 outperforms U-Net with an average AUC of 86.7 %. Our results show promise for the utilization of raw VERDICT DW-MRI data and FCNNs for automating the PCa diagnostic pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Convolutional neural networks", "Prostate cancer classification", "VERDICT MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["10-fold cross-validation", "Computational model", "Convolutional neural network", "Diagnostic performance", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)", "Non-invasive imaging", "Prostate cancers", "Restricted diffusion"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054490570", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57193683957": {"Name": "Chiou E.", "AuthorID": "57193683957", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL"}, "9250105400": {"Name": "Kokkinos I.", "AuthorID": "9250105400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, UCL"}, "36026988600": {"Name": "Panagiotaki E.", "AuthorID": "36026988600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL"}, "55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL"}, "53866162900": {"Name": "Bonet-Carne E.", "AuthorID": "53866162900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}}}
