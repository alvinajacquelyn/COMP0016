Using conventional confocal fluorescence lifetime imaging, we show that it is possible to deliver down to 6 nm axial position sensitivity of fluorophores in whole biological cell imaging. We employ this technique to map the topography of the cellular membrane, and demonstrate its application in an investigation of receptor-mediated endocytosis in carcinoma cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Endocytosis", "Fluorescence", "Gold", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Humans", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Nanostructures", "Neoplasms", "Receptors, CXCR4"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930032877", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"8984284300": {"Name": "Cade N.I.", "AuthorID": "8984284300", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute"}, "6603669293": {"Name": "Krasavin A.V.", "AuthorID": "6603669293", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King's College London Strand"}, "55259634800": {"Name": "Richards D.", "AuthorID": "55259634800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King's College London Strand"}, "6507547753": {"Name": "Fruhwirth G.O.", "AuthorID": "6507547753", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging Chemistry and Biology, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "7402229941": {"Name": "Ng T.", "AuthorID": "7402229941", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Richard Dimbleby Department of Cancer Research, Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}}}
