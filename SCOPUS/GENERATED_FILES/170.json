Journal of Flood Risk Management published by The Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Interviews with 304 households were used to determine flood risk reduction measures adopted in the case study of the Becva River in the Czech Republic. Uptake of measures was low, irrespective of experience with floods. Financial cost seemed to be a barrier towards implementation, but more work is needed to understand the combination of factors limiting adoption of household flood risk reduction measures. Regression analysis indicated that socio-demographic factors play an important role in household decision making. More men and more children in a household support the adoption of measures. Perception of living in a flood risk zone, rather than actual experience of flooding, also positively influenced probability of adopting some measures. When a house is elevated up from ground level by 1 metre or more, the likelihood of taking further measures decreased by 20%. Further investigation of these factors and why, not just how, they influence household choices would support flood risk reduction measures, especially under a changing climate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Becva River Basin", "Czech Republic", "flood damage", "flood risk", "flood risk management", "household measures", "river floods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921518599", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"]], "AuthorData": {"55875148600": {"Name": "Du\u017e\u00ed B.", "AuthorID": "55875148600", "AffiliationID": "60004261", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Agronomy, Mendel University"}, "55972402700": {"Name": "Vikhrov D.", "AuthorID": "55972402700", "AffiliationID": "60170320, 60029504, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "CERGE-EI, joint workplace of Charles University in Prague and the Economics Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60028086", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI)"}, "36996698400": {"Name": "Stojanov R.", "AuthorID": "36996698400", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Geography & Regional Development, Faculty of Science, Charles University"}, "56015582100": {"Name": "Ju\u0159i\u010dka D.", "AuthorID": "56015582100", "AffiliationID": "60004261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology and Pedology, Mendel University"}}}
