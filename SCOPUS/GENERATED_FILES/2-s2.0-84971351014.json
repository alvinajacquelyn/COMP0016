All rights reserved.An ordered macroporous host (mac-SiO2) has been used to prevent aggregation of layered photocatalysts based on carbon nitride. Using typical carbon nitride synthesis conditions, cyanamide was condensed at 550 \u00b0C in the presence and absence of mac-SiO2. Condensation in the absence of mac-SiO2 results in materials with structural characteristics consistent with the carbon nitride, melon, accompanied by ca. 2 wt% carbonization. For mac-SiO2 supported materials, condensation occurs with greater carbonization (ca. 6 wt%). On addition of 3 wt% Pt cocatalyst photocatalytic hydrogen production under visible light is found to be up to 10 times greater for the supported composites. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that excited state relaxation is more rapid for the mac-SiO2 supported materials suggesting faster electron-hole recombination and that supported carbon nitride does not exhibit improved charge separation. CO2 temperature programmed desorption indicates that enhanced photoactivity of supported carbon nitride is attributable to an increased surface area compared to bulk carbon nitride and an increase in the concentration of weakly basic catalytic sites, consistent with carbon nitride oligomers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Confinement effects", "Electron-hole recombination", "Excited state relaxation", "Photocatalytic hydrogen production", "Structural characteristics", "Supported materials", "Synthesis conditions", "Time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971351014", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57189459377": {"Name": "Qiao S.", "AuthorID": "57189459377", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "57189467889": {"Name": "Mitchell R.", "AuthorID": "57189467889", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "56583971200": {"Name": "Coulson B.", "AuthorID": "56583971200", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "57147901200": {"Name": "Jowett D.", "AuthorID": "57147901200", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "7004562085": {"Name": "Douthwaite R.", "AuthorID": "7004562085", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of York"}, "56918657500": {"Name": "Johnson B.", "AuthorID": "56918657500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Research, School of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "56220539800": {"Name": "Brydson R.", "AuthorID": "56220539800", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Research, School of Chemical and Process Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7405628120": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "7405628120", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}}}
