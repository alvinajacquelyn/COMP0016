The aims of this review are to (a) characterize the current state of the field of research on misophonia, (b) highlight what can be inferred from the small research literature to inform treatment of individuals with misophonia, and (c) outline an agenda for research on this topic. We extend previous reviews on this topic by critically reviewing the research investigating mechanisms of misophonia and differences between misophonia and other conditions. In addition, we integrate this small but growing literature with basic and applied research from other literatures in a cross-disciplinary manner.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Defensive motivational systems", "Emotion regulation", "Fear circuitry", "Misophonia", "Sensory over-responsivity", "Sensory processing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041821385", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57200600095": {"Name": "Brout J.J.", "AuthorID": "57200600095", "AffiliationID": "120202736", "AffiliationName": "International Misophonia Research Network"}, "55763859000": {"Name": "Edelstein M.", "AuthorID": "55763859000", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Center for Brain and Cognition, University of California, San Diego"}, "57194427579": {"Name": "Erfanian M.", "AuthorID": "57194427579", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "7404985287": {"Name": "Miller L.J.", "AuthorID": "7404985287", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Brain and Cognition, Amsterdam University"}, "7405772355": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "7405772355", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Auditory Group, Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University"}, "57190868646": {"Name": "Rosenthal M.Z.", "AuthorID": "57190868646", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University"}, "56927990800": {"Name": "Mannino M.", "AuthorID": "56927990800", "AffiliationID": "60017606", "AffiliationName": "Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences, Florida Atlantic University"}, "6603024841": {"Name": "Rouw R.", "AuthorID": "6603024841", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Amsterdam"}}}
