All rights reserved.Pulmonary sequestration (PMS) is a rare bronchopulmonary malformation. It has an incidence of between 0.15% to 1.7%. Likewise, cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is another relatively rare category of a bronchopulmonary malformation with a reported incidence of between 1 in 25,000 to 1 in 35,000. Moreover, a bronchopulmonary malformation with features allied to both of these forms is considered an even rarer entity. In general, bronchopulmonary malformations present with a range of nonspecific symptoms. Radiological features can be non-specific yet distinctive when related to clinical features. Ultimately, definitive diagnosis depends upon histological assessment of lung tissue. We present an adult female with radiological features of both pulmonary sequestration and cystic adenomatoid malformation. This was an incidental finding unrelated to the patients presenting complaint. This case highlights the importance of using a structured and systematic approach when interpreting medical imagery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bronchopulmonary foregut malformation", "Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation", "Extralobar pulmonary sequestration", "Intralobar pulmonary sequestration", "Pulmonary sequestration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Adult", "Bronchopulmonary Sequestration", "Colonoscopy", "Computed Tomography Angiography", "Crohn Disease", "Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of Lung, Congenital", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Incidental Findings", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018946822", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57193230849": {"Name": "Mahmood H.", "AuthorID": "57193230849", "AffiliationID": "60006592", "AffiliationName": "Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "14834275900": {"Name": "Plumb A.", "AuthorID": "14834275900", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College Hospital"}, "26027633500": {"Name": "Vega R.", "AuthorID": "26027633500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal services, University College Hospital"}, "7007026011": {"Name": "Windsor A.", "AuthorID": "7007026011", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal services, University College Hospital"}}}
