However, a subgroup of patients displays above average IQ pre-onset. The nature of these patients' illness and its relationship to typical schizophrenia is not well understood. The current study sought to investigate the symptom profile of high-IQ schizophrenia patients. Methods: We identified 29schizophrenia patients of exceptionally high pre-morbid intelligence (mean estimated pre-morbid intelligence quotient (IQ) of 120), of whom around half also showed minimal decline (less than 10 IQ points) from their estimated pre-morbid IQ. We compared their symptom scores (SAPS, SANS, OPCRIT, MADRS, GAF, SAI-E) with a comparison group of schizophrenia patients of typical IQ using multinomial logistic regression. Results: The patients with very high pre-morbid IQ had significantly lower scores on negative and disorganised symptoms than typical patients (RRR. =. 0.019; 95% CI. =. 0.001, 0.675, P=. 0.030), and showed better global functioning and insight (RRR. =. 1.082; 95% CI. =. 1.020, 1.148; P=. 0.009). Those with a minimal post-onset IQ decline also showed higher levels of manic symptoms (RRR. =. 8.213; 95% CI. =. 1.042, 64.750, P=. 0.046). Conclusions: These findings provide evidence for the existence of a high-IQ variant of schizophrenia that is associated with markedly fewer negative symptoms than typical schizophrenia, and lends support to the idea of a psychosis spectrum or continuum over boundaried diagnostic categories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive function", "IQ", "Psychosis", "Schizophrenia", "Superphrenia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognition", "Female", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Intelligence Tests", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931574562", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55894916400": {"Name": "\u010cernis E.", "AuthorID": "55894916400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "55961024500": {"Name": "Vassos E.", "AuthorID": "55961024500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "35406239400": {"Name": "Murray R.", "AuthorID": "35406239400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7402606754": {"Name": "David A.", "AuthorID": "7402606754", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7003607616": {"Name": "MacCabe J.", "AuthorID": "7003607616", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7003439865": {"Name": "Br\u00e9bion G.", "AuthorID": "7003439865", "AffiliationID": "60104561", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Research and Development, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, CIBERSAM"}, "57200754314": {"Name": "McKenna P.", "AuthorID": "57200754314", "AffiliationID": "60104561, 60081003", "AffiliationName": "Benito Menni CASM, CIBERSAM"}}}
