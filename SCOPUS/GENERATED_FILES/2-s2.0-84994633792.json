As delirium and dementia are strongly related, studies on patients with delirium may give pathophysiological clues. Objective: To determine whether the Alzheimer's disease (AD) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-\u03b2 1-42 (A\u03b242), total tau (T-tau), and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) are associated with delirium in hip fracture patients with and without dementia. Methods: CSF was collected in conjunction to spinal anesthesia in 129 patients. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method once daily in all patients, both pre- and postoperatively. The diagnosis of dementia at admission was based upon clinical consensus. CSF levels of A\u03b242, T-tau, and P-tau were analyzed. Results: In patients without dementia, we found lower CSF A\u03b242 levels (median, 310ng/L versus 489ng/L, p=0.006), higher T-tau levels (median, 505ng/L versus 351ng/L, p=0.02), but no change in P-tau in patients who developed delirium (n=16) compared to those who remained lucid (n=49). Delirious patients also had lower ratios of A\u03b242 to T-tau (p<0.001) and P-tau (p=0.001) relative to those without delirium. CSF A\u03b242 and T-tau remained significantly associated with delirium status in adjusted analyses. In patients with dementia, CSF biomarker levels did not differ between those with (n=54) and without delirium (n=10). Conclusion: The reduction in CSF A\u03b242, indicating \u03b2-amyloidosis, and increase in T-tau, indicating neurodegeneration, in hip fracture patients without dementia developing delirium indicates that preclinical AD brain pathology is clinically relevant and possibly plays a role in delirium pathophysiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "biomarkers", "cerebrospinal fluid", "delirium", "dementia", "physiopathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Delirium", "Dementia", "Female", "Hip Fractures", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "tau Proteins", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994633792", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56798381200": {"Name": "Idland A.", "AuthorID": "56798381200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Research Group for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo"}, "7006685915": {"Name": "Wyller T.", "AuthorID": "7006685915", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "55946965200": {"Name": "Watne L.", "AuthorID": "55946965200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo"}, "56211915000": {"Name": "Bogdanovic N.", "AuthorID": "56211915000", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "6603569408": {"Name": "Br\u00e6khus A.", "AuthorID": "6603569408", "AffiliationID": "60080270", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Ageing and Health, Vestfold Hospital Trust"}, "57193827870": {"Name": "Stoen R.", "AuthorID": "57193827870", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, Oslo University Hospital"}, "7006027919": {"Name": "R\u00e6der J.", "AuthorID": "7006027919", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "7004092773": {"Name": "Eri L.", "AuthorID": "7004092773", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Oslo University Hospital"}, "6603211270": {"Name": "Frihagen F.", "AuthorID": "6603211270", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Oslo University Hospital"}, "7006577468": {"Name": "Chaudhry F.", "AuthorID": "7006577468", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Skane University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg"}}}
