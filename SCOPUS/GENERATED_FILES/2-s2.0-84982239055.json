Thus, PM colouration is induced by position selectivity, and therefore, a dynamic volumetric display may be realised using these two control lights. Moreover, a mixture of multiple PM types with different absorption properties exhibits different colours depending on the control light spectrum. Particularly, the spectrum management of the control light allows colour-selective colouration besides position selectivity. Therefore, a PM-based, full-colour volumetric display is realised. We experimentally construct a mixture of two PM types and validate the operating principles of such a volumetric display system. Our system is constructed simply by mixing multiple PM types; therefore, the display hardware structure is extremely simple, and the minimum size of a volume element can be as small as the size of a molecule. Volumetric displays can provide natural three-dimensional (3D) perception; therefore, the potential uses of our system include high-definition 3D visualisation for medical applications, architectural design, human-computer interactions, advertising, and entertainment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982239055", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55857904100": {"Name": "Hirayama R.", "AuthorID": "55857904100", "AffiliationID": "60015540", "AffiliationName": "Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}, "35279839800": {"Name": "Kakue T.", "AuthorID": "35279839800", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University"}, "6603199127": {"Name": "Shimobaba T.", "AuthorID": "6603199127", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University"}, "56102564500": {"Name": "Ito T.", "AuthorID": "56102564500", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Engineering, Chiba University"}, "9737787100": {"Name": "Shiraki A.", "AuthorID": "9737787100", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Management and Information Technologies, Chiba University"}, "7102482642": {"Name": "Naruse M.", "AuthorID": "7102482642", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "Network System Research Institute, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"}, "57202768975": {"Name": "Nakamura S.", "AuthorID": "57202768975", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "Innovation Center, RIKEN"}, "24176114000": {"Name": "Nakayama H.", "AuthorID": "24176114000", "AffiliationID": "60029701", "AffiliationName": "Center for Computational Astrophysics, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan"}}}
