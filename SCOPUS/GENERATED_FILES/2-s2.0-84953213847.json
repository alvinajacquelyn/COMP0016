Construction of the NOvA experiment, situated off-axis in the upgraded NuMI beam, is almost complete. Over the coming years it will have significant power to probe the questions of the mass hierarchy, \u03b823 octant, and the possibility of CP violation in the lepton sector. This paper gives an overview of the results from MINOS, and of the sensitivity of the NO\u03bdA experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric neutrinos", "CP violations", "Mass hierarchy", "Neutrino mass", "NuMI beam", "Off-axis", "Precise measurements"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953213847", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57192214384": {"Name": "Backhouse C.", "AuthorID": "57192214384", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "California Institute of Technology"}}}
