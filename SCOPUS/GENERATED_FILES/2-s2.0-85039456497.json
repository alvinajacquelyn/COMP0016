Samples consisting of either pure PDMS or CNT-loaded PDMS were characterised to determine the influence of CNTs on the speed of sound and power-law acoustic attenuation parameters. A small weight fraction (< 1.8%) of added CNTs was found to yield a prominent increase in the exponent of the power law, resulting in a significant increase in acoustic attenuation at higher frequencies. The speed of sound was found to be nearly identical, however. These results could prove useful in the numerical modelling and design of future optical ultrasound sources based on CNT-loaded PDMS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustical attenuation", "Acoustical characterisation", "Carbon nanotubes", "Optical ultrasound generator", "Polydimethylsiloxane"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039456497", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"24922600100": {"Name": "Alles E.", "AuthorID": "24922600100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56150220800": {"Name": "Colchester R.", "AuthorID": "56150220800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57132035600": {"Name": "Heo J.", "AuthorID": "57132035600", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University"}, "36024934800": {"Name": "Baac H.", "AuthorID": "36024934800", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University"}, "36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
