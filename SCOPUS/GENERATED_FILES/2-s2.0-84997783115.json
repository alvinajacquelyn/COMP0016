A secondary aim was to explore whether it can reduce returns to prison. Between 2011 and 2014, a total of 2115 young prisoners were screened, 94 (4.4%) met criteria for ultra-high risk for psychosis and were offered an intervention, 52 actually received it. Return to prison data were sought on the 52 participants, receiving a formal intervention. Of the 52 prisoners who received an intervention, 30.8% returned to custody compared to national average reconviction rates of between 45.4 and 66.5%. Our results suggest that early detection is a feasible option in a prison setting, improving mental health outcomes and reducing returns to prison. Mental health outcomes were recorded for a sub-sample of those receiving the intervention. The results indicated statistically significant improvements on measures of depression, anxiety and psychological distress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early intervention", "offenders", "prison", "psychosis", "psychotic symptoms", "ultra-high risk"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997783115", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57192109598": {"Name": "Evans C.", "AuthorID": "57192109598", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35605583800": {"Name": "Forrester A.", "AuthorID": "35605583800", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005047877": {"Name": "Jarrett M.", "AuthorID": "7005047877", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56457257000": {"Name": "Campbell C.A.", "AuthorID": "56457257000", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202358601": {"Name": "Byrne M.", "AuthorID": "7202358601", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55243134200": {"Name": "Craig T.", "AuthorID": "55243134200", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23006795600": {"Name": "Valmaggia L.", "AuthorID": "23006795600", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7801668191": {"Name": "Huddy V.", "AuthorID": "7801668191", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
