Diagnosis is based upon clinical presentation, laboratory indices and imaging studies, whilst illness severity can be assessed by clinical scoring systems, such as the Ranson, Glasgow or APACHE II criteria, or by radiological assessments such as the CT severity index. Most patients develop self-limiting disease but a minority progress to a severe form with both local and systemic complications. Management is usually non-operative with interventional therapy reserved for those with common bile duct stones or complications, such as walled-off necrosis or pseudocyst formation. This article will review the pathophysiology, assessment and treatment of acute pancreatitis, the revisions made to the Atlanta Classification system, and the surgical and non-surgical techniques for local complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute pancreatitis", "antibiotics", "endoscopic necrosectomy", "nutrition", "pseudocyst", "severity", "VARD", "WOPN"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923556801", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56515997800": {"Name": "Bell D.", "AuthorID": "56515997800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56516225000": {"Name": "Keane M.", "AuthorID": "56516225000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
