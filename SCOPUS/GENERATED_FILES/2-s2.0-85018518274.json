This study illustrates one direct correlation between total tissue pressure and increased deposition of collagen within the tissue matrix. This observation comes from a new modification to a conventional piezoelectric pressure catheter, used to independently separate and quantify total tissue pressure, solid stress (SS), and interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) within the same tumor location, thereby clarifying the relationship between these parameters. Additionally, total tissue pressure shows a direct correlation with verteporfin uptake, demonstrating the impediment of systemically delivered molecules with increased tissue hypertension.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular proliferations", "Interstitial fluid pressures", "Osmotic swelling", "Pancreas cancer", "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma", "Piezoelectric pressure", "Tissue matrices", "Tumor location", "Animals", "Biological Transport", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Collagen", "Compressive Strength", "Extracellular Fluid", "Female", "Humans", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Porphyrins", "Pressure", "Rats", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018518274", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55368548000": {"Name": "Nieskoski M.", "AuthorID": "55368548000", "AffiliationID": "60030443, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College"}, "57189591854": {"Name": "Marra K.", "AuthorID": "57189591854", "AffiliationID": "60030443, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College"}, "7201609138": {"Name": "Gunn J.", "AuthorID": "7201609138", "AffiliationID": "60030443, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College"}, "8407735000": {"Name": "Kanick S.", "AuthorID": "8407735000", "AffiliationID": "60030443, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College"}, "6701690953": {"Name": "Doyley M.", "AuthorID": "6701690953", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Rochester"}, "6505485360": {"Name": "Stuart Trembly B.", "AuthorID": "6505485360", "AffiliationID": "60030443, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College"}, "7005432217": {"Name": "Pogue B.", "AuthorID": "7005432217", "AffiliationID": "60030443, 60010756", "AffiliationName": "Thayer School of Engineering, Dartmouth College"}, "7101783278": {"Name": "Hasan T.", "AuthorID": "7101783278", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Wellman Center for Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}}}
