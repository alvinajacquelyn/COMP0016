Blend fibers of PDEGMA and poly(L-lactic acid-co-\u03b5-caprolactone) (P(LLA-CL) were fabricated via electrospinning, and analogous fibers containing the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIF) were also prepared. Smooth cylindrical fibers were obtained, albeit with a small amount of beading visible for the ciprofloxacin-loaded fibers. X-ray diffraction showed the drug to exist in the amorphous physical form post-electrospinning. The composite fibers showed distinct thermosensitive properties and gave sustained release of CIF over more than 160 h in vitro. The fibers could promote the proliferation of fibroblasts, and by varying the temperature cells could easily be attached to and detached from the fibers. Antibacterial tests demonstrated that fibers loaded with ciprofloxacin were effective in inhibiting the growth of E. coli and S. aureus. In vivo investigations on rats indicated that the composite PDEGMA/P(LLA-CL) fibers loaded with CIF had much more potent wound healing properties than a commercial gauze and CIF-loaded fibers made solely of P(LLA-CL). These results demonstrate the potential of PDEGMA/P(LLA-CL)/ciprofloxacin fibers as advanced wound dressing materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ciprofloxacin", "Electrospinning", "P(LLA-CL)", "PDEGMA", "Thermosensitive", "Wound dressing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bandages", "Ciprofloxacin", "Drug Carriers", "Drug Liberation", "Escherichia coli", "Fibroblasts", "Male", "Methacrylates", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Nanofibers", "Polyesters", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Skin Irritancy Tests", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Tissue Engineering", "Wound Healing", "Wounds and Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002994501", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56184012500": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "56184012500", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57116662400": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57116662400", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "56946150900": {"Name": "Lv Y.", "AuthorID": "56946150900", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "55495902900": {"Name": "Sun X.", "AuthorID": "55495902900", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "56714038100": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "56714038100", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "55710395600": {"Name": "Zhu L.", "AuthorID": "55710395600", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
