For a large scale mmWave ad hoc network in which eavesdroppers are randomly located, however, eavesdroppers can still intercept the confidential messages, since they may reside in the signal beam. This paper explores the potential of physical layer security in the mmWave ad hoc networks. Specifically, we characterize the impact of mmWave channel characteristics and large antenna arrays on the secrecy performance. We also characterize the impact of artificial noise in this networks. Our results reveal that in the low transmit power regime, the use of low mmWave frequency achieves better secrecy performance, when increasing transmit power, a transition from low mmWave frequency to high mmWave frequency is demanded for obtaining more secrecy rate. Eavesdroppers can intercept more information by using wide beam pattern. Furthermore, the use of artificial noise may be unable to enhance the secrecy rate for the case of low node density.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Artificial noise", "Channel characteristics", "Confidential message", "Directional Antenna", "Millimeter waves (mmwave)", "Mm-wave frequencies", "Physical layer security", "Transmit power"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015434297", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"56021641700": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "56021641700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56072896600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56072896600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55934670700": {"Name": "Heath R.", "AuthorID": "55934670700", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas at Austin"}}}
