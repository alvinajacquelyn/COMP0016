Accordingly, we examined the risk of depressive symptoms in this phenotype using a 16-year follow-up prospective study. Methods A sample of 14 475 participants (75% men), aged 44-59 years in 1996, was drawn from the Gazel cohort. Obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI)\u2265 30 kg/m2 and metabolic health as having none of the self-reported following cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale in 1996, 1999, 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2012. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used to estimate the risk of depressive symptoms during a follow-up of 16 years. Results In multivariate analyses, metabolically unhealthy normal weight [Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.37; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.25-1.51], overweight [1.44 (1.31-1.59)] and obese [1.30 (1.10-1.54)] but not MHO participants [1.04 (0.81-1.32)] had higher risk of depressive symptoms at the start of follow-up compared to metabolically healthy normal weight individuals. Depressive symptoms decreased over time in metabolically healthy normal weight individuals [0.52 (0.50-0.55)], this decrease was less marked only in metabolically unhealthy obese participants [1.22 (1.07-1.40)]. Compared to MHO participants, metabolically unhealthy obese individuals were at increased risk of depression at the start of follow-up, but with a similar reduction of this risk over time. Conclusion Poor metabolic health, irrespective of BMI was associated with greater depressive symptoms at the start of follow-up, whereas a poorer course of depressive symptoms over time was observed only in those with both obesity and poor metabolic health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Body Mass Index", "Cohort Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity, Metabolically Benign"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017098578", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55892777300": {"Name": "Hinnouho G.M.", "AuthorID": "55892777300", "AffiliationID": "60029937", "AffiliationName": "University Versailles St-Quentin en Yvelines"}, "16739737400": {"Name": "Gueguen A.", "AuthorID": "16739737400", "AffiliationID": "60106188, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm, UMS 011"}, "56107046100": {"Name": "Matta J.", "AuthorID": "56107046100", "AffiliationID": "101300074", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, Holy Spirit University"}, "7404395870": {"Name": "Goldberg M.", "AuthorID": "7404395870", "AffiliationID": "60029937", "AffiliationName": "University Versailles St-Quentin en Yvelines"}, "7005528594": {"Name": "Zins M.", "AuthorID": "7005528594", "AffiliationID": "60029937", "AffiliationName": "University Versailles St-Quentin en Yvelines"}, "35229348600": {"Name": "Czernichow S.", "AuthorID": "35229348600", "AffiliationID": "60030857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, European Hospital Georges Pompidou"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55901199000": {"Name": "Lemogne C.", "AuthorID": "55901199000", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm U894, Centre Psychiatrie et Neurosciences"}}}
