Intravenous lipid emulsions and risk of hepatotoxicity in infants and children: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "Year": 2016, "Source": "J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol.

A systematic review of the literature (up to March 2015) identified 23 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 17 were performed in preterm infants or critically ill neonates with a short duration of intervention, 2 in older children with short-term use (following surgery or bone marrow transplantation), 1 in neonates with long-term use, and 3 in infants and children receiving long-term parenteral nutrition (PN). Meta-analysis showed no differences in the rate of cholestasis or bilirubin levels associated with short-term use of different ILEs. Because of high heterogeneity of the long-term studies no meta-analysis could be performed. Available studies found that the use of multicomponent fish oil (FO)-containing ILE compared with pure soya bean oil (SO), ILE-reduced liver enzymes, and bilirubin levels in noncholestatic children on long-term PN and one other RCT found that FO-based ILE-reversed cholestasis in a proportion of patients. The ESPGHAN Committee on Nutrition concludes that there is no evidence of a difference in rates of cholestasis or bilirubin levels between different ILE for short-term use in neonates. The use of multicomponent FO-containing ILE may contribute to a decrease in total bilirubin levels in children with IF on prolonged PN. Well-designed RCTs are, however, lacking and long-term effects have not been determined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "fish oil", "infants", "lipids", "medium-chain triglycerides", "neonates", "olive oil", "soya bean oil"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advisory Committees", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cholestasis", "Europe", "Fat Emulsions, Intravenous", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Liver Function Tests", "Male", "Parenteral Nutrition", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Risk Assessment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955571791", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"7801459343": {"Name": "Hojsak I.", "AuthorID": "7801459343", "AffiliationID": "60006461", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital Zagreb"}, "7006817006": {"Name": "Colomb V.", "AuthorID": "7006817006", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7004464897": {"Name": "Braegger C.", "AuthorID": "7004464897", "AffiliationID": "60002695", "AffiliationName": "University Children's Hospital"}, "6603234228": {"Name": "Bronsky J.", "AuthorID": "6603234228", "AffiliationID": "60023469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Motol"}, "55881021700": {"Name": "Campoy C.", "AuthorID": "55881021700", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Granada"}, "6508129151": {"Name": "Domell\u00f6f M.", "AuthorID": "6508129151", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Umea University"}, "6603170617": {"Name": "Embleton N.", "AuthorID": "6603170617", "AffiliationID": "60001239, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle Neonatal Service, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust and Newcastle University"}, "23027253400": {"Name": "Fidler Mis N.", "AuthorID": "23027253400", "AffiliationID": "60073906, 60021479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana"}, "8564872100": {"Name": "Hulst J.M.", "AuthorID": "8564872100", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital"}, "6507823589": {"Name": "Indrio F.", "AuthorID": "6507823589", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Gastroenterology Division, Ospedale Pediatrico Giovanni XXIII, University of Bari"}, "7005582079": {"Name": "Lapillonne A.", "AuthorID": "7005582079", "AffiliationID": "60002441, 60008135", "AffiliationName": "CNRC, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "6701736868": {"Name": "Mihatsch W.", "AuthorID": "6701736868", "AffiliationID": "100333388", "AffiliationName": "Harlaching Hospital, Department of Pediatrics, Munich Municipal Hospitals"}, "7005027256": {"Name": "Molgaard C.", "AuthorID": "7005027256", "AffiliationID": "60006564, 60015199", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Nutrition Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"}, "7004219656": {"Name": "Van Goudoever J.", "AuthorID": "7004219656", "AffiliationID": "60070178", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Emma Children's Hospital-AMC"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
