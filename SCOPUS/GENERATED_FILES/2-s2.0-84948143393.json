Twenty seven asymptomatic relatives of AC probands (mean age 39.6 \u00b1 19.5 years, 37 % male) with a desmosomal pathogenic mutation but no additional criteria for AC (group II) were compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls (group I). In addition, 70 patients harboring a pathogenic desmosomal mutation with \u201cdefinitive\u201d diagnosis of AC (group IV), and 19 subjects with \u201cborderline\u201d diagnosis (group III) were also studied. A standard echocardiographic evaluation plus left (LV) and right ventricular global and regional transmural, endocardial, and epicardial longitudinal strain (LS) analysis, was performed. In group II, while LV ejection fraction, fractional shortening, and S\u2032 were not significantly reduced compared to controls, transmural global LS was significantly reduced to 19.3 \u00b1 1.8 % in group II versus 20.9 \u00b1 1.1 % in controls (p = 0.0003). Compared to controls, group II presented significant (p < 0.05) regional LS decrease in the basal infero-lateral, antero-lateral, latero-apical, infero-septal, and septo-apical segments. Moreover, LS of the latero-apical and the basal antero-lateral segments was significantly altered in the epicardium (p < 0.05) but not significantly in the endocardium. Global and regional LV LS analysis allows detection of AC in an early or non-diagnostic stage of the disease. Moreover, epicardial LS analysis allows the detection of abnormalities earlier than endocardial LS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy", "Cardiac imaging", "Echocardiography", "Myocardial strain", "Speckle tracking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Cardiomyopathies", "Case-Control Studies", "Early Diagnosis", "Echocardiography, Doppler", "Female", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Contraction", "Pericardium", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Stress, Mechanical", "Stroke Volume", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948143393", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6507624424": {"Name": "R\u00e9ant P.", "AuthorID": "6507624424", "AffiliationID": "60003434", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Cardiologique Haut-L\u00e9v\u00eaque"}, "56976113600": {"Name": "Hauer A.D.", "AuthorID": "56976113600", "AffiliationID": "60070161", "AffiliationName": "Haga Teaching Hospital"}, "55318143300": {"Name": "Castelletti S.", "AuthorID": "55318143300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6508359030": {"Name": "Pantazis A.", "AuthorID": "6508359030", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35620856500": {"Name": "Rosmini S.", "AuthorID": "35620856500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56976091500": {"Name": "Cheang M.H.", "AuthorID": "56976091500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8786523100": {"Name": "Tom\u00e9-Esteban M.", "AuthorID": "8786523100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8892126000": {"Name": "Syrris P.", "AuthorID": "8892126000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56672467900": {"Name": "McKenna W.J.", "AuthorID": "56672467900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Inherited Cardiac Disease Unit and Division of Cardiovascular Imaging, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "23971177600": {"Name": "Peyrou J.", "AuthorID": "23971177600", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "CHU de Bordeaux, CIC1401 (Pessac), University of Bordeaux"}, "7004141972": {"Name": "Lafitte S.", "AuthorID": "7004141972", "AffiliationID": "60102125, 60021564", "AffiliationName": "CHU de Bordeaux, CIC1401 (Pessac), University of Bordeaux"}}}
