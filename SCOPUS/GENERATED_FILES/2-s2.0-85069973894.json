KGaA, WeinheimInvited for this month's cover picture is the group of Dr. Macdonald from the Department of Chemistry at University College London (UK). The cover picture shows a scanning electron microscopy image of lanthanum-treated TiO2 nanofibers rendered to show a three-dimensional representation of the nanostructured solar cell. This work shows that the addition of lithium and lanthanum cations causes minimal substitutional or interstitial doping of TiO2 nanofibers. In a solar cell, photovoltaic characteristics reveal that lanthanum treatment is beneficial, whereas lithium treatment is found to be detrimental to the device performance for both dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells.
