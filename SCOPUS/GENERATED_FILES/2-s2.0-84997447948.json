The strategy is used for the label-free and portable sequencing with nanopores. Nanochannels can also be applied to map genomes with high resolution, as shown by Jeffet et al. in this issue of ACS Nano. Here, we compare the two strategies in terms of biophysical similarities and differences and describe that both are complementary and can improve the DNA analysis for genomic research and diagnostics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["DNA analysis", "DNA strands", "Gene sequencing", "Genome mapping", "Genomic research", "High resolution", "Nano channels", "Single molecule level", "Chromosome Mapping", "DNA", "Nanopores", "Nanotechnology", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997447948", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8389134100": {"Name": "Howorka S.", "AuthorID": "8389134100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7004069440": {"Name": "Siwy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004069440", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Irvine, 210G Rowland Hall"}}}
