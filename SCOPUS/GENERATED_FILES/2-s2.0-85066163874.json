DESIGN: Retrospective dual-cohort study. SETTING: Single multidisciplinary PICU. PATIENTS: Two distinct PICU survivor cohorts: 432 unselected admissions from April 2015 to March 2016, and separately 92 patients with abdominal CT imaging at admission from January 2010 to December 2016.None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Admission body mass index and Functional Status Scale scores at admission, PICU discharge, and hospital discharge were obtained for all patients. Acquired functional impairment was defined as increase greater than or equal to 3 in Functional Status Scale from baseline. Patients were classified as having: \"temporary acquired impairment\" (acquired impairment at PICU discharge recovering by hospital discharge), \"persistent acquired impairment\" (acquired impairment at PICU discharge persisting to hospital discharge), and \"no acquired impairment.\" CT scans were analyzed for skeletal muscle and fat area using National Institute of Health ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify associations between body mass index, muscle and fat indices, and acquired functional impairment. High baseline body mass index was consistently predictive of persistent acquired impairment in both cohorts. In the second cohort, when body mass index was replaced with radiologic anthropometric measurements, greater skeletal muscle, and visceral adipose tissue indices were independently associated with persistent acquired impairment at hospital discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.03-1.61; p = 0.024 and adjusted odds ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28; p = 0.042, respectively). However, this relationship was no longer significant in children with PICU stay greater than 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: In PICU survivors, baseline body mass and composition may play a role in the persistence of acquired functional impairment at hospital discharge. Characterization and quantification of skeletal muscle and fat deserves further study in larger cohorts of PICU children.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Body Composition", "Body Mass Index", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Critical Illness", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Infant", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Intra-Abdominal Fat", "Male", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Recovery of Function", "Retrospective Studies", "Survivors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066163874", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"55991487300": {"Name": "Ong C.", "AuthorID": "55991487300", "AffiliationID": "60015772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, KK Women's and Children's Hospital"}, "57221623399": {"Name": "Lee J.H.", "AuthorID": "57221623399", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Office of Clinical Sciences, Duke-NUS Medical School"}, "55976526200": {"Name": "Wong J.J.M.", "AuthorID": "55976526200", "AffiliationID": "60015772", "AffiliationName": "Children's Intensive Care Unit, Department of Pediatrics, KK Women's and Children's Hospital"}, "57205467218": {"Name": "Senna S.", "AuthorID": "57205467218", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Duke-NUS Medical School"}, "57208933202": {"Name": "Chia A.Z.H.", "AuthorID": "57208933202", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University"}, "55921011700": {"Name": "Leow M.K.S.", "AuthorID": "55921011700", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Program, Duke-NUS Medical School"}, "41561312100": {"Name": "Fortier M.V.", "AuthorID": "41561312100", "AffiliationID": "60113364, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, Agency for Science and Technology (A*STAR)"}, "6508205361": {"Name": "Puthucheary Z.A.", "AuthorID": "6508205361", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Adult Critical Care Unit, Royal London Hospital"}}}
