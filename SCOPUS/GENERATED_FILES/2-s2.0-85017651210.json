The policy was initially driven by Finnish President Mauno Koivisto, who spoke publicly of his belief that the Ingrian Finnish minority in Russia was Finnish because it was Lutheran rather than Orthodox. However, Finnish politicians increasingly abandoned the view of a common Lutheran identity between Ingrian Finns and Finland, and shifted the discussion to language, ancestry and historical memory, which were used to both endorse and disendorse Ingrian Finns\u2019 Finnishness. We argue that the disappearance of religion from the Right to Return discourse was a strategic\u2013if not necessarily conscious\u2013choice that emphasized the more primordial aspects of Finnish identity (and the Ingrian Finns\u2019 lack of those), which in turn enabled stricter restrictions and, ultimately, the discontinuation of the policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["citizenship", "discourse", "ethnicity", "Finland", "Ingrian Finns", "national identity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017651210", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57193956335": {"Name": "Prindiville N.", "AuthorID": "57193956335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London"}, "26221775600": {"Name": "Hjelm T.", "AuthorID": "26221775600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College London"}}}
