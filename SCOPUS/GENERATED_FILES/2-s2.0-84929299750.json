A diverse sample of 32 ICE investigators across all nine Australian jurisdictions individually participated in anonymous in-depth interviews. Participants were asked to discuss their subjective experience of viewing ICE material and its effect on them and to describe a case that evoked an adverse reaction, the nature of the reaction, and the characteristics of the material that contributed to it. The results revealed that ICE investigators experience salient emotional, cognitive, social and behavioural consequences due to viewing ICE material and their reactions can be short and long term. The degree of negative impact appears to vary markedly across individuals, types and content of material and viewing context, with variation based on individual, case-related and contextual factors both in and outside the workplace.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child pornography", "Child sexual abuse images", "ICE investigator reactions", "ICE material", "Internet child exploitation material"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929299750", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"7401872454": {"Name": "Powell M.", "AuthorID": "7401872454", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Deakin University"}, "55995450700": {"Name": "Benson M.", "AuthorID": "55995450700", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Deakin University"}, "55463979200": {"Name": "Cassematis P.", "AuthorID": "55463979200", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Key Centre for Ethics, Law, Justice and Governance, Griffith University"}, "6603037767": {"Name": "Smallbone S.", "AuthorID": "6603037767", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "School of Criminology and Criminal Justice, Griffith University"}, "6603079491": {"Name": "Wortley R.", "AuthorID": "6603079491", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
