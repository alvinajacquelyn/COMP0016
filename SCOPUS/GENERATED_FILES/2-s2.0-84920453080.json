The precise brain temperature providing optimal neuroprotection is unknown.Methods-After a quantified global cerebral hypoxic-ischemic insult, 28 piglets aged <24 hours were randomized (each group, n=7) to (1) normothermia (38.5\u00b0C throughout) or whole-body cooling 2 to 26 hours after insult to (2) 35\u00b0C, (3) 33.5\u00b0C, or (4) 30\u00b0C. At 48 hours after hypoxia-ischemia, delayed cell death (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling and cleaved caspase 3) and microglial ramification (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1) were evaluated.Results-At 48 hours after hypoxia-ischemia, substantial cerebral injury was found in the normothermia and 30\u00b0C hypothermia groups. However, with 35\u00b0C and 33.5\u00b0C cooling, a clear reduction in delayed cell death and microglial activation was observed in most brain regions (P<0.05), with no differences between 35\u00b0C and 33.5\u00b0C cooling groups. A protective pattern was observed, with U-shaped temperature dependence in delayed cell death in periventricular white matter, caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus, and thalamus. A microglial activation pattern was also seen, with inverted U-shaped temperature dependence in periventricular white matter, caudate nucleus, internal capsule, and hippocampus (all P<0.05).Conclusions-Cooling to 35\u00b0C (an absolute drop of 3.5\u00b0C as in therapeutic hypothermia protocols) or to 33.5\u00b0C provided protection in most brain regions after a cerebral hypoxic-ischemic insult in the newborn piglet. Although the relatively wide therapeutic range of a 3.5\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C drop in temperature reassured, overcooling (an 8.5\u00b0C drop) was clearly detrimental in some brain regions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hypothermia", "hypoxia-ischemia, brain", "neonatal encephalopathy", "neuroprotection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Asphyxia", "Brain", "Caudate Nucleus", "Cell Death", "Cell Survival", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hippocampus", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Putamen", "Swine", "Thalamus", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920453080", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"35085901300": {"Name": "Alonso-Alconada D.", "AuthorID": "35085901300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7003578598": {"Name": "Broad K.D.", "AuthorID": "7003578598", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "21533470400": {"Name": "Chandrasekaran M.", "AuthorID": "21533470400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "8899329100": {"Name": "Faulkner S.D.", "AuthorID": "8899329100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55191074400": {"Name": "Kerenyi \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "55191074400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55755688000": {"Name": "Hassell J.", "AuthorID": "55755688000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55110477100": {"Name": "Rocha-Ferreira E.", "AuthorID": "55110477100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "22937760400": {"Name": "Hristova M.", "AuthorID": "22937760400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57210546602": {"Name": "Bennett K.", "AuthorID": "57210546602", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "36196575500": {"Name": "Kelen D.", "AuthorID": "36196575500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Bio-engineering, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005849630": {"Name": "Cady E.", "AuthorID": "7005849630", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Bio-engineering, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35784226800": {"Name": "Fleiss B.", "AuthorID": "35784226800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, King's College London"}, "57203054731": {"Name": "Gressens P.", "AuthorID": "57203054731", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, King's College London"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute for Neurology"}}}
