The EMD is a tool to separate time series into implicit components which oscillate at different time-scales. We apply this decomposition to intraday time series of the following three financial indices: the S&P 500 (USA), the IPC (Mexico) and the VIX (volatility index USA), obtaining time-varying multidimensional cross-correlations at different time-scales. The correlations computed over a rolling window are compared across the three indices, across the components at different time-scales and across different time lags. We uncover a rich heterogeneity of interactions, which depends on the time-scale and has important lead\u2013lag relations that could have practical use for portfolio management, risk estimation and investment decisions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Empirical mode decomposition", "Time-dependent correlation", "Time-scale-dependent correlation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross correlations", "Different time scale", "Dynamic correlation", "Empirical Mode Decomposition", "Investment decisions", "Portfolio managements", "Time-dependent correlation", "Time-scales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043374899", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57045732900": {"Name": "Nava N.", "AuthorID": "57045732900", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}, "57203814738": {"Name": "Di Matteo T.", "AuthorID": "57203814738", "AffiliationID": "60159349", "AffiliationName": "Complexity Science Hub"}, "7003460450": {"Name": "Aste T.", "AuthorID": "7003460450", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}}}
