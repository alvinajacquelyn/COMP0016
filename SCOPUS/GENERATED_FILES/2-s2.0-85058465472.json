However, little is known about its psychometric properties. The aim of this study was to examine the distributions and discriminant and criterion validity of the PDI-RF scale in relation to a number of demographic and socioeconomic factors. Mothers of infants and toddlers (N = 323) from low, medium, and high-risk samples were interviewed with the PDI and transcripts were coded for RF. Demographic and socio-economic data were recorded. The PDI-RF scale showed high inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, and criterion validity. Modest associations with some sociodemographic variables and PDI-RF were found, but together these only accounted for a small amount of variance in the measure, suggesting adequate discriminant validity. Overall, the scale had good psychometric properties, although some caveats for its use were identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Parent Development Interview", "parental mentalizing", "PDI", "psychometric properties", "reflective functioning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058465472", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"12761729700": {"Name": "Sleed M.", "AuthorID": "12761729700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7005885038": {"Name": "Slade A.", "AuthorID": "7005885038", "AffiliationID": "60015278", "AffiliationName": "Yale Child Study Center"}}}
