Scanning electron micrographs provided the morphology of these particles with observed sizes ranging from 10 to 50 nm, whilst FTIR spectra confirmed the absence of polar bonds and organic impurities, and strong Raman active vibrational bands at ca. 1604 and 1311 cm\u20131ascribed to C-C vibrational motions were observed. Carbon signals that resonated at \u03b4C126 ppm in the solid state NMR spectra confirmed that sp2hybridised carbons were present in high concentration in two of the nanoparticle types (AMNP1 and AMNP2). X-ray powder diffraction suggested that AMNP0 contains single phase Tungsten carbide (WC) in a high state of purity and multiple phases of WC/WC1-xwere identified in both AMNP1 and AMNP2. Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectral (XPS) analyses revealed and quantified the elemental ratios in these composite formulations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibacterial", "Antimicrobial", "Antiviral", "Carbide", "Nanoparticles", "Raman", "SS-NMR", "Tungsten", "XPS", "XRD"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021350769", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56954553500": {"Name": "Cheong Y.K.", "AuthorID": "56954553500", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Technology, University of Hertfordshire"}, "23020031700": {"Name": "Ren G.", "AuthorID": "23020031700", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Technology, University of Hertfordshire"}, "56347003000": {"Name": "Calvo-Castro J.", "AuthorID": "56347003000", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "18435943500": {"Name": "Ciric L.", "AuthorID": "18435943500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatics Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55336456200": {"Name": "Illangakoon U.E.", "AuthorID": "55336456200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "22935212900": {"Name": "Mahalingam S.", "AuthorID": "22935212900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194638490": {"Name": "Matharu R.K.", "AuthorID": "57194638490", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "40661103700": {"Name": "Cloutman-Green E.", "AuthorID": "40661103700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Virology, and Infection Prevention Control, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56819779300": {"Name": "Kang Q.", "AuthorID": "56819779300", "AffiliationID": "60020745, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Metal Research, Chinese Academy of Science"}, "7501530430": {"Name": "Wilson R.M.", "AuthorID": "7501530430", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
