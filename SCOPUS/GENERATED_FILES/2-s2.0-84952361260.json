All rights reserved.The alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist Dexmedetomidine (Dex) is a sedative medication used by anesthesiologists. Dex protects the heart against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) and can also act as a preconditioning mimetic. The mechanisms involved in Dex-dependent cardiac preconditioning, and whether this action occurs directly or indirectly on cardiomyocytes, still remain unclear. The endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway and endothelial cells are known to play key roles in cardioprotection against IR injury. Therefore, the aims of this work were to evaluate whether the eNOS/NO pathway mediates the pharmacological cardiac effect of Dex, and whether endothelial cells are required in this cardioprotective action. Isolated adult rat hearts were treated with Dex (10 nM) for 25 min and the dimerization of eNOS and production of NO were measured. Hearts were then subjected to global IR (30/120 min) and the role of the eNOS/NO pathway was evaluated. Dex promoted the activation of eNOS and production of NO. Dex reduced the infarct size and improved the left ventricle function recovery, but this effect was reversed when Dex was co-administered with inhibitors of the eNOS/NO/PKG pathway. In addition, Dex was unable to reduce cell death in isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes subjected to simulated IR. Cardiomyocyte death was attenuated by co-culturing them with endothelial cells pre-treated with Dex. In summary, our results show that Dex triggers cardiac protection by activating the eNOS/NO signaling pathway. This pharmacological effect of Dex requires its interaction with the endothelium.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dexmedetomidine", "Endothelium", "Hearte", "Ischemia-reperfusion", "NOS", "Preconditioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists", "Animals", "Cardiotonic Agents", "Cells, Cultured", "Coculture Techniques", "Dexmedetomidine", "Endothelial Cells", "Heart", "Humans", "Male", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Myocardium", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Nitric Oxide", "Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952361260", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"56015203500": {"Name": "Riquelme J.", "AuthorID": "56015203500", "AffiliationID": "60012464, 60002946", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Center for Chronic Disease (ACCDiS), Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas and Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile"}, "35390203600": {"Name": "Westermeier F.", "AuthorID": "35390203600", "AffiliationID": "60012464, 60002946", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Center for Chronic Disease (ACCDiS), Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas and Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile"}, "9042283100": {"Name": "Pedrozo Z.", "AuthorID": "9042283100", "AffiliationID": "60012464", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Ciencias Biom\u00e9dicas (ICBM), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile"}, "7003675930": {"Name": "Lavandero S.", "AuthorID": "7003675930", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine (Cardiology Division), University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"}, "57213019287": {"Name": "Hall A.", "AuthorID": "57213019287", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "16647995600": {"Name": "Vicencio J.", "AuthorID": "16647995600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "57197213526": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez G.", "AuthorID": "57197213526", "AffiliationID": "60012464", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Ciencias Biom\u00e9dicas (ICBM), Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Chile"}, "6507104626": {"Name": "Ibacache M.", "AuthorID": "6507104626", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Divisi\u00f3n de Anestesiolog\u00eda.
