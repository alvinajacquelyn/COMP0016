Materials and methods: Patients with primary penile cancer \u2265T1G2 were included in the study. A total of 113 groins with impalpable inguinal lymph nodes (cN0) underwent planar lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT-CT. The sentinel lymph nodes were mapped on cross sectional imaging according to Daseler's anatomical description. Using measurements from fixed anatomical landmarks, a custom-made software program mapped the SLNs. SLNs were mapped to the previously undefined Zone V using 3 approaches to avoid observational bias: (a) as perceived by the uroradiologist, (b) limiting Zone V to a 5 mm radius from the sapheno-femoral junction or (c) using a 10 mm radius from the sapheno-femoral junction. Results: Using SPECT-CT, drainage to the groins was seen in 109 of the 113 cN0 groins (96.5%). The majority of the SLNs were located in the central and superior quadrants with 38.2% lying within Zone I, 45% in Zone II and 13% in Zone V. More importantly, sentinel lymph nodes were still localised to the inferior zones with 3% located in Zone III and 0.8% in Zone IV. Conclusions: Using a hybrid of SPECT-CT, cross sectional imaging and lymphoscintigraphy we have demonstrated that SLNs may be located in the inferior zones. We also define the limits of Zone V as an area of 5 mm radius from the sapheno-femoral junction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lymphadenectomy", "Penile cancer", "Penile neoplasm", "Sentinel lymph node", "Single photon emission computed tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Lymphoscintigraphy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Penile Neoplasms", "Prognosis", "Sentinel Lymph Node", "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy", "Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054597831", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57189423601": {"Name": "Omorphos S.", "AuthorID": "57189423601", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "26667018400": {"Name": "Nigam R.", "AuthorID": "26667018400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7102425101": {"Name": "Malone P.", "AuthorID": "7102425101", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "54399175900": {"Name": "Saad Z.", "AuthorID": "54399175900", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospital"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospital"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London Hospital"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
