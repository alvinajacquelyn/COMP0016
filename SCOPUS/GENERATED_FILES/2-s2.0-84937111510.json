Distamycin analogues containing N-terminal biaryl-motifs 2(1-5)(1-7) were synthesised using a solution-phase approach and evaluated for their anti-mycobacterial activity and DNA-sequence selectivity. Thiophene dimer motif-containing polyamide 2(2,6) exhibited 10-fold higher inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis compared to distamycin and library member 2(5,7) showed high binding affinity for the 5\u2032-ACATAT-3\u2032 sequence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-tubercular agents", "Antibiotic resistance", "Combinatorial chemistry", "Distamycin", "DNA-minor groove ligands", "Whole cell phenotypic evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antitubercular Agents", "Binding Sites", "Combinatorial Chemistry Techniques", "Distamycins", "DNA Footprinting", "DNA, Bacterial", "Ligands", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Models, Molecular", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Nylons", "Small Molecule Libraries", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Thiophenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937111510", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"36522305200": {"Name": "Brucoli F.", "AuthorID": "36522305200", "AffiliationID": "60097343", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Sport, Institute of Biomedical and Environmental Health Research (IBEHR), University of the West of Scotland"}, "37031058500": {"Name": "Guzman J.D.", "AuthorID": "37031058500", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacteria Research Laboratory, Department of Biological Sciences, University of London"}, "55831167600": {"Name": "Maitra A.", "AuthorID": "55831167600", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacteria Research Laboratory, Department of Biological Sciences, University of London"}, "6701498589": {"Name": "Bhakta S.", "AuthorID": "6701498589", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Mycobacteria Research Laboratory, Department of Biological Sciences, University of London"}, "7203017691": {"Name": "James C.H.", "AuthorID": "7203017691", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, London"}, "35583879100": {"Name": "Fox K.R.", "AuthorID": "35583879100", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
