Methods: Fifty patients (mean age: 74.5 years; 32 men) with severe refractory tremor (36 essential, 14 parkinsonian) were treated with unilateral GKT. Targeting of the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) was achieved with Leksell Gamma Knife with a single shot through a 4-mm collimator helmet. The prescription dose was 130 Gy. Neurologic and neuropsychological assessments including a single-blinded video assessment of the tremor severity performed by a movement disorders neurologist from another center were performed before and 12 months after treatment. MRI follow-up occurred at 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: The upper limb tremor score improved by 54.2% on the blinded assessment (p < 0.0001). All tremor components (rest, postural, and intention) were improved. Activities of daily living were improved by 72.2%. Cognitive functions remained unchanged. Following GKT, the median delay of improvement was 5.3 months (range 1-12 months). The only side effect was a transient hemiparesis associated with excessive edema around the thalamotomy in one patient. Conclusion: This blinded prospective assessment demonstrates that unilateral GKT is a safe and efficient procedure for severe medically refractory tremor. Side effects were rare and transient in this study. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that for patients with severe refractory tremor, GKT is well tolerated and effective in reducing tremor impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cohort Studies", "Essential Tremor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Prospective Studies", "Radiosurgery", "Severity of Illness Index", "Single-Blind Method", "Thalamus", "Treatment Outcome", "Tremor", "Ventral Thalamic Nuclei"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946234761", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55964020200": {"Name": "Witjas T.", "AuthorID": "55964020200", "AffiliationID": "60107134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone, UMR 7289, CNRS Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9"}, "23099974400": {"Name": "Eusebio A.", "AuthorID": "23099974400", "AffiliationID": "60107134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone, UMR 7289, CNRS Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9"}, "7005776874": {"Name": "Azulay J.", "AuthorID": "7005776874", "AffiliationID": "60107134, 60102127", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Neurosciences de la Timone, UMR 7289, CNRS Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9"}, "26040485900": {"Name": "Carron R.", "AuthorID": "26040485900", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, UMR 1106, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9"}, "55502043600": {"Name": "R\u00e9gis J.", "AuthorID": "55502043600", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, UMR 1106, Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9"}, "26643584500": {"Name": "Krack P.", "AuthorID": "26643584500", "AffiliationID": "60104653, 60005851, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, GIN INSERM U318 and CHU de Grenoble, Movement Disorder Unit"}, "6506523174": {"Name": "Vaugoyeau M.", "AuthorID": "6506523174", "AffiliationID": "60102127", "AffiliationName": "CNRS-Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9, Laboratory of Cognitive Neurosciences"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University"}}}
