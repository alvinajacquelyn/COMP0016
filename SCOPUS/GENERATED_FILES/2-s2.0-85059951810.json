AAC was previously successfully applied to multi-objective local search (MOLS) algorithms using offline tools. However, offline approaches are usually very expensive, draw general recommendations regarding algorithm design for a given set of instances, and does generally not allow per-instance adaptation. Online techniques for automatic algorithm control are usually applied to single-objective evolutionary algorithms. In this work we investigate the impact of including control mechanisms to MOLS algorithms on a classical bi-objective permutation flowshop scheduling problem (PFSP), and demonstrate how even simple control mechanisms can complement traditional offline configuration techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithm design", "Automatic algorithms", "Control mechanism", "Local search algorithm", "Off-line approaches", "Online technique", "Permutation flowshop scheduling problems", "Single objective"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059951810", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55974628000": {"Name": "Blot A.", "AuthorID": "55974628000", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60008134, 60122064", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille, CNRS, UMR 9189 - CRIStAL"}, "57195234359": {"Name": "Kessaci M.\u00c9.", "AuthorID": "57195234359", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60008134, 60122064", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille, CNRS, UMR 9189 - CRIStAL"}, "6603180053": {"Name": "Jourdan L.", "AuthorID": "6603180053", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60008134, 60122064", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille, CNRS, UMR 9189 - CRIStAL"}, "54891852800": {"Name": "De Causmaecker P.", "AuthorID": "54891852800", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven, CODeS and imec research groups"}}}
