Generally these organs possess an outer matrix consisting of collagen, elastin, and cells such as smooth muscle cells (SMC) and a luminal layer consisting of endothelial or epithelial cells, whilst presenting a barrier to luminal content. Tissue engineering research enables the construction of such organs and this study explores this possibility with a bioabsorbable nanocomposite biomaterial, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) urea urethane (POSS\u2013PCL).Our established methods of tubular graft extrusion were modified using a porogen-incorporated POSS\u2013PCL and a new lamination method was explored. Porogen (40, 60 or 105 \u00b5m) were introduced to POSS\u2013PCL, which were fabricated into a bilayered, dual topography matching the exterior and luminal interior of tubular organs. POSS\u2013PCL with different amounts of porogen were tested for their suitability as a SMC layer by measuring optimal interactions with human adipose derived stem cells. Angiogenesis potential was tested with the chorioallantoic membrane assay. Tensile strength and burst pressures of bilayared tubular grafts were determined. Scaffolds made with 40 \u00b5m porogen demonstrated optimal adipose derived stem cell integration and the scaffolds were able to accommodate angiogenesis. Mechanical properties of the grafts confirmed their potential to match the relevant physiological and biophysical parameters. This study presents a platform for the development of hollow organs for transplantation based on POSS\u2013PCL. These bilayered-tubular structures can be tailor-made for cellular integration and match physico-mechanical properties of physiological systems of interest. More specific luminal cell integration and sources of SMC for the external layer could be further explored.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose derived stem cells", "Biophysical parameters", "Chorioallantoic membrane assays", "Human adipose derived stem cells", "Physicomechanical properties", "Physiological systems", "Poly (epsiloncaprolactone)", "Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes", "Cells, Cultured", "Child", "Humans", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924205644", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"25635358300": {"Name": "de Mel A.", "AuthorID": "25635358300", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, Royal Free NHS Trust Hospital Campus"}, "56538075300": {"Name": "Yap T.", "AuthorID": "56538075300", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, Royal Free NHS Trust Hospital Campus"}, "55637955400": {"Name": "Cittadella G.", "AuthorID": "55637955400", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, Royal Free NHS Trust Hospital Campus"}, "56537960100": {"Name": "Hale L.R.", "AuthorID": "56537960100", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, Royal Free NHS Trust Hospital Campus"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "54941130700": {"Name": "Maghsoudlou P.", "AuthorID": "54941130700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "24801882300": {"Name": "de Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "24801882300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60029890, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital, University College London"}}}
