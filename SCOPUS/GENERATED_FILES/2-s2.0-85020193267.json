In anticipation of this demand, eBIC was set up at Diamond Light Source in collaboration with Birkbeck College London and the University of Oxford, and funded by the Wellcome Trust, the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) to provide access to high-end equipment through peer review. eBIC is currently in its start-up phase and began by offering time on a single FEI Titan Krios microscope equipped with the latest generation of direct electron detectors from two manufacturers. Here, the current status and modes of access for potential users of eBIC are outlined. In the first year of operation, 222\u00e2\u20acd of microscope time were delivered to external research groups, with 95 visits in total, of which 53 were from unique groups. The data collected have generated multiple high- to intermediate-resolution structures (2.8-8 \u00c5), ten of which have been published. A second Krios microscope is now in operation, with two more due to come online in 2017. In the next phase of growth of eBIC, in addition to more microscope time, new data-collection strategies and sample-preparation techniques will be made available to external user groups. Finally, all raw data are archived, and a metadata catalogue and automated pipelines for data analysis are being developed.This paper provides an introduction to the Electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC) at Diamond Light Source: an external user facility established in the UK for high-end cryo-electron microscopy. Details are given of the first year of operation along with highlights and future challenges.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cryo-EM", "cryo-ET", "eBIC", "Electron Bio-Imaging Centre", "user facilities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Electron Microscope Tomography", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Research", "Specimen Handling", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020193267", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"]], "AuthorData": {"7003967686": {"Name": "Clare D.", "AuthorID": "7003967686", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "11439518300": {"Name": "Siebert C.", "AuthorID": "11439518300", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55441526300": {"Name": "Hecksel C.", "AuthorID": "55441526300", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "9739405700": {"Name": "Ashton A.", "AuthorID": "9739405700", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57203294670": {"Name": "Walsh M.", "AuthorID": "57203294670", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7007067426": {"Name": "Gr\u00fcnewald K.", "AuthorID": "7007067426", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "35492295700": {"Name": "Saibil H.", "AuthorID": "35492295700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Crystallography Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "56377639700": {"Name": "Stuart D.", "AuthorID": "56377639700", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "56175634000": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "56175634000", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "7102218918": {"Name": "Hagen C.", "AuthorID": "7102218918", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "57194459509": {"Name": "Mordhorst V.", "AuthorID": "57194459509", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "56906065200": {"Name": "Grange M.", "AuthorID": "56906065200", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}}}
