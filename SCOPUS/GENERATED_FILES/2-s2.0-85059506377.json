Ag(Nb 0.8 Ta 0.2 )O 3 is used here as a model system to shed light on the nature of the low temperature phase behavior of the unsubstituted parent compound AgNbO 3 , which is an important material for high-power energy storage applications. The three dielectric anomalies previously identified as M 1 \u2194 M 2 , T f and M 2 \u2194 M 3 transitions in AgNbO 3 ceramics are found to be intimately related to the polarization the behavior of the B-site cations. In particular, the M 1 \u2194 M 2 transition is found to involve the disappearance of original ferroelectric polar structure in the M 1 phase. Analysis of weak-field and strong field hysteresis loops in the M 2 region below T f suggests the presence of a weakly-polar structure exhibiting antipolar behavior (i.e., a non-compensated antiferroelectric), which can be considered as ferrielectric (FIE). Modeling of the permittivity data using the Curie-Weiss law indicates that the Curie temperature is close to the freezing temperature, T f , which can be regarded as the Curie point of the FIE phase. Substitution by Ta 5+ in this system enhances the stability of the weakly polar/antiferroelectric state, giving rise to an increased energy storage density of 3.7 J cm -3 under an applied field of 27 MV m -1 , one of the highest values ever reported for a dielectric ceramic. Furthermore, the energy storage capability remains approximately constant at around 3 J cm -3 up to 100 \u00b0C, at an applied field of 22 MV m -1 .", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti ferroelectrics", "Dielectric anomaly", "Dielectric ceramic", "Energy storage density", "Freezing temperatures", "Low temperature phase", "Polar structures", "Storage capability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059506377", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57183370500": {"Name": "Tian Y.", "AuthorID": "57183370500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55566515300": {"Name": "Jin L.", "AuthorID": "55566515300", "AffiliationID": "60018308, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Materials Research Laboratory, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education, International Center for Dielectric Research, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University"}, "55566410700": {"Name": "Hu Q.", "AuthorID": "55566410700", "AffiliationID": "60018308, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Materials Research Laboratory, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education, International Center for Dielectric Research, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University"}, "57149446500": {"Name": "Yu K.", "AuthorID": "57149446500", "AffiliationID": "60018308, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Materials Research Laboratory, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education, International Center for Dielectric Research, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University"}, "35072139800": {"Name": "Zhuang Y.", "AuthorID": "35072139800", "AffiliationID": "60018308, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Materials Research Laboratory, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education, International Center for Dielectric Research, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University"}, "8077831000": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "8077831000", "AffiliationID": "60018308, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Materials Research Laboratory, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education, International Center for Dielectric Research, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University"}, "7402117754": {"Name": "Wei X.", "AuthorID": "7402117754", "AffiliationID": "60018308, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Materials Research Laboratory, Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education, International Center for Dielectric Research, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University"}, "7403395240": {"Name": "Yan H.", "AuthorID": "7403395240", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "17347220500": {"Name": "Viola G.", "AuthorID": "17347220500", "AffiliationID": "122210499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Institute of Materials Physics and Engineering"}, "7005656987": {"Name": "Abrahams I.", "AuthorID": "7005656987", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
