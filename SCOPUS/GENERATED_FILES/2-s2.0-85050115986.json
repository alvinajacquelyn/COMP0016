To study whether NFL is associated with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) measurements of white matter (WM) microstructure, Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project participants with normal cognition (n = 77), early mild cognitive impairment (n = 15), and MCI (n = 55) underwent lumbar puncture to obtain CSF and 3T brain MRI. Voxel-wise analyses cross-sectionally related NFL to DTI metrics, adjusting for demographic and vascular risk factors. Increased NFL correlated with multiple DTI metrics (p-values < 0.05). An NFL \u00d7 diagnosis interaction (excluding early mild cognitive impairment) on WM microstructure (p-values < 0.05) was detected, with associations strongest among MCI. Multiple NFL \u00d7 CSF biomarker interactions were detected. Associations between NFL and worse WM metrics were strongest among amyloid-\u03b242\u2013negative, tau-positive, and suspected nonamyloid pathology participants. Findings suggest increased NFL, a biomarker of axonal injury, is correlated with compromised WM microstructure. Results highlight the role of elevated NFL in predicting WM damage in cognitively impaired older adults who are amyloid-negative, tau-positive, or meet suspected nonamyloid pathology criteria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Diffusion tensor imaging", "Neurofilament light"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cohort Studies", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Peptide Fragments", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050115986", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57201549542": {"Name": "Moore E.E.", "AuthorID": "57201549542", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57211697123": {"Name": "Hohman T.J.", "AuthorID": "57211697123", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57202988140": {"Name": "Badami F.S.", "AuthorID": "57202988140", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57202306584": {"Name": "Pechman K.R.", "AuthorID": "57202306584", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "56785622300": {"Name": "Osborn K.E.", "AuthorID": "56785622300", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55641546300": {"Name": "Acosta L.M.Y.", "AuthorID": "55641546300", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "55963292300": {"Name": "Bell S.P.", "AuthorID": "55963292300", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "57201747708": {"Name": "Babicz M.A.", "AuthorID": "57201747708", "AffiliationID": "60005837", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Houston"}, "55956988700": {"Name": "Gifford K.A.", "AuthorID": "55956988700", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "8228195700": {"Name": "Jefferson A.L.", "AuthorID": "8228195700", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "7403369918": {"Name": "Anderson A.W.", "AuthorID": "7403369918", "AffiliationID": "60003915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Vanderbilt University"}, "7402499528": {"Name": "Goldstein L.E.", "AuthorID": "7402499528", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry, Neurology, Radiology, Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Biomedical Engineering, Electrical & Computer Engineering, Boston University School of Medicine and College of Engineering"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Lab, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}}}
