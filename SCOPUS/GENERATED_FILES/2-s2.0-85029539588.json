Two vaccines are currently in development to protect women from Plasmodium falciparum in pregnancy. Both vaccine constructs target the ID1-DBL2X domain of VAR2CSA, a protein expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes (IEs) that mediates parasite sequestration in the placenta. Although development of an effective vaccine may be hampered by ID1-DBL2X polymorphisms expressed by field isolates, a recent study showed that genetic variation of this domain in South American parasite populations is much lower than in other geographical locations. This suggests that a recombinant vaccine designed to be efficacious in Africa and Asia is likely to be efficacious in South America. However, these studies did not include Colombian parasite populations in their analyses, which are known to be genetically distinct from other South American parasite populations due to their independent introduction from Africa. Therefore, we sought to determine the genetic variation of the ID1-DBL2X domain in Colombian parasites to assess the potential efficacy of the vaccine against PAM in this region. Through sequence analysis and population genetics, we show that there is a low degree of genetic variation amongst Colombian parasite populations and that a vaccine containing conserved antigen variants for worldwide populations is likely to be protective against PAM in Colombia. Our analysis also points towards an African origin for Colombian parasite populations, and suggests that their introduction into Colombia was a recurrent process encompassing multiple introduction events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetic diversity", "Malaria origin", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Pregnancy-associated malaria", "Vaccine", "VAR2CSA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Antibodies, Protozoan", "Child", "Colombia", "Female", "Genetic Variation", "Genetics, Population", "Genotype", "Humans", "Malaria Vaccines", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Middle Aged", "Neutralization Tests", "Phylogeny", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Parasitic", "Protozoan Proteins", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029539588", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57192400999": {"Name": "Rajwani J.", "AuthorID": "57192400999", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary"}, "57203269013": {"Name": "Yanow S.K.", "AuthorID": "57203269013", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Alberta"}, "55811947700": {"Name": "Klinger C.M.", "AuthorID": "55811947700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta"}, "56490454700": {"Name": "Dacks J.B.", "AuthorID": "56490454700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University of Alberta"}, "6507506298": {"Name": "Arango E.", "AuthorID": "6507506298", "AffiliationID": "60055833", "AffiliationName": "Grupo Salud y Comunidad, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Antioquia"}, "56157560900": {"Name": "Arroyo M.I.", "AuthorID": "56157560900", "AffiliationID": "60055833", "AffiliationName": "Grupo Salud y Comunidad, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Antioquia"}, "7004228386": {"Name": "Maestre A.", "AuthorID": "7004228386", "AffiliationID": "60055833", "AffiliationName": "Grupo Salud y Comunidad, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de Antioquia"}, "8060590700": {"Name": "Sabbagh A.", "AuthorID": "8060590700", "AffiliationID": "60028993", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche Pour le D\u00e9veloppement (IRD), UMR216 M\u00e8re et enfant face aux infections tropicales"}, "6506829010": {"Name": "Gnidehou S.", "AuthorID": "6506829010", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Campus Saint-Jean, University of Alberta"}}}
