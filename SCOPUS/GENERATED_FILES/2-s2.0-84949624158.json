A test was devised to quantify connection characteristics in fully cracked concrete (applicable to hog zones of the beams). Relative to the FT-based connections, the PT-based connections were of greater strength, nonlinearity and flexibility in compression concrete, and weaker, less stiff but more ductile in tension concrete. One composite beam exhibited 22% redistribution of support reaction at 88% of the failure load. Failure occurred primarily at the connections, which then gradually led to fracture of the LVL as a secondary mode of failure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beech", "Indeterminacy", "Laminated veneer lumber", "Tests", "Timber concrete composite"], "IndexKeywords": ["Beech", "Composite connections", "Concrete composite beams", "Cracked concretes", "Indeterminacy", "Indeterminate beams", "Laminated veneer lumber", "Timber-concrete composites"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949624158", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56249894900": {"Name": "Sebastian W.M.", "AuthorID": "56249894900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Bristol, University Walk"}, "56968217100": {"Name": "Mudie J.", "AuthorID": "56968217100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Bristol, University Walk"}, "56967601400": {"Name": "Cox G.", "AuthorID": "56967601400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Bristol, University Walk"}, "7102853282": {"Name": "Piazza M.", "AuthorID": "7102853282", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, University of Trento"}, "55734347555": {"Name": "Tomasi R.", "AuthorID": "55734347555", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, University of Trento"}, "57215669354": {"Name": "Giongo I.", "AuthorID": "57215669354", "AffiliationID": "60015986", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Mechanical Engineering, University of Trento"}}}
