Since there are multiple pathophysiologies in such patients, tailoring treatment remains essential. Therefore, one simple, reliable tool would be beneficial to assess disease severity and tailor therapy, particularly for internal medicine specialists who may treat a variety of NTDT patients with a multitude of complications. This would allow for standardization of assessments leading to timely interventions and prevention of complications. Methods A working group of NTDT experts was formed to develop a new disease severity scoring system for adult and pediatric patients with NTDT, based on parameters considered to be most pertinent in defining disease severity. Results 20 parameters were selected for inclusion in the disease severity scoring system. An additional six parameters, largely related to growth and development, were selected specifically for pediatric patients (\u2264 16 years of age). Consensus of expert opinion was used to establish the selected methods of assessment for each parameter, based on feasibility and availability of technology, cost containment, and avoidance of patient risk. Conclusion We propose that this new disease severity scoring system for adult and pediatric NTDT patients could be developed into a practical tool for widespread clinical use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disease severity", "Non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia", "Scoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Alanine Transaminase", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "beta-Thalassemia", "Bilirubin", "Bone Diseases, Metabolic", "Child", "Cholecystectomy", "Cholecystitis", "Cholelithiasis", "Comorbidity", "Heart Failure", "Hemoglobins", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis C", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Iron", "Leg Ulcer", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Osteoporosis", "Platelet Count", "Severity of Illness Index", "Splenomegaly", "Stroke Volume", "Thrombosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953282116", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"]], "AuthorData": {"35433934600": {"Name": "Cappellini M.D.", "AuthorID": "35433934600", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60007067", "AffiliationName": "Universita di Milano, Ca Granda Foundation IRCCS"}, "24335608600": {"Name": "Musallam K.M.", "AuthorID": "24335608600", "AffiliationID": "60068761", "AffiliationName": "American University of Beirut"}, "7403427269": {"Name": "Porter J.B.", "AuthorID": "7403427269", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55598806700": {"Name": "Taher A.T.", "AuthorID": "55598806700", "AffiliationID": "60068761", "AffiliationName": "American University of Beirut"}, "6701800299": {"Name": "Kattamis A.", "AuthorID": "6701800299", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens"}, "7003851192": {"Name": "Viprakasit V.", "AuthorID": "7003851192", "AffiliationID": "60011189, 60012718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Thalassemia Center, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University"}, "7004292185": {"Name": "Galanello R.", "AuthorID": "7004292185", "AffiliationID": "60032259, 60108911", "AffiliationName": "Ospedale Regionale Microcitemie, Dipartimento Scienze Biomediche e Biotechnologie, Universit\u00e0 di Cagliari"}}}
