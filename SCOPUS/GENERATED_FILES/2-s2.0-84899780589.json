We show for the first time that a small subset of cells purified from human anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive and-negative, anaplastic large cell lymphoma cell lines and primary patient tumours using the side population (SP) technique have serial tumour-propagating capacity both in vitro and in vivo; they give rise to both themselves and the bulk tumour population as well as supporting growth of the latter through the production of soluble factors. In vivo serial dilution assays utilising a variety of model systems inclusive of human cell lines, primary human tumours and nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK-induced murine tumours demonstrate the TPC frequency to vary from as many as 1/54 to 1/1336 tumour cells. In addition, the SP cells express higher levels of pluripotency-associated transcription factors and are enriched for a gene expression profile consistent with early thymic progenitors. Finally, our data show that the SP cells express higher levels of the NPM-ALK oncogene and are sensitive to an ALK inhibitor.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged, 80 and over", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic", "Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Etoposide", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Middle Aged", "Neoplastic Stem Cells", "Nuclear Proteins", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit", "Pyrazoles", "Pyridines", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Side-Population Cells", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84899780589", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56148867700": {"Name": "Moti N.", "AuthorID": "56148867700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "56736437400": {"Name": "Malcolm T.", "AuthorID": "56736437400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "7003699541": {"Name": "Hamoudi R.", "AuthorID": "7003699541", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Tissue and Energy, Division of Surgery and International Science, University College London"}, "7003763947": {"Name": "Mian S.", "AuthorID": "7003763947", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Histopathology, Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "8565268600": {"Name": "Turner S.D.", "AuthorID": "8565268600", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "56148025100": {"Name": "Garland G.", "AuthorID": "56148025100", "AffiliationID": "60104671", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Diagnostics and Personalised Therapeutics Unit, College of Applied Medical Sciences, University of ha'Il"}, "24337940700": {"Name": "Hook C.E.", "AuthorID": "24337940700", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology and Cytology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "8070254200": {"Name": "Burke G.A.A.", "AuthorID": "8070254200", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7006268119": {"Name": "Wasik M.A.", "AuthorID": "7006268119", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}, "7801579995": {"Name": "Merkel O.", "AuthorID": "7801579995", "AffiliationID": "115350411", "AffiliationName": "European Research Initiative on ALK Related Malignancies (ERIA)"}, "6701851432": {"Name": "Kenner L.", "AuthorID": "6701851432", "AffiliationID": "60023085", "AffiliationName": "Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research (LBI-CR)"}, "21834504600": {"Name": "Laurenti E.", "AuthorID": "21834504600", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto"}, "26643471500": {"Name": "Dick J.E.", "AuthorID": "26643471500", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto"}}}
