Published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Nordic Orthopedic Federation.Background and purpose \u2014 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used in the elderly and are associated with adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to ascertain the prevalence of SSRI use in fragile and surgery-treated hip fracture patients. Methods \u2014 This population-based prevalence study included Danish hip fracture patients aged \u2265 65 years operated in 2006\u20132016 (n = 68,607) and matched individuals from the background population (n = 343,020). Using Poisson regression, prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to compare hip fracture patients with the general population, and to estimate the association between hip fracture patient characteristics and SSRI prescriptions. Results \u2014 The prevalence of SSRI use among hip fracture patients was 23% compared with 12% in the general population. During 2006\u20132016, the prevalence decreased from 26% to 18% among hip fracture patients and from 13% to 10% in the general population. Factors associated with SSRI use in hip fracture patients were age 75\u201384 years (PRR 1.18, CI 1.13\u20131.23), age \u2265 85 years (PRR 1.17, CI 1.11\u20131.22), female sex (PRR 1.13, CI 1.09\u20131.17), unmarried status (PRR 1.15, CI 1.11\u20131.19), living in a residential institution (PRR 2.30, CI 2.19\u20132.40), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score 1\u20132 (PRR 1.50, CI 1.45\u20131.55), CCI score 3+ (PRR 1.62, CI 1.55\u20131.69), and several medications. Interpretation \u2014 The prevalence of SSRI use was high among hip fracture patients compared with the general population. Our data stress the importance of continued clinical awareness of frailty, comorbidity, and polypharmacy of hip fracture patients and the potentially adverse drug effects of SSRI treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Comorbidity", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Denmark", "Depression", "Female", "Fracture Fixation", "Frail Elderly", "Hip Fractures", "Humans", "Male", "Odds Ratio", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058194384", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57204897098": {"Name": "Bruun S.B.", "AuthorID": "57204897098", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57188966849": {"Name": "Kristensen N.R.", "AuthorID": "57188966849", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "55918945400": {"Name": "Cronin-Fenton D.", "AuthorID": "55918945400", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "8435483700": {"Name": "Pedersen A.B.", "AuthorID": "8435483700", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital"}}}
