All rights reserved.Introduction In the era of direct-Acting antivirals, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 3 remains as the most difficult-to-treat HCV-GT. Currently, data on the efficacy of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF/LDV+RBV) in GT3-infected patients are limited. We investigated the efficacy of this regimen in a real-life cohort from Austria. Patients and methods A total of 55 patients with HCV-GT3 and compensated liver disease (20% treatment-experienced, 33% with cirrhosis, 7% with HIV coinfection) from four Austrian hepatitis centers received treatment with SOF/LDV+RBV for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was sustained virological response 12 weeks after end of therapy (SVR12). Results In the modified intention-to-treat analysis-excluding patients lost to follow-up-The overall SVR12 rate was 94% (95% confidence interval: 84-99%). In treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, SVR12 rates were 95 and 89%, respectively. SVR12 rate was 91% in patients without cirrhosis and 100% in patients with cirrhosis. There were no serious adverse events. Viral sequencing did not show the presence of any resistance-Associated substitutions in any of the three relapsed patients. Conclusion Despite a very weak antiviral activity of ledipasvir against HCV-GT3 in vitro, a 12-week course of SOF/LDV+RBV was highly effective, with a 94% SVR12 rate in our cohort of compensated HCV-GT3-infected patients. Thus, if pangenotypic NS5A inhibitors are not available or not reimbursed by insurances, SOF/LDV+RBV seems to be an effective alternative in patients with HCV-GT3 infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["direct-Acting antivirals", "hepatitis C", "ledipasvir", "ribavirin", "sofosbuvir"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antiviral Agents", "Benzimidazoles", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Fluorenes", "Genotype", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Ribavirin", "Sustained Virologic Response", "Treatment Outcome", "Uridine Monophosphate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042349987", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"56490060100": {"Name": "Moser S.", "AuthorID": "56490060100", "AffiliationID": "60000713", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine IV, Wilhelminenspital"}, "56826145300": {"Name": "Gutic E.", "AuthorID": "56826145300", "AffiliationID": "60000713", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine IV, Wilhelminenspital"}, "57200760196": {"Name": "Lang T.", "AuthorID": "57200760196", "AffiliationID": "60000713", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine IV, Wilhelminenspital"}, "56490223300": {"Name": "Schleicher M.", "AuthorID": "56490223300", "AffiliationID": "60000713", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine IV, Wilhelminenspital"}, "26426031800": {"Name": "Gschwantler M.", "AuthorID": "26426031800", "AffiliationID": "60003041", "AffiliationName": "Sigmund Freud University Vienna"}, "51663572000": {"Name": "Kozbial K.", "AuthorID": "51663572000", "AffiliationID": "113000943", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "113000943", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "113000943", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University"}, "6603354426": {"Name": "Steindl-Munda P.", "AuthorID": "6603354426", "AffiliationID": "113000943", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University"}, "7101836598": {"Name": "Ferenci P.", "AuthorID": "7101836598", "AffiliationID": "113000943", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine III, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Medical University"}, "55832769000": {"Name": "Laferl H.", "AuthorID": "55832769000", "AffiliationID": "60013678", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine IV, Kaiser-Franz-Josef-Spital"}, "57200757742": {"Name": "Sch\u00fctz A.", "AuthorID": "57200757742", "AffiliationID": "116400167", "AffiliationName": "Suchthilfe Wien GGmbH, Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien"}, "57200759673": {"Name": "Schwanke C.", "AuthorID": "57200759673", "AffiliationID": "116400167", "AffiliationName": "Suchthilfe Wien GGmbH, Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien"}, "57200762578": {"Name": "Schubert R.", "AuthorID": "57200762578", "AffiliationID": "116400167", "AffiliationName": "Suchthilfe Wien GGmbH, Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien"}, "57200757351": {"Name": "Luhn J.", "AuthorID": "57200757351", "AffiliationID": "116400167", "AffiliationName": "Suchthilfe Wien GGmbH, Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien"}, "7801445766": {"Name": "Haltmayer H.", "AuthorID": "7801445766", "AffiliationID": "116400167", "AffiliationName": "Suchthilfe Wien GGmbH, Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien"}}}
