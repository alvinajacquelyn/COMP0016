The complex interplay between domains, whereby each domain can act as a determinant, indicator and/or outcome of social exclusion, hinders understanding of the process and the mechanisms through which social exclusion exists. This article highlights the need to disentangle these pathways and move beyond descriptive accounts of social exclusion, presenting a new working framework that allows direct hypothesis testing of these between-domain relationships. Whilst this working framework can be applied to any population, this article focuses on older adults. Life events that can drive social exclusion such as bereavement and changes in health are more likely to occur in later life, and occur more frequently, increasing the risk of social exclusion for this population. Rooted in the new working framework, this article presents the construction of later life social exclusion measures for use with Understanding Society - the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study. The validity of these measures are considered by examining the characteristics of those aged 65 years and over who score the highest, and therefore experience the greatest level of exclusion. This new working framework and developed social exclusion measures provide a platform from which to explore the complex relationships between domains of social exclusion and ultimately provide a clearer understanding of this intricate multi-dimensional process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["older adults", "social exclusion", "survey data", "Understanding Society", "United Kingdom", "United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS)", "working framework"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030720285", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57194541889": {"Name": "MacLeod C.", "AuthorID": "57194541889", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Services Development Centre Wales, School of Healthcare Sciences, Ardudwy, Bangor University"}, "12243150500": {"Name": "Windle G.", "AuthorID": "12243150500", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Services Development Centre Wales, School of Healthcare Sciences, Ardudwy, Bangor University"}, "57207062542": {"Name": "Ross A.", "AuthorID": "57207062542", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60099295", "AffiliationName": "ESRC International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health (ICLS), Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603689750": {"Name": "Sacker A.", "AuthorID": "6603689750", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60099295", "AffiliationName": "ESRC International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health (ICLS), Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "9233259300": {"Name": "Netuveli G.", "AuthorID": "9233259300", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Health and Human Development, University of East London"}}}
