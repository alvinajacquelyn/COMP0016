We demonstrate ThermSense, a new breathing sensing platform based on smartphone technology and low-cost thermal camera, which allows a user to measure his/her breathing pattern in a contact-free manner. With the designed key functions of Thermal Voxel Integration-based breathing estimation and respiration variability spectrogram (RVS, bi-dimensional representation of breathing dynamics), the developed platform provides scalability and flexibility for gathering respiratory physiological measurements ubiquitously. The functionality could be used for a variety of applications from stress monitoring to respiration training.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Breathing patterns", "Contact free", "Dimensional representation", "Physiological measurement", "Sensing platforms", "Spectrograms", "Stress monitoring", "Thermal camera"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047272376", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57196019045": {"Name": "Cho Y.", "AuthorID": "57196019045", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Bianchi-Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003972937": {"Name": "Julier S.", "AuthorID": "7003972937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55921115600": {"Name": "Marquardt N.", "AuthorID": "55921115600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
