The provocations of teachers, the cupidity of mestizo caciques, rebel violence and Huichol commitment to preserving communal autonomy undermined alliances between Huichol leaders and federal officials, and led to the ultimate failure of the government's project. If anything, the short-lived Revolutionary education programme equipped a new generation of Huichol leaders with the tools to better resist external assimilatory pressures into the 1940s and beyond.", "AuthorKeywords": ["assimilation", "Cristero rebellion", "education", "Huichols", "Mexican Revolution", "state-building"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032513679", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"56080360700": {"Name": "Morris N.", "AuthorID": "56080360700", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Nathaniel Morris, Research Fellow, University of Warwick"}}}
