All rights reserved.A 69-year-old man who presented with abdominal discomfort was, on examination, found to have a palpable abdominal mass. Contrast-enhanced CT showed a mass arising from the inferior vena cava, which biopsy confirmed to be a leiomyosarcoma. One month after chemoradiotherapy, CT demonstrated a new 15 mm solitary central right liver metastasis. Microwave ablation (MWA) of the metastasis was performed using an Acculis Sulis V system (Angiodynamics, USA) at a power of 140 Watts for 4 min, with no immediate complications. After 1 month, MRI with gadolinium was performed to assess the liver ablation zone. The MRI demonstrated thrombosis of a right inferior hepatic vein branch leading to the ablation zone and extension of the ablation zone 1 cm into the tissue around the thrombosed vessel.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Hepatic Veins", "Humans", "Leiomyosarcoma", "Liver Neoplasms", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Microwaves", "Thrombosis", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Treatment Outcome", "Vascular Neoplasms", "Vena Cava, Inferior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963769782", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57183312200": {"Name": "Singh S.", "AuthorID": "57183312200", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Oncology Service, University College Hospital, University College London"}, "56053957500": {"Name": "Johnston E.W.", "AuthorID": "56053957500", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Oncology Service, University College Hospital, University College London"}, "35775945600": {"Name": "Bandula S.", "AuthorID": "35775945600", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Oncology Service, University College Hospital, University College London"}, "15754175900": {"Name": "Illing R.O.", "AuthorID": "15754175900", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Oncology Service, University College Hospital, University College London"}, "13205390800": {"Name": "Siriwardana P.N.", "AuthorID": "13205390800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Hepatopancreatobiliary and Liver Transplant Surgery Unit, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Hepatopancreatobiliary and Liver Transplant Surgery Unit, Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}}}
