While ultrasound is widely used in clinical practice for real-time guidance, the image contrast that it provides can be insufficient for visualizing tissue structures such as blood vessels, nerves, and tumors. This study was centered on the development of a photoacoustic imaging system for interventional procedures that delivered excitation light in the ranges of 750 to 900 nm and 1150 to 1300 nm, with an optical fiber positioned in a needle cannula. Coregistered B-mode ultrasound images were obtained. The system, which was based on a commercial ultrasound imaging scanner, has an axial resolution in the vicinity of 100 \u03bcm and a submillimeter, depth-dependent lateral resolution. Using a tissue phantom and 800 nm excitation light, a simulated blood vessel could be visualized at a maximum distance of 15 mm from the needle tip. Spectroscopic contrast for hemoglobin and lipids was observed with ex vivo tissue samples, with photoacoustic signal maxima consistent with the respective optical absorption spectra. The potential for further optimization of the system is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["image guidance", "interventional procedures", "photoacoustic imaging", "spectroscopy", "ultrasound imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["B-mode ultrasound images", "Image guidances", "Interventional procedures", "Lateral resolution", "Performance characteristics", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Photoacoustic signals", "Ultrasound imaging", "Elasticity Imaging Techniques", "Equipment Design", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Molecular Imaging", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Photoacoustic Techniques", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Spectrum Analysis", "Surgery, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939215944", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"36337500900": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "36337500900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "57188642825": {"Name": "Nikitichev D.I.", "AuthorID": "57188642825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "24344561500": {"Name": "Mari J.M.", "AuthorID": "24344561500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.C.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "55840844300": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "55840844300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "55820371500": {"Name": "West S.J.", "AuthorID": "55820371500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital, Department of Anaesthesia, Main Theatres"}, "56780998200": {"Name": "Pratt R.", "AuthorID": "56780998200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women's Health"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Center for Medical Imaging Computing"}}}
