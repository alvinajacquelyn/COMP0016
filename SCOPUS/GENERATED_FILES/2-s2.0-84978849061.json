However, the potential toxicity of QDs has remained a major obstacle to their clinical use because they commonly incorporate the toxic heavy metal cadmium within the core of the QDs. In this work, we have evaluated a novel type of heavy metal-free/cadmium-free and biocompatible QD nanoparticles (bio CFQD\u00ae nanoparticles) with a good photoluminescence quantum yield. Sentinel lymph node mapping is an increasingly important treatment option in the management of breast cancer. We have demonstrated their potential for lymph node mapping by ex vivo imaging of regional lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection in the paw of rats. Using photoluminescence imaging and chemical extraction measurements based on elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, the quantum dots are shown to accumulate quickly and selectively in the axillary and thoracic regional lymph nodes. In addition, lifetime imaging microscopy of the QD photoluminescence indicates minimal perturbation to their photoluminescence properties in biological systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Heavy metal-free quantum dots", "Nanoparticles", "Nanotechnology", "Photoluminescence", "Sentinel lymph node"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Cancer", "Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopies", "Photoluminescence imaging", "Photoluminescence properties", "Photoluminescence quantum yields", "Photophysical properties", "Sentinel lymph node mapping", "Sentinel lymph nodes", "Animals", "Female", "Indium", "Luminescent Measurements", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Metals, Heavy", "Quantum Dots", "Rats", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Sentinel Lymph Node", "Tissue Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978849061", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"26636178300": {"Name": "Yaghini E.", "AuthorID": "26636178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science and Institute of Healthcare Engineering, University College London"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "MacRobert A.J.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science and Institute of Healthcare Engineering, University College London"}, "57190278720": {"Name": "Turner H.D.", "AuthorID": "57190278720", "AffiliationID": "60111927", "AffiliationName": "Nanoco Technologies Ltd."}, "6603589574": {"Name": "Naasani I.", "AuthorID": "6603589574", "AffiliationID": "60111927", "AffiliationName": "Nanoco Technologies Ltd."}, "56479216200": {"Name": "Le Marois A.M.", "AuthorID": "56479216200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King's College London"}, "6701805003": {"Name": "Suhling K.", "AuthorID": "6701805003", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, King's College London"}}}
