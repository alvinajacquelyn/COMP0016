Small molecules cross the NPC by passive diffusion, but molecules larger than \u223c5nm must bind to nuclear transport receptors to overcome a selective barrier within the NPC. Although the structure and shape of the cytoplasmic ring of the NPC are relatively well characterized, the selective barrier is situated deep within the central channel of the NPC and depends critically on unstructured nuclear pore proteins, and is therefore not well understood. Here, we show that stiffness topography with sharp atomic force microscopy tips can generate nanoscale cross-sections of the NPC. The cross-sections reveal two distinct structures, a cytoplasmic ring and a central plug structure, which are consistent with the three-dimensional NPC structure derived from electron microscopy. The central plug persists after reactivation of the transport cycle and resultant cargo release, indicating that the plug is an intrinsic part of the NPC barrier. Added nuclear transport receptors accumulate on the intact transport barrier and lead to a homogenization of the barrier stiffness. The observed nanomechanical properties in the NPC indicate the presence of a cohesive barrier to transport and are quantitatively consistent with the presence of a central condensate of nuclear pore proteins in the NPC channel.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic force microscopy tips", "Central channels", "Nanomechanical property", "Nuclear pore complexes", "Nuclear transport", "Passive diffusions", "Selective barriers", "Transport barrier", "Active Transport, Cell Nucleus", "Adhesiveness", "Adsorption", "Elastic Modulus", "Friction", "Materials Testing", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Nanoparticles", "Nuclear Pore", "Stress, Mechanical", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926103718", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55313630200": {"Name": "Bestembayeva A.", "AuthorID": "55313630200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57198277205": {"Name": "Kramer A.", "AuthorID": "57198277205", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology II, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "55263532900": {"Name": "Osmanovi\u0107 D.", "AuthorID": "55263532900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203260116": {"Name": "Ford I.J.", "AuthorID": "57203260116", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57208458979": {"Name": "Charras G.", "AuthorID": "57208458979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6701845862": {"Name": "Hoogenboom B.W.", "AuthorID": "6701845862", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23019356700": {"Name": "Liashkovich I.", "AuthorID": "23019356700", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology II, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "55341787000": {"Name": "Labokha A.A.", "AuthorID": "55341787000", "AffiliationID": "60005634, 60101501", "AffiliationName": "MedImmune"}, "6701807360": {"Name": "Fassati A.", "AuthorID": "6701807360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wohl Virion Centre, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56961714600": {"Name": "Orlova E.V.", "AuthorID": "56961714600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology"}}}
