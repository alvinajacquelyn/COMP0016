Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdPurpose: To determine the spectrum of BEST1 mutations and to study the phenotype in Slovenian families with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD) to identify genotype\u2013phenotype correlations. Methods: Twenty patients from five families underwent the ophthalmological examination including electrooculogram (EOG; N = 17), fundus autofluorescence imaging (N = 16) and optical coherence tomography (N = 14). Mutational screening was performed by direct DNA sequencing of the BEST1 gene. Results: Mutation c.43G>C (p.Gly15Arg) was detected in three patients from family M presenting with different clinical stages of Best disease. Mutation c.313G>C (p.Arg105Gly) was found in families K, ST, S, B and was associated with incomplete clinical penetrance and variable retinal changes, including extramacular and multifocal lesions. In three patients from family K, an atypical form of BVMD was observed; there were additional peripheral lesions outside of the vascular arcades in addition to the typical macular lesions. Multiple alterations between the vitelliruptive and pseudohypopyon stages over a period of 11 years were seen in one patient. Conclusion: Two previously unreported disease-associated variants in the BEST1 gene (p.Gly15Arg and p.Arg105Gly) were found in Slovenian patients with Best disease. Our data expand the mutation spectrum of the BEST1 gene and further support the broad phenotypic variability observed clinically and with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and AF imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["best vitelliform macular dystrophy", "BEST1 gene", "clinical phenotype", "genetic eye disease", "mutation detection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Chloride Channels", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Electrooculography", "Exons", "Eye Proteins", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation, Missense", "Optical Imaging", "Pedigree", "Slovenia", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995970213", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"7003792509": {"Name": "Glava\u010d D.", "AuthorID": "7003792509", "AffiliationID": "60021802, 60031106", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana"}, "55933637500": {"Name": "Vrabec K.", "AuthorID": "55933637500", "AffiliationID": "60021802, 60031106", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana"}, "7004159378": {"Name": "Ravnik-Glava\u010d M.", "AuthorID": "7004159378", "AffiliationID": "60021802, 60031106", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana"}, "6507563069": {"Name": "Jarc-Vidmar M.", "AuthorID": "6507563069", "AffiliationID": "60021479", "AffiliationName": "Eye Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana"}, "54925831800": {"Name": "Fakin A.", "AuthorID": "54925831800", "AffiliationID": "60021479", "AffiliationName": "Eye Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana"}, "6603582006": {"Name": "Hawlina M.", "AuthorID": "6603582006", "AffiliationID": "60021479", "AffiliationName": "Eye Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana"}}}
