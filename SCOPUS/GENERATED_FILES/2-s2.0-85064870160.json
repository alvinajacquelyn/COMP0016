Although DNA at some decommissioned embryonic enhancers is hypomethylated in adult cells, it is unknown whether this putative epigenetic memory is complete and recoverable. We find that, in adult mouse cells, hypomethylated CpG dinucleotides preserve a nearly complete archive of tissue-specific developmental enhancers. Sites that carry the active histone mark H3K4me1, and are therefore considered \u201cprimed,\u201d are mainly cis elements that act late in organogenesis. In contrast, sites decommissioned early in development retain hypomethylated DNA as a singular property. In adult intestinal and blood cells, sustained absence of polycomb repressive complex 2 indirectly reactivates most\u2014and only\u2014hypomethylated developmental enhancers. Embryonic and fetal transcriptional programs re-emerge as a result, in reverse chronology to cis element inactivation during development. Thus, hypomethylated DNA in adult cells preserves a \u201cfossil record\u201d of tissue-specific developmental enhancers, stably marking decommissioned sites and enabling recovery of this epigenetic memory.\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.Although cells decommission embryonic enhancers by erasing histone marks, these regions retain hypomethylated DNA into adulthood, preserving an accurate archive of tissue-specific developmental cis elements. This epigenetic memory is recovered after prolonged absence of polycomb repressive complex 2, when transcription factors selectively reactivate hypomethylated developmental enhancers and their tissue-restricted target genes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["decommissioned developmental genes", "DNA hypomethylation", "epigenetic memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "DNA Methylation", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Epigenomics", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Histones", "Mice"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064870160", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"8256184000": {"Name": "Jadhav U.", "AuthorID": "8256184000", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School"}, "55365170800": {"Name": "Cavazza A.", "AuthorID": "55365170800", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School"}, "57209111715": {"Name": "Banerjee K.K.", "AuthorID": "57209111715", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School"}, "57188926554": {"Name": "O'Neill N.K.", "AuthorID": "57188926554", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology and Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "56960653000": {"Name": "Madha S.", "AuthorID": "56960653000", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology and Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "7006543399": {"Name": "Shivdasani R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006543399", "AffiliationID": "60027452", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Stem Cell Institute"}, "7401673520": {"Name": "Xie H.", "AuthorID": "7401673520", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School"}, "35466034100": {"Name": "Orkin S.H.", "AuthorID": "35466034100", "AffiliationID": "60027452", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Stem Cell Institute"}, "35620919100": {"Name": "Saenz-Vash V.", "AuthorID": "35620919100", "AffiliationID": "60006840", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research"}, "7202968317": {"Name": "Zhai H.", "AuthorID": "7202968317", "AffiliationID": "60006840", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research"}, "56943286400": {"Name": "Herbert Z.", "AuthorID": "56943286400", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Biology Core Facility, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}}}
