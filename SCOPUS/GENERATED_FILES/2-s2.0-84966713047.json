Our incomplete understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS) may explain why, to date, there is no definitive imaging or laboratory test that is able to inform us when the disease is clearly entering into a progressive phase and why the vast majority of clinical trials testing immunosuppressant and immunomodulating drugs in SPMS patients has so far yielded disappointing or mixed results. Here we discuss the definition(s) of SPMS and how it may vary, outcome measurements (current and emerging) and modern trial design.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966713047", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"26538821100": {"Name": "Plantone D.", "AuthorID": "26538821100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35788048200": {"Name": "De Angelis F.", "AuthorID": "35788048200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57189253213": {"Name": "Doshi A.", "AuthorID": "57189253213", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57212501583": {"Name": "Chataway J.", "AuthorID": "57212501583", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
