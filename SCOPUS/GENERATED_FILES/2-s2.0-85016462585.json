However, there remains a limited understanding of the changes that BIM introduces to the structure of inter-organizational communication and its impact on project participants\u2019 roles and relationships. In this study, these issues are addressed through a comparative study of two construction projects in Greece: one that utilized BIM, and one that did not. Social network analysis (SNA) was employed as an analytical method to examine the inter-organizational communication networks in relation to two types of information exchange\u2013design development and cost management during the design stages of the two projects. Comparative SNA studies were conducted focusing on network density, tie strength, path length, and actor centrality. The research findings revealed the capacity for BIM to improve inter-organizational communication with the BIM-enabled project, exhibiting a higher density of communication, stronger ties, and shorter path lengths between project participants, indicating timely access to higher quality of information. The findings also identified the high centrality of the \u2018BIM manager\u2019 and \u2018BIM coordinator\u2019, demonstrating the effectiveness of these two new roles in managing the flow of communication in construction teams.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building information modelling (BIM)", "communication networks", "construction industry", "Greece", "social network analysis (SNA)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building Information Modelling", "Comparative studies", "Construction projects", "Greece", "Information exchanges", "Inter-organizational", "Project participants", "Quality of information"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016462585", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"56829337100": {"Name": "Badi S.", "AuthorID": "56829337100", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett, School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "57193769369": {"Name": "Diamantidou D.", "AuthorID": "57193769369", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett, School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}}}
