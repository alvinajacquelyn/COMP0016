Conventional methods that are used to estimate tumor size in mouse models fail to provide fast and reliable volumetric data for tumors grown non-subcutaneously. Here, we evaluated the use of iodine-staining combined with micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to estimate the tumor volume of ex vivo tumor-burdened lungs. We obtained fast high spatial resolution three-dimensional information of the lungs, and we demonstrated that iodine-staining highlights tumors and unhealthy tissue. We processed iodine-stained lungs for histopathological analysis with routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. We compared the traditional tumor burden estimation performed manually with H&E histological slices with a semi-automated method using micro-CT datasets. In mouse models that develop lung tumors with well precise boundaries, the method that we describe here enables to perform a quick estimation of tumorous tissue volume in micro-CT images. Our method overestimates the tumor burden in tumors surrounded by abnormal tissue, while traditional histopathological analysis underestimates tumor volume. We propose to embed micro-CT imaging to the traditional workflow of tumorous lung analyses in preclinical cancer research as a strategy to obtain a more accurate estimation of the total lung tumor burden.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Contrast Media", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Lung", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice", "Tumor Burden", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061025225", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56520312700": {"Name": "Bidola P.", "AuthorID": "56520312700", "AffiliationID": "60117815, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Munich School of Bioengineering, Technical University of Munich"}, "55855743300": {"Name": "Martins de Souza e Silva J.", "AuthorID": "55855743300", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenberg"}, "6602620431": {"Name": "Achterhold K.", "AuthorID": "6602620431", "AffiliationID": "60117815, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Munich School of Bioengineering, Technical University of Munich"}, "57205671933": {"Name": "Taphorn K.", "AuthorID": "57205671933", "AffiliationID": "60117815, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Munich School of Bioengineering, Technical University of Munich"}, "7102420628": {"Name": "Pfeiffer F.", "AuthorID": "7102420628", "AffiliationID": "60118140, 60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich"}, "16230000800": {"Name": "Herzen J.", "AuthorID": "16230000800", "AffiliationID": "60117815, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Munich School of Bioengineering, Technical University of Munich"}, "57188880501": {"Name": "Munkhbaatar E.", "AuthorID": "57188880501", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60000291, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "III.
