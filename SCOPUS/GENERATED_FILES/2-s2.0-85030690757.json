The developed drug delivery systems offered successful co-encapsulation of paracetamol and indomethacin with high drug encapsulation efficiencies of 54% and 69% for paracetamol and indomethacin, respectively. The developed formulations were further characterised with respect to their morphology, drug release profile and possible interactions. In comparison to the release rate of the free indomethacin, the developed formulation resulted in enhanced dissolution rate of indomethacin. This study demonstrates a versatile polymeric platform where multiple drug encapsulation and co-delivery is made possible by utilizing co-axial electrohydrodynamic atomization. The proposed system offered high processing yield of 60\u201370%, as a single-step platform for preparation of fixed dose formulations for oral drug delivery, particularly in geriatric therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drug delivery", "Electrohydrodynamic atomization", "Oral", "Polypharmacy, fixed dose combination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Core/shell microparticles", "Drug delivery system", "Drug encapsulation efficiency", "Electrohydrodynamic atomization", "Enhanced dissolutions", "Fixed-dose combination", "Oral", "Oral drug delivery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030690757", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56368108000": {"Name": "Shams T.", "AuthorID": "56368108000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "55175510700": {"Name": "Parhizkar M.", "AuthorID": "55175510700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55336456200": {"Name": "Illangakoon U.", "AuthorID": "55336456200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57193742036": {"Name": "Orlu M.", "AuthorID": "57193742036", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, University College London School of Pharmacy"}}}
