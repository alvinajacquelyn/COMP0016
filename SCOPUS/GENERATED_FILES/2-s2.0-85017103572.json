Umbilical cord blood (UCB) has become a source of hematopoietic stem cells for transplantation but as we gain a better understanding of the characteristics of each immune cell that UCB contains, we will also be able to develop new cell therapies for cancer. In this review, we present what is currently known of the phenotype and functions of UCB NK cells and how these cells could be used in the future for cancer immunotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Hematopoietic stem cells", "Immunotherapy", "Natural killer cells", "Umbilical cord blood"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017103572", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55861155600": {"Name": "Sarvaria A.", "AuthorID": "55861155600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57201015291": {"Name": "Madrigal J.A.", "AuthorID": "57201015291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7004019930": {"Name": "Saudemont A.", "AuthorID": "7004019930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6508008574": {"Name": "Jawdat D.", "AuthorID": "6508008574", "AffiliationID": "60078536", "AffiliationName": "King Abdullah International Medical Research Center"}}}
