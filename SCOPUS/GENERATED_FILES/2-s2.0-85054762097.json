The College of Policing is in the process of developing three entry routes into the profession, one of which is a graduate conversion course for those new recruits who hold, at a minimum, a Bachelor\u2019s degree. The objective of this research was to gather evidence on existing conversion courses to inform the development of this route. A rapid evidence assessment was undertaken to a narrative synthesis of the literature on graduate conversion courses in other professions. Fifty-one studies were identified and coded. Four main themes emerged from the available evidence as being central. These themes\u2013learning styles, translating theory into practice, teaching methods and assessment were cross cut by pedagogical sub-themes of collaborative learning, and reflective practice. Policy and practice implications for a policing conversion course are drawn out to guide development and delivery of police training and education in the 21st century.", "AuthorKeywords": ["graduate conversion course", "police", "Rapid evidence assessment", "teaching"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054762097", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"26532370500": {"Name": "Belur J.", "AuthorID": "26532370500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "57204159718": {"Name": "Agnew-Pauley W.", "AuthorID": "57204159718", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "37102850600": {"Name": "Tompson L.", "AuthorID": "37102850600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
