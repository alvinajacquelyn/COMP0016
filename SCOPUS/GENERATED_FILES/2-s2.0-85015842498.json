Here we propose a new methodology to isolate chiral signals removing the achiral background from two commonly used configurations for performing two-dimensional optical spectroscopy, known as BOXCARS and gradient assisted photon echo spectroscopy (GRAPES). It is found that in both cases an achiral signal from an isotropic system can be completely eliminated by small manipulations of the relative angles between the linear polarizations of the four input laser pulses. Starting from the formulation of a perturbative expansion of the signal in the angle between the beams and the propagation axis, we derive analytic expressions that can be used to estimate how to change the polarization angles of the four pulses to minimize achiral contributions in the studied configurations. The generalization to any other possible experimental configurations has also been discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analytic expressions", "Linear polarization", "Linearly polarized light", "Perturbative expansion", "Photon-echo spectroscopy", "Polarization angle", "Time-resolved spectroscopy", "Two-dimensional optical spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015842498", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56003750400": {"Name": "Holdaway D.", "AuthorID": "56003750400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603420246": {"Name": "Olaya-Castro A.", "AuthorID": "6603420246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8648300900": {"Name": "Collini E.", "AuthorID": "8648300900", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Sciences, University of Padova"}}}
