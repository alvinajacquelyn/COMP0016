In 2014, 88.6% of prevalent HD patients achieved a URR .65%. The between centre range of prevalent patients achieving this target was wide (74.9- 97.0%). The median URR in 2014 was 75%. URR was greater in those with longer dialysis vintage, with 91.2% of patients who had survived on renal replacement therapy (RRT) for more than two years achieving a URR .65% compared with only 73.4% of those on RRT for less than six months. Large variation between centres in the percentage of patients achieving the UK Renal Association's (RA) URR guideline persists.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adequacy", "Haemodialysis", "Urea reduction ratio"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Registries", "Renal Dialysis", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966283927", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "7402630087": {"Name": "Shaw C.", "AuthorID": "7402630087", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "King's College Hospital"}, "12800982100": {"Name": "Steenkamp R.", "AuthorID": "12800982100", "AffiliationID": "60016447, 60116280", "AffiliationName": "UK Renal Registry, Southmead Hospital"}}}
