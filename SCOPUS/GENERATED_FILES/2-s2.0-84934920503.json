Using the common pathogenic E342K (Z) variant of \u03b11-antitrypsin as antigen - whose native state is susceptible to the formation of a proto-oligomeric intermediate - we have produced a mAb (5E3) that increases the rate of oligomerization of the wild-type (M) variant. Employing ELISA, gel shift, thermal stability and FRET time-course experiments, we show that mAb5E3 does not bind to the native state of \u03b11-antitrypsin, but recognizes a cryptic epitope in the vicinity of the post-helix A loop and strand 4C that is revealed upon transition to the polymerization intermediate, and which persists in the ensuing oligomer. This epitope is not shared by loop-inserted monomeric conformations. We show the increased amenity to polymerization by either the pathogenic E342K mutation or the binding of mAb5E3 occurs without affecting the energetic barrier to polymerization. As mAb5E3 also does not alter the relative stability of the monomer to intermediate, it acts in a manner similar to the E342K mutant, by facilitating the conformational interchange between these two states.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregation", "Antibody", "Polymerization", "Protein stability", "\u03b11-antitrypsin"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha 1-Antitrypsin", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived", "Antibody Specificity", "Epitopes", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Multimerization", "Protein Stability", "Protein Structure, Quaternary", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934920503", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"26643229900": {"Name": "Irving J.A.", "AuthorID": "26643229900", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "35487611700": {"Name": "Haq I.", "AuthorID": "35487611700", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "55780640400": {"Name": "Faull S.V.", "AuthorID": "55780640400", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "35105591000": {"Name": "Motamedi-Shad N.", "AuthorID": "35105591000", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "35391622600": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "35391622600", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "8377905200": {"Name": "Miranda E.", "AuthorID": "8377905200", "AffiliationID": "60032350, 60105089", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biotechnologies 'Charles Darwin', Pasteur Institute, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7403417807": {"Name": "Perez J.", "AuthorID": "7403417807", "AffiliationID": "60003662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Genetics and Animal Physiology, University of Malaga, Campus de Teatinos"}, "56708148100": {"Name": "Kotov V.R.", "AuthorID": "56708148100", "AffiliationID": "60028970, 60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Rutgers University"}}}
