Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Groups of indicators are suggested as a means of evaluating each component of the system. The paper proposes a means of using these to identify which parts of the system are most in need of development and additional resources, something that will also depend on local hazards, vulnerabilities and priorities. In order to illustrate the methodology, an example is presented from the town Teziutl\u00e1n in the central Mexican state of Puebla. Findings \u2013 The civil protection system of Teziutl\u00e1n is in the midst of a long, difficult and uneven phase of growth, in which there are both encouraging developments and seriously neglected elements. Analysis of Teziutl\u00e1n using the indicators listed in the preceding methodological section enables a model to be proposed for the emergence of a system of emergency preparedness and response at the local level. Research limitations/implications \u2013 This paper proposes a simple methodology and uses one very modest example to illustrate it. However, civil protection systems at many scales and in many countries would benefit from evaluation of their strengths and weaknesses. Practical implications \u2013 It is hoped that this will be of use to those who wish to evaluate the development of local and regional civil protection elsewhere in the world. Social implications \u2013 Improvement of response capabilities is crucial to the development of a better civil protection system and the protection of the population against disaster. Originality/value \u2013 Although assessment is widely used in science, technology and business, it has rarely been applied systematically to emergency management and civil protection systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Civil protection", "Disaster response", "Emergency preparedness", "Indicators", "Mexico"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924350740", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"7402830661": {"Name": "Alexander D.E.", "AuthorID": "7402830661", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}}}
