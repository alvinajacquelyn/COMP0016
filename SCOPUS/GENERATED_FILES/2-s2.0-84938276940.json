ENT3 is a member of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) family whose primary function is mediating transport of nucleosides and nucleobases. The aims of this study were to characterise ENT3 expression in islet \u03b2-cells and identify the effects of its depletion on \u03b2-cell mitochondrial activity and apoptosis. RT-PCR amplification identified ENT3 expression in human and mouse islets and exocrine pancreas, and in MIN6 \u03b2-cells. Immunohistochemistry using human and mouse pancreas sections exhibited extensive ENT3 immunostaining of \u03b2-cells, which was confirmed by co-staining with an anti-insulin antibody. In addition, exposure of dispersed human islet cells and MIN6 \u03b2-cells to MitoTracker and an ENT3 antibody showed co-localisation of ENT3 to \u03b2-cell mitochondria. Consistent with this, Western blot analysis confirmed enhanced ENT3 immunoreactivity in \u03b2-cell mitochondria-enriched fractions. Furthermore, ENT3 depletion in \u03b2-cells increased mitochondrial DNA content and promoted an energy crisis characterised by enhanced ATP-linked respiration and proton leak. Finally, inhibition of ENT3 activity by dypridamole and depletion of ENT3 by siRNA-induced knockdown resulted in increased caspase 3/7 activities in \u03b2-cells. These observations demonstrate that ENT3 is predominantly expressed by islet \u03b2-cells where it co-localises with mitochondria. Depletion of ENT3 causes mitochondrial dysfunction which is associated with enhanced \u03b2-cell apoptosis. Thus, apoptotic loss of islet \u03b2-cells may contribute to the occurrence of autoantibody-negative insulin-dependent diabetes in individuals with non-functional ENT3 mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Diabetes", "Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3", "Islets of langerhans", "Mitochondria", "\u03b2-Cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938276940", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55574235637": {"Name": "Liu B.", "AuthorID": "55574235637", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Group, Division of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, King's College London"}, "57126984900": {"Name": "Czajka A.", "AuthorID": "57126984900", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Group, Division of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, King's College London"}, "7402152949": {"Name": "Malik A.N.", "AuthorID": "7402152949", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Group, Division of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, King's College London"}, "57210860018": {"Name": "Jones P.M.", "AuthorID": "57210860018", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Group, Division of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, King's College London"}, "7005195615": {"Name": "Persaud S.J.", "AuthorID": "7005195615", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Group, Division of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Life and Medical Sciences, King's College London"}, "55399107800": {"Name": "Hussain K.", "AuthorID": "55399107800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}}}
