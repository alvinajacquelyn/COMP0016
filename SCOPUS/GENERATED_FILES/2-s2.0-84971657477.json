It has been suggested that QSM is more sensitive than the more conventional quantifiable MRI measure, namely the transverse relaxation rate, R2*. Here, we conducted the first high-resolution, whole-brain, simultaneously acquired, comparative study of the two techniques using 7 Tesla MRI. We asked which of the two techniques would be more sensitive to explore global differences in tissue composition in elderly adults relative to young subjects. Both QSM and R2* revealed strong age-related differences in subcortical regions, hippocampus and cortical grey matter, particularly in superior frontal regions, motor/premotor cortices, insula and cerebellar regions. Within the basal ganglia system\u2014but also hippocampus and cerebellar dentate nucleus\u2014, QSM was largely in agreement with R2* with the exception of the globus pallidus. QSM, however, provided superior anatomical contrast and revealed age-related differences in the thalamus and in white matter, which were otherwise largely undetected by R2* measurements. In contrast, in occipital cortex, age-related differences were much greater with R2* compared to QSM. The present study, therefore, demonstrated that in vivo QSM using ultra-high field MRI provides a novel means to characterise age-related differences in the human brain, but also combining QSM and R2* using multi-gradient recalled echo imaging can potentially provide a more complete picture of mineralisation, demyelination and/or vascular alterations in aging and disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Brain iron", "Brain mineralisation", "Cortex", "Quantitative susceptibility mapping", "R2* mapping", "Subcortical grey matter", "White matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Algorithms", "Brain", "Female", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multimodal Imaging", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971657477", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36840399500": {"Name": "Betts M.", "AuthorID": "36840399500", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "8235719600": {"Name": "Acosta-Cabronero J.", "AuthorID": "8235719600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "6508147821": {"Name": "Cardenas-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "6508147821", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"}, "57189881899": {"Name": "Nestor P.", "AuthorID": "57189881899", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "6701771740": {"Name": "D\u00fczel E.", "AuthorID": "6701771740", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
