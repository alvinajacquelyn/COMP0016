We examined the impact of ageing on the ultrastructure and function of mitochondria in mouse and fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) by electron cryo-tomography and respirometry. We discovered distinct age-related changes in both model organisms. Mitochondrial function and ultrastructure are maintained in mouse heart, whereas subpopulations of mitochondria from mouse liver show age-related changes in membrane morphology. Subpopulations of mitochondria from young and old mouse kidney resemble those described for apoptosis. In aged flies, respiratory activity is compromised and the production of peroxide radicals is increased. In about 50% of mitochondria from old flies, the inner membrane organization breaks down. This establishes a clear link between inner membrane architecture and functional decline. Mitochondria were affected by ageing to very different extents, depending on the organism and possibly on the degree to which tissues within the same organism are protected against mitochondrial damage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Energy Metabolism", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Organ Specificity", "Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029209728", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7103109701": {"Name": "Brandt T.", "AuthorID": "7103109701", "AffiliationID": "60020952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural Biology, Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysics"}, "7006010107": {"Name": "K\u00fchlbrandt W.", "AuthorID": "7006010107", "AffiliationID": "60020952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural Biology, Max-Planck-Institute of Biophysics"}, "23467084200": {"Name": "Mourier A.", "AuthorID": "23467084200", "AffiliationID": "60102592, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, Institut de Biochimie et G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Cellulaires UMR 5095"}, "23009359300": {"Name": "Larsson N.", "AuthorID": "23009359300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "24173766800": {"Name": "Tain L.", "AuthorID": "24173766800", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Mechanisms of Ageing, Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}}}
