Display energy certificates are a source of observed building \u201cbehavior\u201d in the United Kingdom, and machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, can predict global behavior in complex systems, such as buildings. In view of this, artificial neural networks, a machine learning technique, were trained to predict annual thermal (gas) and electrical energy use of building designs, based on a range of collected design and briefing parameters. As a demonstrative case, the research focused on school design in England. Mean absolute percentage errors of 22.9% and 22.5% for annual thermal and electrical energy use predictions, respectively, were achieved. This is an improvement of 9.1% for the prediction of annual thermal energy use and 24.5% for the prediction of annual electrical energy use when compared to sources evidencing the current performance gap.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Architectural concepts", "Current performance", "Electrical energy", "Energy consumption prediction", "Machine learning techniques", "Mean absolute percentage error", "Prediction methods", "Thermal energy use"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019051403", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57213310878": {"Name": "Paterson G.", "AuthorID": "57213310878", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett, Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "14040664500": {"Name": "Mumovic D.", "AuthorID": "14040664500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett, Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, University College London"}, "56418836000": {"Name": "Das P.", "AuthorID": "56418836000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "54393240600": {"Name": "Kimpian J.", "AuthorID": "54393240600", "AffiliationID": "117783934", "AffiliationName": "Director of Sustainable Architecture and Research, AHR"}}}
