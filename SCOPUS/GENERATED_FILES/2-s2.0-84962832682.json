A key facet of the working method is the inspection meeting with the school board. Drawing upon a large quantitative study (n = 244) we are able to identify some changes in school board governance due to these inspection meetings. School boards that had an inspection meeting indicate changes in their governance of quality assurance and data use, and in the amount of data that they collect on the functioning of their schools. School boards indicate very small amounts of activities with regard to the curriculum and instruction in their schools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dutch Inspectorate", "education", "governance", "school boards"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962832682", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"]], "AuthorData": {"8283638900": {"Name": "Ehren M.C.M.", "AuthorID": "8283638900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35068090500": {"Name": "Honingh M.E.", "AuthorID": "35068090500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "38261353500": {"Name": "Hooge E.H.", "AuthorID": "38261353500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "25032020100": {"Name": "O\u2019Hara J.", "AuthorID": "25032020100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
