In an effort to shift the current paradigm in dose and regimen selection and highlight the availability and usefulness of well-established and regulatory-acceptable methods, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in collaboration with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Association (EFPIA) hosted a multistakeholder workshop on dose finding (London 4-5 December 2014). Some methodologies that could constitute a toolkit for drug developers and regulators were presented. These methods are described in the present report: they include five advanced methods for data analysis (empirical regression models, pharmacometrics models, quantitative systems pharmacology models, MCP-Mod, and model averaging) and three methods for study design optimization (Fisher information matrix (FIM)-based methods, clinical trial simulations, and adaptive studies). Pairwise comparisons were also discussed during the workshop; however, mostly for historical reasons. This paper discusses the added value and limitations of these methods as well as challenges for their implementation. Some applications in different therapeutic areas are also summarized, in line with the discussions at the workshop. There was agreement at the workshop on the fact that selection of dose for phase III is an estimation problem and should not be addressed via hypothesis testing. Dose selection for phase III trials should be informed by well-designed dosefinding studies; however, the specific choice of method(s) will depend on several aspects and it is not possible to recommend a generalized decision tree. There are many valuable methods available, the methods are not mutually exclusive, and they should be used in conjunction to ensure a scientifically rigorous understanding of the dosing rationale.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025085004", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57220013073": {"Name": "Musuamba F.T.", "AuthorID": "57220013073", "AffiliationID": "60008447, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "UMR850 INSERM, Universite de Limoges"}, "6603589584": {"Name": "Manolis E.", "AuthorID": "6603589584", "AffiliationID": "60112036", "AffiliationName": "European Medicines Agency"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56492219000": {"Name": "Hay J.", "AuthorID": "56492219000", "AffiliationID": "60025465", "AffiliationName": "Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"}, "57217379731": {"Name": "Cole S.", "AuthorID": "57217379731", "AffiliationID": "60025465", "AffiliationName": "Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"}, "57192974669": {"Name": "Gigante V.", "AuthorID": "57192974669", "AffiliationID": "60103318", "AffiliationName": "Agenzia Italiana Del Farmaco"}, "7201472603": {"Name": "Karlsson K.", "AuthorID": "7201472603", "AffiliationID": "60018673", "AffiliationName": "Medical Products Agency"}, "7004431341": {"Name": "Benda N.", "AuthorID": "7004431341", "AffiliationID": "100339196", "AffiliationName": "Bundesinstitut fur Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte"}, "57195052121": {"Name": "Serone F.", "AuthorID": "57195052121", "AffiliationID": "60103318", "AffiliationName": "Agenzia Italiana Del Farmaco"}, "57195204677": {"Name": "Skottheim Rusten I.", "AuthorID": "57195204677", "AffiliationID": "101287505", "AffiliationName": "Norvegian Medicines Agency"}, "14121249400": {"Name": "Ehmann F.", "AuthorID": "14121249400", "AffiliationID": "60112036", "AffiliationName": "European Medicines Agency"}, "7006303755": {"Name": "Holford N.", "AuthorID": "7006303755", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Auckland"}, "57188569553": {"Name": "Cheung S.Y.A.", "AuthorID": "57188569553", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca UK Limited"}, "9333561100": {"Name": "Yates J.W.T.", "AuthorID": "9333561100", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca UK Limited"}, "55377464400": {"Name": "Corriol-Rohou S.", "AuthorID": "55377464400", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca UK Limited"}, "7406322452": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "7406322452", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "AstraZeneca UK Limited"}, "7102798678": {"Name": "Friberg L.E.", "AuthorID": "7102798678", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Uppsala University"}, "9246529700": {"Name": "Hooker A.C.", "AuthorID": "9246529700", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Uppsala University"}, "9845250600": {"Name": "Ogungbenro K.", "AuthorID": "9845250600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Manchester University"}, "7007119138": {"Name": "Posch M.", "AuthorID": "7007119138", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6701707614": {"Name": "Bretz F.", "AuthorID": "6701707614", "AffiliationID": "117739325", "AffiliationName": "Novartis"}, "35323734400": {"Name": "Berry S.", "AuthorID": "35323734400", "AffiliationID": "112435165", "AffiliationName": "Berry Consultants"}, "57196316144": {"Name": "Thomas N.", "AuthorID": "57196316144", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "35619398000": {"Name": "Bornkamp B.", "AuthorID": "35619398000", "AffiliationID": "117739325", "AffiliationName": "Novartis"}, "23492158500": {"Name": "Dumortier T.", "AuthorID": "23492158500", "AffiliationID": "117739325", "AffiliationName": "Novartis"}, "7003619834": {"Name": "Van Der Graaf P.H.", "AuthorID": "7003619834", "AffiliationID": "60111602", "AffiliationName": "Certara QSP"}, "56242571300": {"Name": "Hemmings R.", "AuthorID": "56242571300", "AffiliationID": "60025465", "AffiliationName": "Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"}, "36463184100": {"Name": "Brochot A.", "AuthorID": "36463184100", "AffiliationID": "60082488", "AffiliationName": "ABLYNX"}}}
