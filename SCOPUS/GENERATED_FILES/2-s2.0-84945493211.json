However, they are subject to multiple sources of uncertainty. Previous studies have analysed uncertainties using a local one-at-a-time approach, but this suffers from significant limitations. Here two global sensitivity analysis techniques, elementary effects and a variance-based method, have been employed to overcome these limitations. Correct understanding of model sensitivities matters, for interpreting findings and directing research to reduce uncertainties. Analysis of the Cambridge Housing Model, a Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP)-based housing energy model for England, finds good agreement between the global analyses but there are major differences compared with the local analysis. We identify SAP wall U-values and demand temperature as by far the most significant uncertain parameters; along with SAP roof, window and floor U-values these account for 96% of the observed variation in outputs. This could have major implications for national-level estimates of savings based on such models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cambridge Housing Model", "elementary effects", "global sensitivity analysis", "household energy", "uncertainty analysis", "variance-based analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["elementary effects", "Global sensitivity analysis", "Household energy", "Housing models", "Variance-based analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945493211", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"55353164700": {"Name": "Hughes M.", "AuthorID": "55353164700", "AffiliationID": "60112873", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Architectural Research"}, "57188566858": {"Name": "Palmer J.", "AuthorID": "57188566858", "AffiliationID": "60112873", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Architectural Research"}, "14028023000": {"Name": "Cheng V.", "AuthorID": "14028023000", "AffiliationID": "60117894, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Munich School of Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "6507200086": {"Name": "Shipworth D.", "AuthorID": "6507200086", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}}}
