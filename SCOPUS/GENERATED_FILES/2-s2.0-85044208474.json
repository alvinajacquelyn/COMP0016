Single-cell multicolour FISH was used to demonstrate that the earliest detectable leukaemia subclone contained the STIL-TAL1 fusion and copy number loss of 9p21.3 (CDKN2A/CDKN2B locus), with other copy number alterations including loss of PTEN occurring as secondary subclonal events. In three cases, multiplex qPCR and phylogenetic analysis were used to produce branching evolutionary trees recapitulating the snapshot history of T-ALL evolution in this leukaemia subtype, which confirmed that mutations in key T-ALL drivers, including NOTCH1 and PTEN, were subclonal and reiterative in distinct subclones. Xenografting confirmed that self-renewing or propagating cells were genetically diverse. These data suggest that the STIL-TAL1 fusion is a likely founder or truncal event. Therapies targeting the TAL1 auto-regulatory complex are worthy of further investigation in T-ALL.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Alleles", "Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Clonal Evolution", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Heterografts", "Humans", "In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence", "Infant", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Mutation", "Oncogene Proteins, Fusion", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "PTEN Phosphohydrolase", "Single-Cell Analysis", "T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044208474", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"36769068100": {"Name": "Furness C.L.", "AuthorID": "36769068100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "35488277800": {"Name": "Mansur M.B.", "AuthorID": "35488277800", "AffiliationID": "60014878", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de C\u00e2ncer"}, "6602700541": {"Name": "Ermini L.", "AuthorID": "6602700541", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "6603402662": {"Name": "Titley I.", "AuthorID": "6603402662", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7202318605": {"Name": "Ford A.M.", "AuthorID": "7202318605", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "55327352100": {"Name": "Potter N.E.", "AuthorID": "55327352100", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "35398813200": {"Name": "Greaves M.", "AuthorID": "35398813200", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "6701422568": {"Name": "Pombo-de-Oliveira M.S.", "AuthorID": "6701422568", "AffiliationID": "60014878", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Haematology-Oncology Program, Research Centre, Instituto Nacional de C\u00e2ncer"}, "7004371627": {"Name": "Weston V.J.", "AuthorID": "7004371627", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7005775979": {"Name": "Kearns P.", "AuthorID": "7005775979", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7003706399": {"Name": "van Delft F.W.", "AuthorID": "7003706399", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University"}, "35458793700": {"Name": "Harrison C.J.", "AuthorID": "35458793700", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University"}, "34971255600": {"Name": "Jenkinson S.", "AuthorID": "34971255600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7202817451": {"Name": "Gale R.", "AuthorID": "7202817451", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55936711600": {"Name": "Sanchez-Martin M.", "AuthorID": "55936711600", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University"}, "7004532329": {"Name": "Ferrando A.A.", "AuthorID": "7004532329", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University"}}}
