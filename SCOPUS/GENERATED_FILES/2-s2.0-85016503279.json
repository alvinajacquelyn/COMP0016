Method and Materials: Twenty healthy volunteers wore a specific appliance. After 2 days half of the samples were removed from the appliance. Posteriorly, after bacterial vital staining, samples were analyzed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In the first volunteer, one of the disks was analyzed using a scanning electronic microscope. The same process was realized on the remaining disks after 4 days. Results: The thicknesses of the PL-biofilm after 2 and 4 days were not significantly different. The bacterial vitality changed significantly from 72.50 \u00b1 15.50% to 57.54 \u00b1 15.66% over time, which was in contrast to the covering grade (53.08 \u00b1 18.03% and 70.74 \u00b1 19.11%). The structure changed from an irregular surface and compact deepest layer with a high predominance of the coccus shape to a complex structure with voids in the deepest layer and a great proportion of bacillus-shaped bacteria. Conclusion: The PL-biofilm thickness remained practically constant, decreasing the bacterial vitality and increasing the covering grade over time. Regarding the structure, differences were principally bacterial disposition in the surface and bacterial shape. Clinically, the findings show that new control strategies for combating the oral biofilm should be focused on inhibiting bacterial adhesion to tooth surfaces, which would reduce biofilm formation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacterial vitality", "Covering grade", "Laser scanning confocal microscopy", "Plaque-like biofilm", "Scanning electron microscopy", "Structure", "Thickness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biofilms", "Cross-Over Studies", "Dental Plaque", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Male", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Middle Aged", "Occlusal Splints", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016503279", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"56028506500": {"Name": "Prada-L\u00f3pez I.", "AuthorID": "56028506500", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Oral Sciences Research Group, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "56024974200": {"Name": "Quintas V.", "AuthorID": "56024974200", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Oral Sciences Research Group, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research, Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "6603427315": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Quintanilla D.", "AuthorID": "6603427315", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, Oral Sciences Research Group, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "7005882178": {"Name": "Tom\u00e1s I.", "AuthorID": "7005882178", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Special Needs Patients; and Director of Oral Sciences Research Group, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Santiago de Compostela"}}}
