This article examines the challenges of media convergence in the newsroom of Valor Econ\u00f4mico, the main economic newspaper in Brazil. In particular, it explores how the introduction in 2013 of Valor Pro, a real time news service oriented to the financial market, changed newsmaking practices at Valor Econ\u00f4mico. The introduction of Valor Pro meant that journalists from the whole newsroom had to report news simultaneously for three platforms: the real time service, the online website and the printed paper. This shift not only intensified journalists\u2019 workloads and altered the manufacture of news, but also increased financial pressure on the paper\u2019s agenda. I argue that this shift \u2013 from producing news for the public towards producing news for the market \u2013 cannot be explained solely with reference to traditional political economic factors such as ideological decisions at editorial level and the structural properties of the Brazilian media sphere. Instead, drawing on resources from cultural sociology and from science and technology studies, I provide a richer explanation that acknowledges the impact of technological innovation, the shifting nature of news values, and the agency of journalists themselves. This article elaborates on seven months of ethnographic fieldwork in Valor Econ\u00f4mico\u2019s newsroom in S\u00e3o Paulo between 2013 and 2015 and contributes to the literature on cultural sociology, media studies and science and technology studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brazil", "Brazilian", "business", "cultural production", "economy", "finance", "financial", "journalism", "media", "media convergence", "news", "newsroom", "technology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012982069", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56913389700": {"Name": "Undurraga T.", "AuthorID": "56913389700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
