Design and Methods: Between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013, 1413 TB/HIV patients (62 clinics in 19 countries in EE, WE, Southern Europe (SE), and LA) were enrolled. Results: Significant differences were observed between EE (N = 844), WE (N = 152), SE (N = 164), and LA (N = 253) in the proportion of patients with a definite TB diagnosis (47%, 71%, 72% and 40%, p<0.0001), MDR-TB (40%, 5%, 3% and 15%, p<0.0001), and use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (17%, 40%, 44% and 35%, p<0.0001). Injecting drug use (adjusted OR (aOR) = 2.03 (95% CI 1.00-4.09), prior anti-TB treatment (3.42 (1.88-6.22)), and living in EE (7.19 (3.28-15.78)) were associated with MDR-TB. Among 585 patients with drug susceptibility test (DST) results, the empiric (i.e. without knowledge of the DST results) anti-TB treatment included \u22653 active drugs in 66% of participants in EE compared with 90-96% in other regions (p<0.0001). Conclusions: In EE, TB/HIV patients were less likely to receive a definite TB diagnosis, more likely to house MDR-TB and commonly received empiric anti-TB treatment with reduced activity. Improved management of TB/HIV patients in EE requires better access to TB diagnostics including DSTs, empiric anti-TB therapy directed at both susceptible and MDR-TB, and more widespread use of cART.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antitubercular Agents", "Coinfection", "Europe", "Europe, Eastern", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Latin America", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957089772", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56083273900": {"Name": "Efsen A.M.W.", "AuthorID": "56083273900", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health and Infectious Disease Research (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, CHIP, Finsencentret, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "14322170800": {"Name": "Podlekareva D.N.", "AuthorID": "14322170800", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health and Infectious Disease Research (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, CHIP, Finsencentret, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health and Infectious Disease Research (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, CHIP, Finsencentret, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7005723136": {"Name": "Kirk O.", "AuthorID": "7005723136", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health and Infectious Disease Research (CHIP), Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, CHIP, Finsencentret, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "56601225300": {"Name": "Schultze A.", "AuthorID": "56601225300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Medical School"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Medical School"}, "7005967261": {"Name": "Post F.A.", "AuthorID": "7005967261", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health, Caldecot Centre, King's College Hospital"}, "7004024274": {"Name": "Panteleev A.", "AuthorID": "7004024274", "AffiliationID": "113335763", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV/TB"}, "35225781600": {"Name": "Furrer H.", "AuthorID": "35225781600", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern"}, "55547118657": {"Name": "Miller R.F.", "AuthorID": "55547118657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Mortimer Market Centre, University College London"}, "56785746500": {"Name": "Losso M.H.", "AuthorID": "56785746500", "AffiliationID": "60001846", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunocompromised, Hospital J.M.
