Aquatic organisms, including diatoms, macrophytes, invertebrates, and fish, can produce sufficiently robust remains that preserve well as fossils and can be identified in lake sediment records. Stable isotope analyses of these remains can then provide valuable insights into habitat-specific biogeochemistry, feeding ecology, but also on climatic and hydrological changes in and around lakes. Since these analyses focus on the remains of known and identified organisms, they can provide more specific and detailed information on past ecosystem, food web and environmental changes affecting different compartments of lake ecosystems than analyses on bulk sedimentary organic matter or carbonate samples. We review applications of these types of analyses in palaeoclimatology, palaeohydrology, and palaeoecology. Interpretation of the environmental \u2018signal\u2019 provided by taxon-specific stable isotope analysis requires a thorough understanding of the ecology and phenology of the organism groups involved. Growth, metabolism, diet, feeding strategy, migration, taphonomy and several other processes can lead to isotope fractionation or otherwise influence the stable isotope signatures of the remains from aquatic organisms. This paper includes a review of the (modern) calibration, culturing and modelling studies used to quantify the extent to which these factors influence stable isotope values and provides an outlook for future research and methodological developments for the different examined fossil groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diatoms", "Inorganic remains", "Invertebrates", "Lake sediment", "Organic remains", "Ostracods", "Stable isotopes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diatoms", "Inorganic remains", "Invertebrates", "Lake sediments", "Organic remains", "Ostracods", "Stable isotopes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051107804", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"26428586300": {"Name": "van Hardenbroek M.", "AuthorID": "26428586300", "AffiliationID": "60162625, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Politics and Sociology, Newcastle University"}, "14522518400": {"Name": "Henderson A.C.G.", "AuthorID": "14522518400", "AffiliationID": "60162625, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Politics and Sociology, Newcastle University"}, "56428461900": {"Name": "Chakraborty A.", "AuthorID": "56428461900", "AffiliationID": "60024681", "AffiliationName": "Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences"}, "57189264366": {"Name": "Davies K.L.", "AuthorID": "57189264366", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Plymouth University"}, "56542838800": {"Name": "Harding P.", "AuthorID": "56542838800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7403240604": {"Name": "Holmes J.A.", "AuthorID": "7403240604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57202208762": {"Name": "Roberts L.", "AuthorID": "57202208762", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "6602483096": {"Name": "Heiri O.", "AuthorID": "6602483096", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Geoecology, Department of Environmental Sciences, University of Basel"}, "55551779600": {"Name": "Lasher G.E.", "AuthorID": "55551779600", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Northwestern University"}, "7006497331": {"Name": "Leng M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006497331", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Geochemistry, School of Biosciences, Sutton Bonington Campus, University of Nottingham"}, "22986519600": {"Name": "Panizzo V.N.", "AuthorID": "22986519600", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Geochemistry, School of Geography, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "55433710100": {"Name": "Schilder J.", "AuthorID": "55433710100", "AffiliationID": "60032398", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Environmental Science, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4"}, "7006097948": {"Name": "Trueman C.N.", "AuthorID": "7006097948", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton Waterfront Campus"}, "6602526865": {"Name": "Wooller M.J.", "AuthorID": "6602526865", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Alaska Stable Isotope Facility, Water and Environmental Research Center, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}}}
