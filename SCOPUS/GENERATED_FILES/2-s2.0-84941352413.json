All NI prescriptions issued during the influenza seasons between October 2010 and May 2013 were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a large UK primary-care database. We calculated NI prescribing rates per 100 000 person-weeks (pw) by age group, sex, deprivation level, influenza season and presence of chronic conditions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and used negative binomial regression models to determine the independent association between these variables and NI prescribing. NI prescribing was rare. The prescribing rate was 1\u00b77/100 000 pw (95% CI 1\u00b77-1\u00b78) during influenza-active periods, and 0\u00b71/100 000 (95% CI 0\u00b71-0\u00b71) during non-active periods. Prescribing rates were highest in 25- to 44-year-olds in 2010/2011 and in persons aged 85 years in 2011/2012 and 2012/2013. Individuals with chronic conditions had significantly higher prescribing rates than persons without (rate ratio 2\u00b762, 95% CI 2\u00b727-3\u00b703). GPs are more likely to prescribe NIs to high-risk individuals and during influenza active periods, as per national guidelines. We could not assess the proportion of patients with influenza-like illness who were prescribed an NI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial drugs", "Influenza"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antiviral Agents", "Binomial Distribution", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Drug Prescriptions", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Infant", "Influenza, Human", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuraminidase", "Primary Health Care", "Regression Analysis", "Seasons", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941352413", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"23099718100": {"Name": "Hardelid P.", "AuthorID": "23099718100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7401932225": {"Name": "Gilbert R.", "AuthorID": "7401932225", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University"}, "6602151058": {"Name": "Rait G.", "AuthorID": "6602151058", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "PRIMENT Clinical Trials Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
