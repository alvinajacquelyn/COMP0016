However, the role of non-invasive ventilation with bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) in these patients is not well established. Methods: A prospective observational study of bCPAP was undertaken between July and September 2012 in 77 Malawian children aged 1 week to 14 years with progressive acute respiratory failure despite oxygen and antimicrobial therapy. Results: Forty-one (53%) patients survived following bCPAP treatment, and an HIV-uninfected single-organ disease subgroup demonstrated bCPAP success in 14 of 17 (82%). Compared with children aged \u226560 months, infants of 0\u20132 months had a 93% lower odds of bCPAP failure (odds ratio 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.004\u20131.02, P = 0.05). Following commencement of bCPAP, respiratory physiology improved, the average respiratory rate decreased from 61 to 49 breaths/minute (P = 0.0006), and mean oxygen saturation increased from 92.1% to 96.1% (P = 0.02). Conclusions: bCPAP was well accepted by caregivers and patients and can be feasibly implemented into a tertiary African hospital with high-risk patients and limited resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bubble continuous airway pressure (bCPAP)", "HIV", "Pneumonia", "Respiratory disorders", "Respiratory failure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009813227", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57205606914": {"Name": "Walk J.", "AuthorID": "57205606914", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "57188881180": {"Name": "Dinga P.", "AuthorID": "57188881180", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "57196151009": {"Name": "Banda C.", "AuthorID": "57196151009", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "57193270715": {"Name": "Msiska T.", "AuthorID": "57193270715", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "57192978258": {"Name": "Chitsamba E.", "AuthorID": "57192978258", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "57192985987": {"Name": "Chiwayula N.", "AuthorID": "57192985987", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "57192984550": {"Name": "Mlotha-Mitole R.", "AuthorID": "57192984550", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "55403196400": {"Name": "Phiri A.", "AuthorID": "55403196400", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "35756146700": {"Name": "McCollum E.D.", "AuthorID": "35756146700", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pulmonology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}, "56729907100": {"Name": "Lang H.J.", "AuthorID": "56729907100", "AffiliationID": "60072667", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Kamuzu Central Hospital"}, "16745020600": {"Name": "Lufesi N.", "AuthorID": "16745020600", "AffiliationID": "60072668", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health, Community Health Sciences Unit"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute for Global Health"}, "16021435300": {"Name": "Colbourn T.", "AuthorID": "16021435300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute for Global Health"}}}
