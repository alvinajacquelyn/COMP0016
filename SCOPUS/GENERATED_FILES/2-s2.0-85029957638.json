The underlying motivation of this work is that remodeling of collagen fibers gives rise to observable patterns in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from clinical cases of invasive breast carcinoma that the pathologist can label as mature or immature stroma. The aim of this paper is to categorise and automatically classify stromal regions according to their maturity and show that this classification agrees with that of skilled observers, hence providing a repeatable and quantitative measure for prognostic studies. Methods: We use multiscale basic image features and local binary patterns, in combination with a random decision trees classifier for classification of breast cancer stroma regions-of-interest (ROI). Results: We present results from a cohort of 55 patients with analysis of 169 ROI. Our multiscale approach achieved a classification accuracy of 84%. Conclusion: This work demonstrates the ability of texture-based image analysis to differentiate breast cancer stroma maturity in clinically acquired H&E-stained slides at least as well as skilled observers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "histopathology", "image classification", "stroma maturity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automated classification", "Breast Cancer", "Classification accuracy", "histopathology", "Local binary patterns", "Multi-scale approaches", "stroma maturity", "Tumor microenvironment", "Algorithms", "Biopsy", "Breast Neoplasms", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Microscopy", "Neoplasm Grading", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Stromal Cells", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029957638", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56694014000": {"Name": "Reis S.", "AuthorID": "56694014000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602192523": {"Name": "Hipwell J.", "AuthorID": "6602192523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36172530200": {"Name": "Mertzanidou T.", "AuthorID": "36172530200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55376574900": {"Name": "Gazinska P.", "AuthorID": "55376574900", "AffiliationID": "119209378", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Now Unit, Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies"}, "7005904555": {"Name": "Pinder S.", "AuthorID": "7005904555", "AffiliationID": "119209378", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Now Unit, Research Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies"}, "55261312700": {"Name": "Naidoo K.", "AuthorID": "55261312700", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7402771456": {"Name": "Williams N.", "AuthorID": "7402771456", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical and Interventional Trials Unit, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
