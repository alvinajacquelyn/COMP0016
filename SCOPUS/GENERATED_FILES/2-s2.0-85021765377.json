Infrared (IR) vibrational spectroscopy/microspectroscopy is an established analytical method that was first used in biomedical research over 20 years ago. With the advances in instrumentation, computational and mathematical techniques, this technology has now been applied to a variety of diseases; however, applications in nephrology are just beginning to emerge. In the present study, we used attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy to analyze urine samples collected from rodent models of inflammatory glomerulonephritis (GN) as well as from patients with crescentic GN, with the aim of identifying potential renal biomarkers; several characteristic mid-IR spectral markers were identified in urine samples. Specifically, a 1545 cm-1 band increased in intensity with the progression and severity of GN in rats, mice and humans. Furthermore, its intensity declined significantly in response to corticosteroid treatment in nephritic rats. In conclusion, our results suggest that specific urinary FTIR biomarkers may provide a rapid, sensitive and novel non-invasive means of diagnosing inflammatory forms of GN, and for real-Time monitoring of progress, and response to treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Animals", "Biomarkers", "Disease Models, Animal", "Early Diagnosis", "Female", "Glomerulonephritis", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Rats", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021765377", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57206464997": {"Name": "Yu M.C.", "AuthorID": "57206464997", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Kidney and Transplant Centre, Renal and Vascular Inflammation Section, Department of Medicine"}, "57221186285": {"Name": "Smith J.", "AuthorID": "57221186285", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Kidney and Transplant Centre, Renal and Vascular Inflammation Section, Department of Medicine"}, "56441326600": {"Name": "Tanna A.", "AuthorID": "56441326600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Kidney and Transplant Centre, Renal and Vascular Inflammation Section, Department of Medicine"}, "57194703098": {"Name": "Dibbur V.", "AuthorID": "57194703098", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Kidney and Transplant Centre, Renal and Vascular Inflammation Section, Department of Medicine"}, "7004921626": {"Name": "Tam F.W.K.", "AuthorID": "7004921626", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Kidney and Transplant Centre, Renal and Vascular Inflammation Section, Department of Medicine"}, "7102577604": {"Name": "Rich P.", "AuthorID": "7102577604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Life Science, University College London"}, "56607002500": {"Name": "Foreman L.", "AuthorID": "56607002500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Life Science, University College London"}, "7404272810": {"Name": "Yu M.S.", "AuthorID": "7404272810", "AffiliationID": "60016433", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, Tzu-Chi University"}, "8234615900": {"Name": "Unwin R.", "AuthorID": "8234615900", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Center for Nephrology, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus and Hospital"}}}
