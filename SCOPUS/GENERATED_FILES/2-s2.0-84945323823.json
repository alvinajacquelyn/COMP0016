To explore this uncertain ground, we interviewed 25 family members to consider how human absence is acted upon and not just felt within this space \u2018in between\u2019 grief and loss (Wayland, 2007). In the paper, we represent families as active agents in spatial stories of \u2018living in limbo\u2019, and we provide insights into the diverse strategies of search/ing (technical, physical and emotional) in which they engage to locate either their missing member or news of them. Responses to absence are shown to be intimately bound up with unstable spatial knowledges of the missing person and emotional actions that are subject to change over time. We suggest that practices of search are not just locative actions, but act as transformative processes providing insights into how families inhabit emotional dynamism and transition in response to the on-going \u2018missing situation\u2019 and ambiguous loss (Boss, 1999, 2013).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Absence", "Ambiguous loss", "Families", "Missing people", "Search"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945323823", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"]], "AuthorData": {"6603906892": {"Name": "Parr H.", "AuthorID": "6603906892", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Geographical and Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "36785569300": {"Name": "Stevenson O.", "AuthorID": "36785569300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "IRIS, University College London"}, "56020579200": {"Name": "Woolnough P.", "AuthorID": "56020579200", "AffiliationID": "60001903", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology, School of Social and Health Sciences, University of Abertay"}}}
