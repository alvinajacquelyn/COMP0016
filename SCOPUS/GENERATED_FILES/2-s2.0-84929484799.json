If so, then the classical speech areas in the caudalmost portion of the temporal gyrus (pSTG) and in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) may be critical for performing this acoustic-romotor transposition. We tested this proposal by applying repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to each of these left-hemisphere loci, as well as to a nonspeech locus, while participants listened to pseudowords. After 5 minutes these stimuli were re-presented together with new ones in a recognition test. Compared to control-site stimulation, pSTG stimulation produced a highly significant increase in recognition error rate, without affecting reaction time. By contrast, IFG stimulation led only to a weak, non-significant, trend toward recognition memory impairment. Importantly, the impairment after pSTG stimulation was not due to interference with perception, since the same stimulation failed to affect pseudoword discrimination examined with short interstimulus intervals. Our findings suggest that pSTG is essential for transforming speech sounds into stored motor plans for reproducing the sound. Whether or not the IFG also plays a role in speech-sound recognition could not be determined from the present results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Auditory Perception", "Diffusion", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory, Long-Term", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Speech", "Temporal Lobe", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929484799", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24169033900": {"Name": "Karabanov A.", "AuthorID": "24169033900", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"}, "7403293433": {"Name": "Scott B.", "AuthorID": "7403293433", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Mental Health"}, "7007041182": {"Name": "Mishkin M.", "AuthorID": "7007041182", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Mental Health"}, "15721272900": {"Name": "Paine R.", "AuthorID": "15721272900", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"}, "14029764800": {"Name": "Chao C.", "AuthorID": "14029764800", "AffiliationID": "60073385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, National Taiwan University Hospital"}, "55552602400": {"Name": "Hallett M.", "AuthorID": "55552602400", "AffiliationID": "60013780", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke"}, "15737764000": {"Name": "Schulze K.", "AuthorID": "15737764000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
