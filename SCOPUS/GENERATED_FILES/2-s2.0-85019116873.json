The high local multiplicity that characterizes cell\u2013cell infection causes variability in the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs applied as single agents. Whereas protease inhibitors (PIs) are effective inhibitors of HIV-1 cell\u2013cell and cell-free infection, some reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) show reduced potency; however, antiretrovirals are not administered as single agents and are used clinically as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Here we explored the efficacy of PI- and RTI-based cART against cell\u2013cell spread of wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1 strains. Using a quantitative assay to measure cell\u2013cell spread of HIV-1 between T cells, we evaluated the efficacy of different clinically relevant drug combinations. We show that combining PIs and RTIs improves the potency of inhibition of HIV-1 and effectively blocks both cell-free and cell\u2013cell spread. Combining drugs that alone are poor inhibitors of cell\u2013cell spread markedly improves HIV-1 inhibition, demonstrating that clinically relevant combinations of ART can inhibit this mode of HIV-1 spread. Furthermore, comparison of wild-type and drug-resistant viruses reveals that PI- and RTI-resistant viruses have a replicative advantage over wild-type virus when spreading by cell\u2013cell means in the presence of cART, suggesting that in the context of inadequate drug combinations or drug resistance, cell\u2013cell spread could potentially allow for ongoing viral replication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CART", "Cell\u2013cell", "Drug resistance", "HIV", "T cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Cell Line", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors", "T-Lymphocytes", "Virus Cultivation", "Virus Internalization", "Virus Release"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019116873", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"36490582600": {"Name": "Titanji B.K.", "AuthorID": "36490582600", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Africa Centre for Health and Population Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "8730584600": {"Name": "Jolly C.", "AuthorID": "8730584600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
