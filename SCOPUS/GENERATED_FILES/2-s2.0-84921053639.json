A facile one-step functionalization of biodegradable P DLLA fibers using amphiphilic diblock copolymers is demonstrated here to systematically vary the fiber surface composition. The copolymers comprise a hydrophilic poly-[oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate] (POEGMA), poly[(2-methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine] (PMPC), or poly-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)] (PDMAEMA) block and a hydrophobic poly(L-lactide) (PLA) block. The block copolymer-modified fi bers have increased surface hydrophilicity compared to that of PDLLA fibers. Mixtures of PLA-PMPC and PLA-POEGMA copolymers are utilized to exploit microphase separation of the incompatible hydrophilic PMPC and POEGMA blocks at the fiber surface. Conjugation of an RGD cell-adhesive peptide to one hydrophilic block (POEGMA) using thiol-ene chemistry produces fibers with domains of celladhesive (POEGMA) and cell-inert (PMPC) sites, mimicking the adhesive properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Human mesenchymal progenitor cells (hES-MPs) showed much better adhesion to the fibers with surface-adhesive heterogeneity compared to that to fibers with only adhesive or only inert surface chemistries.
