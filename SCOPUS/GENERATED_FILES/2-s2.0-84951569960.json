Interdisciplinary approaches, combining quantitative physical modeling with cell biology, are of growing interest to journal editors, funding agencies, and hiring committees. However, despite an ever-increasing emphasis on the importance of interdisciplinary research, the student trained in biology may still be at a loss as to what it actually means. I discuss here some considerations on how to achieve meaningful and high-quality interdisciplinary work.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Biology", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Physics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951569960", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"11240220400": {"Name": "Paluch E.", "AuthorID": "11240220400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London (UCL)"}}}
