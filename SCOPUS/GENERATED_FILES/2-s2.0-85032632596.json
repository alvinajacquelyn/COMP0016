Most current methods perform well on molecular function prediction, but struggle to provide useful annotations relating to biological process functions due to the limited power of sequence-based features in that functional domain. In this work, we systematically evaluate the predictive power of temporal transcription expression profiles for protein function prediction in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results show significantly better performance on predicting protein function when transcription expression profile-based features are integrated with sequence-derived features, compared with the sequence-derived features alone. We also observe that the combination of expression-based and sequence-based features leads to further improvement of accuracy on predicting all three domains of gene function. Based on the optimal feature combinations, we then propose a novel multi-classifier-based function prediction method for Drosophila melanogaster proteins, FFPred-fly+. Interpreting our machine learning models also allows us to identify some of the underlying links between biological processes and developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cluster Analysis", "Computational Biology", "Computer Simulation", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Models, Statistical", "Phenotype", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032632596", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"56047974200": {"Name": "Wan C.", "AuthorID": "56047974200", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Data Science Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "6505749958": {"Name": "Minneci F.", "AuthorID": "6505749958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203189821": {"Name": "Jones D.", "AuthorID": "57203189821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "9636068500": {"Name": "Lees J.", "AuthorID": "9636068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7006781333": {"Name": "Orengo C.", "AuthorID": "7006781333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
