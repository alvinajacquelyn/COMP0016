Here, we investigated several such mutations using a near-complete, hybrid 3D model of the human NMDAR and studied their consequences with kinetic modelling and electrophysiology. The mutants revealed reductions in glutamate potency; increased receptor desensitisation; and ablation of voltage-dependent Mg2+ block. In addition, we provide new views on Mg2+ and NMDA channel blocker binding sites. We demonstrate that these mutants have significant impact on excitatory transmission in developing neurons, revealing profound changes that could underlie their associated neurological disorders. Of note, the NMDAR channel mutant GluN2BV618G unusually allowed Mg2+ permeation, whereas nearby N615I reduced Ca2+ permeability. By identifying the binding site for an NMDAR antagonist that is used in the clinic to rescue gain-of-function phenotypes, we show that drug binding may be modified by some GluN2B disease-causing mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Computational Biology", "Disease", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Glutamates", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Ion Channels", "Ligands", "Magnesium", "Memantine", "Models, Molecular", "Mutation, Missense", "Neurons", "Protein Subunits", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043272193", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57201058709": {"Name": "Fedele L.", "AuthorID": "57201058709", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology UCL"}, "7103332648": {"Name": "Gibb A.", "AuthorID": "7103332648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology UCL"}, "7102576252": {"Name": "Smart T.G.", "AuthorID": "7102576252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology UCL"}, "57200832162": {"Name": "Newcombe J.", "AuthorID": "57200832162", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7006421825": {"Name": "Topf M.", "AuthorID": "7006421825", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57203196300": {"Name": "Harvey R.J.", "AuthorID": "57203196300", "AffiliationID": "60159369", "AffiliationName": "Sunshine Coast Health Institute Australia"}}}
