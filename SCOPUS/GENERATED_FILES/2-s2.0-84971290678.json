The majority of EA2 mutations reported so far are nonsense or deletion/insertion mutations predicted to form truncated proteins. Heterologous expression of wild-type CaV2.1, together with truncated constructs that mimic EA2 mutants, significantly suppressed wild-type calcium channel function, indicating that the truncated protein produces a dominant-negative effect (Jouvenceau et al., 2001; Page et al., 2004). A similar finding has been shown for CaV2.2 (Raghib et al., 2001). We show here that a highly conserved sequence in the cytoplasmic N-terminus is involved in this process, for both CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 channels. Additionally, we were able to interfere with the suppressive effect of an EA2 construct by mutating key N-terminal residues within it. We postulate that the N-terminus of the truncated channel plays an essential part in its interaction with the full-length CaV2.1, which prevents the correct folding of the wild-type channel. In agreement with this, we were able to disrupt the interaction between EA2 and the full length channel by co-expressing a free N-terminal peptide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dominant negative suppression", "Episodic ataxia-2", "Misfolded protein", "N-terminus", "P/Q-type calcium channel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Ataxia", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Cells, Cultured", "Membrane Potentials", "Mutation", "Nystagmus, Pathologic", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Rabbits", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971290678", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"8225538400": {"Name": "Dahimene S.", "AuthorID": "8225538400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "35952724400": {"Name": "Page K.", "AuthorID": "35952724400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "15124732500": {"Name": "Nieto-Rostro M.", "AuthorID": "15124732500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7201577660": {"Name": "Pratt W.", "AuthorID": "7201577660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "6602555122": {"Name": "D'Arco M.", "AuthorID": "6602555122", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "24498942300": {"Name": "Dolphin A.", "AuthorID": "24498942300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
