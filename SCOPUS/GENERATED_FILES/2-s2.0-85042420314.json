This study proposes a modified data envelopment analysis method combined with materials balance principle to estimate ecological and cost efficiency in the Chinese electricity industry. The economic cost and ecological impact of energy input reallocation strategies for improving efficiency are identified. The possible impacts of pollution taxes upon the levels of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emissions are assessed. Estimation results show that (1) both energy input costs and SO 2 could be reduced through increasing technical efficiency. (2) It is possible to adjust energy input mix to attain ecological efficiency, and, correspondingly, SO 2 would be reduced by 15%. (3) The Chinese electricity industry would reduce its unit cost by 9% if optimal ecological efficiency is attained and reduce its unit pollution by 13% if optimal cost efficiency is attained, implying that there are positive ecological synergy effects associated with energy cost savings and positive economic synergy effects associated with SO 2 pollution reductions. (4) Estimated shadow costs of SO 2 reduction are very high, suggesting that, in the short term, the Chinese electricity industry should pursue cost efficiency instead of ecological efficiency, since alternative abatement activities are less costly and some of the abatement cost could be further offset by energy input cost savings. (5) There would be no significant difference between the impacts of pollution discharge fees and pollution taxes on SO 2 emissions levels because of the relatively low pollution tax rate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["data envelopment analysis (DEA)", "economic and ecological trade-offs", "emission reduction", "environmental efficiency", "material balance", "sulfur dioxide (SO 2 )"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ecological and economic", "Ecological efficiency", "Emission reduction", "Environmental efficiency", "Environmental outcome", "Material balance", "Pollution discharges", "Trade off"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042420314", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56196425500": {"Name": "Wang K.", "AuthorID": "56196425500", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Electric Vehicles in Beijing"}, "13005705700": {"Name": "Wei Y.M.", "AuthorID": "13005705700", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Electric Vehicles in Beijing"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}}}
