Both players observe the performance of the employee and update their common posterior beliefs about the employee\u2019s capability. The learning process presents each party with an option: the firm can terminate an incapable employee, and a capable employee can leave the firm for greater financial remuneration elsewhere. To understand the impact of this noncooperative interaction, we examine the Markov perfect equilibrium termination strategies and payoffs that unfold. We find that in the region of sufficiently high learning rates, reducing the rate of learning can increase the equilibrium payoff for both parties. Slower learning prolongs the employment because more performance outcomes must be observed to fully assess the employee\u2019s capability. In the region of sufficiently slow learning rates, reducing the rate of learning can benefit the firm if the employee is deemed capable but hurt the firm otherwise. Our result identifies a nonfinancial way for firms to improve retention of capable new employees.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian sequential decision", "employee retention", "stochastic dynamic game", "timing game"], "IndexKeywords": ["Employee retention", "Markov perfect equilibrium", "Performance outcome", "Sequential decisions", "Stochastic dynamics", "Strategic interactions", "Termination strategy", "timing game"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041183097", "SubjectAreas": [["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"56286992300": {"Name": "Kwon H.D.", "AuthorID": "56286992300", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Business Administration, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "57191479798": {"Name": "Yoo O.S.", "AuthorID": "57191479798", "AffiliationID": "60176025, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management, University College London"}}}
