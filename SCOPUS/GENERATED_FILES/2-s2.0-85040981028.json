Although the second surgery that single ventricle patients undergo is thought to decrease AVVR, there is much controversy in the clinical literature about AVVR treatment. Methods: The effect of AVVR on Stage 1 haemodynamics and resulting acute changes from conversion to Stage 2 circulation in single ventricle patients are analyzed through lumped parameter models. Several degrees of AVVR severity are analyzed, for two types of valve regurgitation: incomplete leaflet closure and valve prolapse. Results: The models show that increasing AVVR in Stage 1 induces the following effects: first, higher stroke volume and associated decrease in ventricular end-systolic volume; second, increase in atrial volumes with V-loop enlargement in pressure-volume curves; third, pulmonary venous hypertension. The Stage 2 surgery results in volume unloading of the ventricle, thereby, driving a decrease in AVVR. However, this effect is offset by an increase in ventricular pressures resulting in a net increase in regurgitation fraction (RF) of approximately 0.1 (for example, in severe AVVR, the preoperative RF increases from -60% to 70% postoperatively). Moreover, despite some improvements to sarcomere function early after Stage 2 surgery, it may deteriorate in cases of severe AVVR. Conclusion: In patients with moderate to severe AVVR, restoration of atrioventricular valve competence prior to, or at the time of, Stage 2 surgery would likely lead to improved haemodynamics and clinical outcome as the models suggest that uncorrected AVVR can worsen across Stage 2 surgery. This was found to be independent of the AVVR degree and mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrioventricular valve", "cardiovascular flow", "hypoplastic left heart syndrome", "incomplete leaflet closure", "lumped parameter model", "prolapse", "valve regurgitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arteries", "Cardiovascular flow", "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome", "incomplete leaflet closure", "Lumped parameter modeling", "prolapse"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040981028", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56121134700": {"Name": "Pant S.", "AuthorID": "56121134700", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering Giulio Natta, Politecnico di Milano"}, "7004162794": {"Name": "Pennati G.", "AuthorID": "7004162794", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biological Structure Mechanics, Department of Chemistry, Materials and Chemical Engineering Giulio Natta, Politecnico di Milano"}, "54882677100": {"Name": "Corsini C.", "AuthorID": "54882677100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Unit, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57198875486": {"Name": "Baker C.", "AuthorID": "57198875486", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "54883432300": {"Name": "Hsia T.Y.", "AuthorID": "54883432300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "13004394100": {"Name": "Vignon-Clementel I.E.", "AuthorID": "13004394100", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60072945", "AffiliationName": "Inria Paris and Sorbonne Universites UPMC Paris 6, Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions"}}}
