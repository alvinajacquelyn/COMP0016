I have been influenced by his use of the notion of process to bring more clarity to understand quantum phenomena. In this paper, I want to summarise the latest ideas on the time development of quantum processes that relate the transformation theory of Dirac, Feynman and Schwinger to the notion of weak values which has triggered experimental investigations of the nature of a deeper underlying stochastic structure of quantum processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bohm trajectories", "Feynman paths", "Weak values"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066484004", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"6603149516": {"Name": "Hiley B.J.", "AuthorID": "6603149516", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, University College London"}}}
