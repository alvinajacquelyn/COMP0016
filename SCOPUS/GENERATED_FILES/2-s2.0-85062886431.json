It firstly develops the principal physical variables and evaluation criteria; then, test models are created using an orthogonal design experiment; finally, two evaluation methods are used to comprehensively test acceptance, based on a questionnaire and an eye-tracking study. The results show that: (1) The effects of the amount of wood coverage and the wood patterns are significant, whereas the effect of material combinations is insignificant. (2) The acceptance of building facades is at the highest level when the amount of wood coverage is 65%. (3) The amounts of wood coverage for facades in the range of 35% to 50% are effective when designing the facade of wood buildings, in order to implement the dual targets of saving wood and higher acceptance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acceptance", "Building facade", "Eye-tracking", "Sustainability", "Wood building", "Wood coverage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062886431", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"35338618200": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "35338618200", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Key Lab. of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Tech., Ministry of Industry and Information, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57204962807": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "57204962807", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Key Lab. of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Tech., Ministry of Industry and Information, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "56093722200": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "56093722200", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Key Lab. of Cold Region Urban and Rural Human Settlement Environment Science and Tech., Ministry of Industry and Information, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett, University College London (UCL)"}}}
