However, its application is restricted by system size, leaving a number of interesting systems without a high-accuracy quantum description. In this work, we calculate the electronic and structural properties of a graphene-metal system significantly larger than in previous plane-wave calculations with the same accuracy. For this task we use a localised basis set with the Conquest code, both in their primitive, pseudo-atomic orbital form, and using a recent multi-site approach. This multi-site scheme allows us to maintain accuracy while saving computational time and memory requirements, even in our exemplar complex system of graphene grown on Rh(1 1 1) with and without intercalated atomic oxygen. This system offers a rich scenario that will serve as a benchmark, demonstrating that highly accurate simulations in cells with over 3000 atoms are feasible with modest computational resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["density functional theory", "graphenemetal interface", "large-scale simulations", "localized orbitals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex electronic systems", "Computational resources", "Computational simulation", "Computational time and memory", "Electronic and structural properties", "Large scale simulations", "Localized orbitals", "Plane wave calculations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057085668", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55619521100": {"Name": "Romero-Mu\u00f1iz C.", "AuthorID": "55619521100", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "First-Principles Simulation Group, Nano-Theory Field, International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}, "13605791600": {"Name": "Pou P.", "AuthorID": "13605791600", "AffiliationID": "60106502, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC), Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "7402543836": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez R.", "AuthorID": "7402543836", "AffiliationID": "60106502, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC), Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "9632953700": {"Name": "Nakata A.", "AuthorID": "9632953700", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "First-Principles Simulation Group, Nano-Theory Field, International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}, "7006156424": {"Name": "Bowler D.R.", "AuthorID": "7006156424", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56052137500": {"Name": "Miyazaki T.", "AuthorID": "56052137500", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "First-Principles Simulation Group, Nano-Theory Field, International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}}}
