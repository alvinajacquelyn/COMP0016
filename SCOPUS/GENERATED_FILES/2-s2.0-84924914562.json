To address this problem, we propose estimation of only the channel parameters of the desired links in a target cell, but those of the interference links from adjacent cells. The required estimation is, nonetheless, an underdetermined system. In this paper, we show that if the propagation properties of massive MIMO systems can be exploited, it is possible to obtain an accurate estimate of the channel parameters. Our strategy is inspired by the observation that for a cellular network, the channel from user equipment to a base station is composed of only a few clustered paths in space. With a very large antenna array, signals can be observed under extremely sharp regions in space. As a result, if the signals are observed in the beam domain (using Fourier transform), the channel is approximately sparse, i.e., the channel matrix contains only a small fraction of large components, and other components are close to zero. This observation then enables channel estimation based on sparse Bayesian learning methods, where sparse channel components can be reconstructed using a small number of observations. Results illustrate that compared to conventional estimators, the proposed approach achieves much better performance in terms of the channel estimation accuracy and achievable rates in the presence of pilot contamination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian learning", "Channel estimation", "Gaussian mixture", "Massive MIMO", "Pilot contamination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate channel estimation", "Bayesian learning", "Gaussian mixtures", "Multiple-input-multiple-output antenna systems", "Pilot contaminations", "Propagation properties", "Sparse Bayesian learning", "Underdetermined systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924914562", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7201367144": {"Name": "Wen C.K.", "AuthorID": "7201367144", "AffiliationID": "60011357", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "24444199100": {"Name": "Chen J.C.", "AuthorID": "24444199100", "AffiliationID": "60033110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University"}, "8410390200": {"Name": "Ting P.", "AuthorID": "8410390200", "AffiliationID": "60022847", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Technology Research Institute"}}}
