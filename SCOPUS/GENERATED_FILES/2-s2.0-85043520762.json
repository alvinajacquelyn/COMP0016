Different kind of interactors can interfere with the formation of protein dimers and multimers in solution. A very special class of interactors are nanoparticles thanks to the extremely efficient extension of their interaction surface. In particular citrate-coated gold nanoparticles (cit-AuNPs) were recently investigated with amyloidogenic protein \u03b22-microglobulin (\u03b22m). Here we present the computational studies on two challenging models known for their enhanced amyloidogenic propensity, namely \u0394N6 and D76N \u03b22m naturally occurring variants, and disclose the role of cit-AuNPs on their fibrillogenesis. The proposed interaction mechanism lies in the interference of the cit-AuNPs with the protein dimers at the early stages of aggregation, that induces dimer disassembling. As a consequence, natural fibril formation can be inhibited. Relying on the comparison between atomistic simulations at multiple levels (enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and Brownian dynamics) and protein structural characterisation by NMR, we demonstrate that the cit-AuNPs interactors are able to inhibit protein dimer assembling. As a consequence, the natural fibril formation is also inhibited, as found in experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid fibril formation", "Amyloidogenic proteins", "Atomistic simulations", "Beta-2-microglobulin", "Computational studies", "Interaction mechanisms", "Protein aggregation", "Systemic amyloidosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043520762", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"8387416700": {"Name": "Brancolini G.", "AuthorID": "8387416700", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Center S3, CNR Institute Nanoscience"}, "57201133294": {"Name": "Maschio M.", "AuthorID": "57201133294", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Center S3, CNR Institute Nanoscience"}, "7202317328": {"Name": "Esposito G.", "AuthorID": "7202317328", "AffiliationID": "60104576", "AffiliationName": "Science and Math Division, New York University at Abu Dhabi"}, "56926809200": {"Name": "Cantarutti C.", "AuthorID": "56926809200", "AffiliationID": "60025965", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienza Mediche e Biologiche (DSMB), University of Udine"}, "6701582903": {"Name": "Corazza A.", "AuthorID": "6701582903", "AffiliationID": "60082163", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale Biostrutture e Biosistemi Viale Medaglie d'Oro"}, "56233125800": {"Name": "Fogolari F.", "AuthorID": "56233125800", "AffiliationID": "60082163", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale Biostrutture e Biosistemi Viale Medaglie d'Oro"}, "7006438238": {"Name": "Bellotti V.", "AuthorID": "7006438238", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College of London"}, "6601962180": {"Name": "Corni S.", "AuthorID": "6601962180", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Science, University of Padova"}}}
