In two studies over 4,000 adult British managers completed a battery of tests including a \u2018bright side\u2019 personality trait measure (HPI); a \u2018dark side\u2019/disorders measure (HDS), and a measure of their Motives and Values which included Altruism. The two studies showed similar results revealing that those who were low on Adjustment (Neuroticism) but high on Interpersonal Sensitivity (Agreeableness), Prudence (Conscientiousness) and Inquisitiveness (Openness) were more likely to value Altruism and be motivated to commit altruistic acts which concerns helping others and creating an environment that places emphasis on customer service. Those more interested in \u201cGetting Along\u201d with others were more Altruistic than those more interested in \u201cGetting Ahead\u201d of others. Implications for the selection and management of altruistic people in a business are considered. Limitations and future directions of this research are also noted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Altruism", "Personality disorders", "Personality traits"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908291787", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "BI Norwegian Business School"}, "56397159200": {"Name": "Treglown L.", "AuthorID": "56397159200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55071482100": {"Name": "Hyde G.", "AuthorID": "55071482100", "AffiliationID": "113649850", "AffiliationName": "PCL Tunbridge-Wells"}, "36761872100": {"Name": "Trickey G.", "AuthorID": "36761872100", "AffiliationID": "113649850", "AffiliationName": "PCL Tunbridge-Wells"}}}
