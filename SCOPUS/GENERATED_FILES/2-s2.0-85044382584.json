Walkability is a characteristic of the physical environment, and may be a potential facilitator to changing physical activity levels. Methods Using data collected during the Walking Away from Diabetes randomized controlled trial, we examined the association between the walkability of the home neighbourhood and physical activity of participants. We also determined whether home neighbourhood walkability of participants was associated with the intervention effect of the education programme. Results Data from 706 participants were available for analysis. Neighbourhood walkability was not significantly associated with any of the physical activity measures at baseline, or at 12, 24 or 36 months following the intervention (P > 0.05 for all). There was no association between walkability and change in purposeful steps/day from baseline to 36 months in the usual care or intervention arm; 25.77 (''99.04, 150.58) and 42.97 (''327.63, 413.45), respectively. Conclusion Neighbourhood walkability appeared to have no association with objectively measured physical activity in this population. Furthermore, the walkability of participant's neighbourhood did not influence the effectiveness of a lifestyle programme.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diabetes", "public health", "walking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Environment Design", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Risk Reduction Behavior", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044382584", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55413209200": {"Name": "Carter P.", "AuthorID": "55413209200", "AffiliationID": "60033125, 60015908", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Research Centre, University of Leicester, Leicester General Hospital"}, "56020570900": {"Name": "Bodicoat D.H.", "AuthorID": "56020570900", "AffiliationID": "118786483", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leicester-Loughborough, Diet, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit"}, "7005202765": {"Name": "Khunti K.", "AuthorID": "7005202765", "AffiliationID": "118786483", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leicester-Loughborough, Diet, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit"}, "35477152800": {"Name": "Davies M.J.", "AuthorID": "35477152800", "AffiliationID": "118786483", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leicester-Loughborough, Diet, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit"}, "31667536700": {"Name": "Edwardson C.L.", "AuthorID": "31667536700", "AffiliationID": "118786483", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leicester-Loughborough, Diet, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit"}, "35784360400": {"Name": "Henson J.", "AuthorID": "35784360400", "AffiliationID": "118786483", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leicester-Loughborough, Diet, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit"}, "16302307500": {"Name": "Yates T.", "AuthorID": "16302307500", "AffiliationID": "118786483", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leicester-Loughborough, Diet, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit"}, "7407101741": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "7407101741", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "57200949747": {"Name": "Coombes E.", "AuthorID": "57200949747", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}}}
