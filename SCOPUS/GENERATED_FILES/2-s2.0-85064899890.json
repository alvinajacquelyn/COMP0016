This provides increased impetuses for extensive maritime activities and attracts research interests in sea ice modelling. In the polar region, ice sheets can be several kilometres long and subjected to the effects of ocean waves. As its thickness to length ratio is very small, the wave response of such a large ice sheet, known as its hydroelastic response, is dominated by an elastic deformation rather than rigid body motions. In the past 25 years, sea ice hydroelasticity has been widely studied by theoretical models; however, recent experiments indicate that the ideal assumptions used for these theoretical models can cause considerable inaccuracies. This work proposes a numerical approach based on OpenFOAM to simulate the hydroelastic wave-ice interaction, with the Navier-Stokes equations describing the fluid domain, the St. Venant Kirchhoff solid model governing the ice deformation and a coupling scheme to achieve the fluid-structure interaction. Following validation against experiments, the proposed model has been shown capable of capturing phenomena that have not been included in current theoretical models. In particular, the developed model shows the capability to predict overwash, which is a ubiquitous polar phenomenon reported to be a key gap. The present model has the potential to be used to study wave-ice behaviours and the coupled wave-ice effect on marine structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fluid-structure interaction", "Hydroelasticity", "Ocean surface wave", "OpenFOAM", "Overwash", "Sea ice"], "IndexKeywords": ["Current theoretical models", "Hydroelastic response", "Maritime activities", "Numerical approaches", "Ocean surface waves", "OpenFOAM", "Overwash", "Validation against experiments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064899890", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"57205472132": {"Name": "Huang L.", "AuthorID": "57205472132", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57192237987": {"Name": "Ren K.", "AuthorID": "57192237987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57208500349": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57208500349", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanics and Maritime Science, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "6504665769": {"Name": "Tukovi\u0107 \u017d.", "AuthorID": "6504665769", "AffiliationID": "60087200, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Zagreb"}, "55164687500": {"Name": "Cardiff P.", "AuthorID": "55164687500", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, University College Dublin"}}}
