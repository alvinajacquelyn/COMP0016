Investigations under applied reaction conditions over such materials seem to be rare and a comprehensive understanding of the involved active copper oxide species could facilitate a knowledge-based catalyst optimization. In the present work, Cu-Mg-Al-Ox mixed metal oxides and Cu/Al2O3 active catalysts in NH3-SCO were investigated under NH3/O2/CO2/H2O/N2 reaction conditions. Powder XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR and XAFS methods were used to characterize Cu-Mg-Al-Ox (Cu/Mg/Al = 8/63/29, mol%) and 10 wt% Cu/Al2O3. Cu-Mg-Al-Ox hydrotalcite derived mixed metal oxides were obtained by coprecipitation, while Cu/Al2O3 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. A highly dispersed copper oxide species formed on Cu-Mg-Al-Ox, while a mixture of highly dispersed (CuOx) and bulk copper oxide species (CuO and CuAl2O4) formed on Cu/Al2O3. The comparison of Cu-Mg-Al-Ox and Cu/Al2O3 in NH3-SCO provided good insight into the nature of the active species present in both copper-based catalysts. It was found that highly dispersed easily reducible copper oxide species and bulk copper oxide species appear as active species under NH3/O2/N2 and NH3/O2/CO2/H2O/N2 reaction conditions, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alumina", "Copper", "Large-scale NH3-SCO", "Mixed metal oxides"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalyst optimization", "Copper oxide species", "Copper-based catalysts", "Incipientwetness impregnation", "Large-scale NH3-SCO", "Mixed metal oxide", "Reaction conditions", "Selective catalytic oxidation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043395906", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"57211565320": {"Name": "Jab\u0142o\u0144ska M.", "AuthorID": "57211565320", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Center for Automotive Catalytic Systems Aachen, RWTH Aachen University"}, "24503622700": {"Name": "Palkovits R.", "AuthorID": "24503622700", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Center for Automotive Catalytic Systems Aachen, RWTH Aachen University"}, "57201085845": {"Name": "Wolkenar B.", "AuthorID": "57201085845", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Combustion Engines VKA, RWTH Aachen University"}, "6701308285": {"Name": "Pischinger S.", "AuthorID": "6701308285", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Combustion Engines VKA, RWTH Aachen University"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
