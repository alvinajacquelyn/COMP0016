All rights reserved.This chapter outlines these three perspectives on human functional brain development before assessing their application and different implications for understanding empirical evidence from: functional brain imaging, the effects of early acquired brain damage, and the consequences of atypical early experience. Relating evidence on the neuroanatomical development of the brain to the remarkable changes in motor, perceptual, and cognitive abilities during the 1st decade or so of human life presents a considerable challenge. The chapter describes three approaches to this issue: a maturational viewpoint, interactive specialization, and a skill-learning viewpoint. Both the skill-learning and interactive specialization (IS) viewpoints share the assumption of dynamic mapping, which is supported by the evidence reviewed in the chapter. Three cognitive domains discussed in the chapter include: face processing, memory, and language. The chapter highlights that the three perspectives on human functional brain development differ in their views as to the effects of early atypical experience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Development of face processing", "Early acquired brain damage", "Human functional brain development", "Interactive specialization approach", "Language learning", "Semantic memory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986538863", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"36072829800": {"Name": "Johnson M.H.", "AuthorID": "36072829800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7004346948": {"Name": "De Haan M.", "AuthorID": "7004346948", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "University of London"}}}
