We aimed to assess this association in Peruvian women using data from a nationally representative survey.METHODS: We used data from Peru's Demographic and Health Survey, 2012. Parity was defined as the number of children ever born to a woman. We defined overweight as having a body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) of 25.0 to 29.9 and obesity as a BMI \u226530.0. Generalized linear models were used to evaluate the association between parity and BMI and BMI categories, by area of residence and age, adjusting for confounders.RESULTS: Data from 16,082 women were analyzed. Mean parity was 2.25 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.17-2.33) among rural women and 1.40 (95% CI, 1.36-1.43) among urban women. Mean BMI was 26.0 (standard deviation, 4.6). We found evidence of an association between parity and BMI, particularly in younger women; BMI was up to 4 units higher in rural areas and 2 units higher in urban areas. An association between parity and BMI categories was observed in rural areas as a gradient, being highest in younger women.CONCLUSION: We found a positive association between parity and overweight/obesity. This relationship was stronger in rural areas and among younger mothers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Distribution", "Body Mass Index", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Developing Countries", "Female", "Geographic Mapping", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Parity", "Peru", "Population Surveillance", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049236648", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56674792400": {"Name": "Huayanay-Espinoza C.A.", "AuthorID": "56674792400", "AffiliationID": "60111424, 60071237", "AffiliationName": null}, "55599089700": {"Name": "Quispe R.", "AuthorID": "55599089700", "AffiliationID": "60111424, 60071237", "AffiliationName": null}, "51864575300": {"Name": "Poterico J.A.", "AuthorID": "51864575300", "AffiliationID": "60111424, 60071237", "AffiliationName": null}, "55193608000": {"Name": "Carrillo-Larco R.M.", "AuthorID": "55193608000", "AffiliationID": "60111424, 60071237", "AffiliationName": null}, "57188860648": {"Name": "Bazo-Alvarez J.C.", "AuthorID": "57188860648", "AffiliationID": "60111424, 60071237", "AffiliationName": null}, "24465295500": {"Name": "Miranda J.J.", "AuthorID": "24465295500", "AffiliationID": "60071237", "AffiliationName": null}}}
