Setting Three London (UK) hospitals (coronary care units and medical wards). Participants Patients were recruited with diabetes mellitus (DM) (types 1 and 2) with a clinical presentation of MI (ST elevated MI (STEMI), non-ST elevated MI (NSTEMI), acute MI unspecified and cardiac arrest). A total of 43 participants were recruited, and 39 interviews met the study criteria and were analysed. They were predominantly male (n=30), aged 40-90 years and white British (18/39), and just over a half were from other ethnic groups. The majority had type 2 DM (n=35), 24 had an NSTEMI, 10 had an STEMI and five had other cardiac events. Definitions of selection/exclusion criteria A diagnosis of MI and DM and the ability to communicate enough English to complete the interview. Ward staff made a clinical judgement that the participant was post-treatment, clinically stable and well enough to participate. Methods A qualitative study using taped and transcribed interviews analysed using a thematic analysis. Results While most participants did experience chest pain, it was often not their most striking symptom. As their chest pain did not match their expectations of what a 'heart attack' should be, participants developed narratives to explain these symptoms, including the symptoms being effects of their DM ('hypos'), side effects of medication (oral hypoglycaemics) or symptoms (such as breathlessness and indigestion) related to other comorbidities, often leading to delays in seeking care. Conclusions While truly absent chest pain during MI among people with DM was rare in this study, patients' attenuated symptoms often led to delay in seeking attention, and this may result in delays in receiving treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chest pain", "myocardial infarction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Chest Pain", "Comorbidity", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Qualitative Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034767839", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57197786711": {"Name": "Berman N.", "AuthorID": "57197786711", "AffiliationID": "60005671", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Psychiatry, Swn-y-Gwynt Day Hospital, Plymouth Hospitals, NHS Trust"}, "35724190300": {"Name": "Jones M.M.", "AuthorID": "35724190300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "56133973900": {"Name": "De Coster D.A.", "AuthorID": "56133973900", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Core Medical Trainee, Princess Royal University Hospital Bromley, King's College NHS Trust"}}}
