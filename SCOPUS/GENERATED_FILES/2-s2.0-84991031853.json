Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This paper takes a typological exploration of the \u2018tools\u2019 of \u2018design governance\u2019. It begins by exploring the generic literature that focuses on the range of instruments, approaches and actions \u2012 the tools \u2012 that policy makers deploy in order to steer public and private actors towards particular policy outcomes. Subsequently, how the notion of tools relates to practices of design governance is examined: first, encompassing three \u2018formal\u2019 categories of design governance tools \u2012 guidance, incentive and control \u2012 and second, by drawing on the work of the former Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) in England to introduce five categories of \u2018informal\u2019 design governance tools \u2012 evidence, knowledge, promotion, evaluation and assistance. The result, and the key contribution of this paper, is a new and comprehensive (albeit evolving), design governance toolbox that extends from formal to informal tools and far beyond that which most policy makers recognize or use.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991031853", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"7102234035": {"Name": "Carmona M.", "AuthorID": "7102234035", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning, UCL"}}}
