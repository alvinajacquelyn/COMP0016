A setup suitable for in situ measurements in transmission mode at the cerium K edge from room temperature up to 1773 K is presented. Time-resolved X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) data, collected for a 10 mol% hafnium-doped ceria sample (Ce0.9Hf0.1O2-\u03b4) during reduction at 1773 K in a flow of inert gas and during re-oxidation by CO2 at 1073 K, enables the quantitative determination of the non-stoichiometry \u03b4 of the fluorite-type structure. XANES analysis suggests the formation of the hexagonal Ce2O3 phase upon reduction in 2% hydrogen/helium at 1773 K. We discuss the experimental limitations and possibilities of high-temperature in situ XAS at edges of lower energy as well as the importance of the technique for understanding and improving the properties of ceria-based oxygen storage materials for thermochemical solar energy conversion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943760098", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56898952500": {"Name": "Rothensteiner M.", "AuthorID": "56898952500", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57191371234": {"Name": "Sala S.", "AuthorID": "57191371234", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Paul Scherrer Institut"}, "7004087000": {"Name": "Van Bokhoven J.A.", "AuthorID": "7004087000", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "56165833700": {"Name": "Bonk A.", "AuthorID": "56165833700", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "EMPA"}, "35270699200": {"Name": "Vogt U.", "AuthorID": "35270699200", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "EMPA"}, "11839735700": {"Name": "Emerich H.", "AuthorID": "11839735700", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "ESRF 71"}}}
