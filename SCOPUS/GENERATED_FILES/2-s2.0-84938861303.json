Over the last two decades, however, there has been an increased focus on the development of antidepressants and antipsychotics on the part of the pharmaceutical industry, clinicians, and researchers, with a reduced interest in BDZs, in spite of their widespread clinical use. As a consequence, many psychiatric residents, medical students, nurses, and other mental health professionals might receive poor academic teaching and training regarding these agents, and have the false impression that BDZs represent an outdated chapter in clinical psychopharmacology. However, recent advances in the field, including findings concerning epidemiology, addiction risk, and drug interactions, as well as the introduction of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition with related diagnostic changes, strongly encourage an updated appraisal of the use of BDZs in clinical practice. During a recent thematic event convened with the aim of approaching this topic in a critical manner, a group of young Italian psychiatrists attempted to highlight possible flaws in current teaching pathways, identify the main clinical pros and cons regarding current use of BDZs in clinical practice, and provide an updated overview of their use across specific clinical areas and patient populations. The main results are presented and discussed in this review.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benzodiazepines", "Psychiatric clinical practice", "Risks and benefits", "Teaching issues"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938861303", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"13605549800": {"Name": "Dell\u2019Osso B.", "AuthorID": "13605549800", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Bipolar Disorders Clinic, Stanford Medical School, Stanford University"}, "7003970659": {"Name": "Albert U.", "AuthorID": "7003970659", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Rita Levi Montalcini Department of Neuroscience, University of Turin"}, "6603007457": {"Name": "Atti A.R.", "AuthorID": "6603007457", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical and NeuroMotor Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "23388353800": {"Name": "Carmassi C.", "AuthorID": "23388353800", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "55958949200": {"Name": "Cosci F.", "AuthorID": "55958949200", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Florence"}, "39561042900": {"Name": "Del Vecchio V.", "AuthorID": "39561042900", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "53984898200": {"Name": "Luciano M.", "AuthorID": "53984898200", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "54409538300": {"Name": "Sampogna G.", "AuthorID": "54409538300", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "55933795400": {"Name": "Volpe U.", "AuthorID": "55933795400", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "55141656400": {"Name": "Fiorillo A.", "AuthorID": "55141656400", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Naples SUN"}, "16177381600": {"Name": "Di Nicola M.", "AuthorID": "16177381600", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry Psychology, Catholic University of Sacred Heart"}, "35315499000": {"Name": "Ferrari S.", "AuthorID": "35315499000", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diagnostic-Clinical Medicine and Public Health, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "6602682925": {"Name": "Goracci A.", "AuthorID": "6602682925", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Medicine and Clinical, Department of Mental Health, University of Siena"}, "16042517300": {"Name": "Iasevoli F.", "AuthorID": "16042517300", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive Sciences, Odontostomatology University Federico II of Naples"}, "14060551000": {"Name": "Martinotti G.", "AuthorID": "14060551000", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Imaging, and Clinical Science, University G.d Annunzio"}, "35330577100": {"Name": "Nanni M.G.", "AuthorID": "35330577100", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychiatry, Department of Biomedical, Specialty Surgical Sciences University of Ferrara"}, "6503959361": {"Name": "Nivoli A.", "AuthorID": "6503959361", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60104561, 60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Bipolar Disorder Unit CIBERSAM, IDIBAPS Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona"}, "7005067399": {"Name": "Pinna F.", "AuthorID": "7005067399", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Clinical and Molecular Medicine, Unit of Psychiatry, University of Cagliari"}, "57201985802": {"Name": "Poloni N.", "AuthorID": "57201985802", "AffiliationID": "60005400", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Psychiatric Division, University of Insubria"}, "7005882312": {"Name": "Pompili M.", "AuthorID": "7005882312", "AffiliationID": "60084996, 60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences and Mental Health and Sensory Organs Suicide Prevention Center, Sant\u2019 Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "12762952600": {"Name": "Tarricone I.", "AuthorID": "12762952600", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, Bologna University"}, "8672074400": {"Name": "Tosato S.", "AuthorID": "8672074400", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychiatry, Department of Public Health, Community Medicine University of Verona"}}}
