It also has relevance as a potential immobilizer of the toxic element cobalt in the natural environment, but its detailed crystal structure is so far unknown. The structure of Co2 CO3 (OH)2 has now been investigated using density functional theory (DFT) simulations and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements on samples synthesized via deposition from aqueous solution. Two possible monoclinic phases are considered, with closely related but symmetrically different crystal structures, based on those of the minerals malachite [Cu 2 CO3 (OH)2] and rosasite [Cu 1.5 Zn 0.5 CO3 (OH)2], as well as an orthorhombic phase that can be seen as a common parent structure for the two monoclinic phases, and a triclinic phase with the structure of the mineral kolwezite [Cu 1.34 Co 0.66 CO3 (OH)2]. The DFT simulations predict that the rosasite-like and malachite-like phases are two different local minima of the potential energy landscape for Co2 CO3 (OH)2 and are practically degenerate in energy, while the orthorhombic and triclinic structures are unstable and experience barrierless transformations to the malachite phase upon relaxation. The best fit to the PXRD data is obtained using a rosasite model [monoclinic with space group P112 1/n and cell parameters a = 3.1408 (4) \u00c5, b = 12.2914 (17) \u00c5, c = 9.3311 (16) \u00c5 and \u03b3 = 82.299 (16)\u00b0]. However, some features of the PXRD pattern are still not well accounted for by this refinement and the residual parameters are relatively poor. The relationship between the rosasite and malachite phases of Co2 CO3 (OH)2 is discussed and it is shown that they can be seen as polytypes. Based on the similar calculated stabilities of these two polytypes, it is speculated that some level of stacking disorder could account for the poor fit of the PXRD data. The possibility that Co2 CO3 (OH)2 could crystallize, under different growth conditions, as either rosasite or malachite, or even as a stacking-disordered phase intermediate between the two, requires further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Co2 CO3 (OH)2", "density functional theory", "malachite", "powder X-ray diffraction", "rosasite"], "IndexKeywords": ["Co2 CO3 (OH)2", "malachite", "Natural environments", "Potential energy landscapes", "Powder X ray diffraction", "Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD)", "Rosasite", "X-ray diffraction investigations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031279959", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56385248900": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez J.", "AuthorID": "56385248900", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Oviedo"}, "7003588207": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Gonz\u00e1lez \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "7003588207", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Oviedo"}, "7202356691": {"Name": "Jimenez A.", "AuthorID": "7202356691", "AffiliationID": "60006793", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Oviedo"}, "7005206877": {"Name": "Cockcroft J.", "AuthorID": "7005206877", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8093195100": {"Name": "Grau-Crespo R.", "AuthorID": "8093195100", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Reading, Whiteknights Campus"}}}
