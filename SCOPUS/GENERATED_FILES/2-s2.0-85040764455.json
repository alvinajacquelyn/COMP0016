The aim is to develop new technologies in the field of X-ray focusing, in particular the application of active and adaptive optics. While very major advances have been made in active/adaptive astronomical optics for visible light, little was previously achieved for X-ray optics where the technological challenges differ because of the much shorter wavelengths involved. The field of X-ray astronomy has been characterized by the development and launch of ever larger observatories with the culmination in the European Space Agency's XMM-Newton and NASA's Chandra missions which are currently operational. XMM-Newton uses a multi-nested structure to provide modest angular resolution (\u223c10 arcsec) but large effective area, while Chandra sacrifices effective area to achieve the optical stability necessary to provide sub-arc second resolution. Currently the European Space Agency (ESA) is engaged in studies of the next generation of X-ray space observatories, with the aim of producing telescopes with increased sensitivity and resolution. To achieve these aims several telescopes have been proposed, for example ESA and NASA's combined International X-ray Observatory (IXO), aimed at spectroscopy, and NASA's Generation-X. In the field of X-ray astronomy sub 0.2 arcsecond resolution with high efficiency would be very exciting. Such resolution is unlikely to be achieved by anything other than an active system. The benefits of a such a high resolution would be important for a range of astrophysics subjects, for example the potential angular resolution offered by active X-ray optics could provide unprecedented structural imaging detail of the Solar Wind bowshock interaction of comets, planets and similar objects and auroral phenomena throughout the Solar system using an observing platform in low Earth orbit. A major aim of the SXO project was to investigate the production of thin actively controlled grazing incident optics for the next generation of X-ray space telescopes. Currently telescope systems are limited in the resolution and sensitivity by the optical quality of the thin shell optics used. As part of its research programme an actively controlled prototype X-ray thin shell telescope optic of dimensions 30x10cm has been developed to bench test the technology. The design is based on thin nickel shells bonded to shaped piezo-electric unimorph actuators made from lead zirconate titanate (PZT).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Astronomical optics", "European Space Agency", "High-resolution space telescope", "Large effective areas", "Lead zirconate titanate", "Research programmes", "Technological challenges", "X ray observatories"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040764455", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6506833394": {"Name": "Doel P.", "AuthorID": "6506833394", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Dept of Physics and Astronomy"}, "24069736100": {"Name": "Atkins C.", "AuthorID": "24069736100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Dept of Physics and Astronomy"}, "7403482947": {"Name": "Brooks D.", "AuthorID": "7403482947", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Dept of Physics and Astronomy"}, "24070521000": {"Name": "Feldman C.", "AuthorID": "24070521000", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester, Dept of Physics and Astronomy"}, "56259878200": {"Name": "Willingale R.", "AuthorID": "56259878200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester, Dept of Physics and Astronomy"}, "7005056283": {"Name": "Button T.", "AuthorID": "7005056283", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, Department of Metallurgy and Materials"}, "24072275900": {"Name": "Rodriguez Sanmartin D.", "AuthorID": "24072275900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, Department of Metallurgy and Materials"}, "6507332801": {"Name": "Meggs C.", "AuthorID": "6507332801", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham, Department of Metallurgy and Materials"}, "24071142900": {"Name": "James A.", "AuthorID": "24071142900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "34979576900": {"Name": "Willis G.", "AuthorID": "34979576900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Holmbury St. Mary"}, "57214307781": {"Name": "Smith A.", "AuthorID": "57214307781", "AffiliationID": "60004762", "AffiliationName": "STFC, Daresbury Laboratory Keckwick Lane"}}}
