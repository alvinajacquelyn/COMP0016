Forge, D. Tuzin and G. Bateson, and developed by researchers such as A. Gell, C. Kaufmann and C. Severi. I suggest that one of the non-verbal devices that these figures rely on, betrays an underlying idea of images-as-potential-receptacle, itself based on a reference to the human body as container. Sepik artists can thus use motifs (as visual, material and spatial arrangements) which trigger inferential (indexical, iconic, and/or mnemonic) processes that evoke container-like capacities by reference to the human figure. Based on this hypothesis, I explore the ways in which the surfaces of artefacts are treated in order to both reveal and conceal an interior, as a possible container of ancestral capacities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Art", "Body", "Containers", "Motifs", "Semiotics", "Sepik", "Surface"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058836378", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"35224460500": {"Name": "Coupaye L.", "AuthorID": "35224460500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, CREDO"}}}
