This program facilitates efficient Monte Carlo sampling of prior probabilities for inflationary model parameters and initial conditions and is the first publicly available code that can efficiently generate large sample-sets for inflation models with O fields. The code numerically solves the equations of motion for the background and first-order perturbations of multi-field inflation models with canonical kinetic terms and arbitrary potentials, providing the adiabatic, isocurvature, and tensor power spectra at the end of inflation. For models with sum-separable potentials MULTIMODECODE also computes the slow-roll prediction via the \u03b4 N formalism for easy model exploration and validation. We pay particular attention to the isocurvature perturbations as the system approaches the adiabatic limit, showing how to avoid numerical instabilities that affect some other approaches to this problem. We demonstrate the use of MULTIMODECODE by exploring a few toy models. Finally, we give a concise review of multifield perturbation theory and a user's manual for the program.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmological perturbation theory", "ination", "initial conditions and eternal universe", "physics of the early universe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924038285", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"55802658800": {"Name": "Price L.C.", "AuthorID": "55802658800", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Auckland"}, "6701459596": {"Name": "Easther R.", "AuthorID": "6701459596", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Auckland"}, "36494599500": {"Name": "Frazer J.", "AuthorID": "36494599500", "AffiliationID": "60104285", "AffiliationName": "IKERBASQUE, Basque Foundation for Science"}, "18134607400": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "18134607400", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
