The recoiling ion fragments are probed by time-of-flight measurements and two-dimensional velocity map imaging. Correlation analysis of the emission directions of I+ ions recoiling from each end of the molecules reveals significant deviation from axial recoil, i.e., where the I+ ions leave strictly along the I-I symmetry axis. For isolated molecules, the relative angular distribution of the I+ ions is centered at 180 corresponding to perfect axial recoil, but with a full width at half maximum of 30. For molecules inside He droplets, the width of the distribution increases to 45. These results provide a direct measure of the accuracy of Coulomb explosion as a probe of the spatial orientation of molecules, which is particularly relevant in connection with laser-induced molecular alignment and orientation. In addition, our studies show how it is possible to identify fragmentation pathways of the Coulomb explosion for the isolated 1,4-diiodobenzene molecules. Finally, for the 1,4-diiodobenzene molecules in He droplets, it is shown that the angular correlation between fragments from the Coulomb explosion is preserved after they have interacted with the He environment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alignment and orientations", "Angular correlations", "Correlation analysis", "Fragmentation pathways", "Intense femtosecond laser pulse", "Spatial orientations", "Time of flight measurements", "Velocity map imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958012859", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55761418200": {"Name": "Christiansen L.", "AuthorID": "55761418200", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}, "55977165400": {"Name": "Nielsen J.", "AuthorID": "55977165400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Software Development Group, Research IT Services, University College London, Podium Building (1st Floor)"}, "55363547200": {"Name": "Christensen L.", "AuthorID": "55363547200", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Aarhus University"}, "42662454300": {"Name": "Shepperson B.", "AuthorID": "42662454300", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Aarhus University"}, "23971225400": {"Name": "Pentlehner D.", "AuthorID": "23971225400", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Aarhus University"}, "7005611023": {"Name": "Stapelfeldt H.", "AuthorID": "7005611023", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (INANO), Aarhus University"}}}
