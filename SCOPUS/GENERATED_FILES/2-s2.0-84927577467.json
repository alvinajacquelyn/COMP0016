Methods A prospectively created database was reviewed for patients undergoing surgery for duodenal adenocarcinoma in six UK hepatopancreaticobiliary centres from 2000 to 2013. Factors influencing overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) were identified by regression analysis. Results Resection with curative intent was performed in 150 (84\u00b73 per cent) of 178 patients. The postoperative morbidity rate for these patients was 40\u00b70 per cent and the in-hospital mortality rate was 3\u00b73 per cent. Patients who underwent resection had a better median survival than those who had a palliative surgical procedure (84 versus 8 months; P <-0\u00b7001). The 1-, 3- and 5-year overall survival rates for patients who underwent resection were 83\u00b79, 66\u00b77 and 51\u00b72 per cent respectively. Median DFS was 53 months, and 1- and 3-year DFS rates were 80\u00b78 and 56\u00b75 per cent respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that node status (hazard ratio 1\u00b773, 95 per cent c.i. 1\u00b707 to 2\u00b779; P = 0\u00b7006) and lymphovascular invasion (hazard ratio 3\u00b749, 1\u00b783 to 6\u00b764; P = 0\u00b7003) were associated with overall survival. Conclusion Resection of duodenal adenocarcinoma in specialist centres is associated with good long-term survival. Lymphovascular invasion and nodal metastases are independent prognostic indicators.
