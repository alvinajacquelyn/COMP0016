The incorporation of localisation accuracy is essential, as otherwise false detection of switching within a trajectory was observed and diffusion coefficient estimates were inflated. Since our analysis is on a single trajectory basis, we are able to examine heterogeneity between trajectories in a quantitative manner. Applying our method to the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) receptor tagged with latex beads (4 s trajectories at 1000 frames s-1), both intra- and inter-trajectory heterogeneity were detected; 12-26% of trajectories display clear switching between diffusive states dependent on condition, whilst the inter-trajectory variability is highly structured with the diffusion coefficients being related by D1 = 0.68D0 - 1.5 \u00d7 104 nm2 s-1, suggestive that on these time scales we are detecting switching due to a single process. Further, the inter-trajectory variability of the diffusion coefficient estimates (1.6 \u00d7 102 - 2.6 \u00d7 105 nm2 s-1) is very much larger than the measurement uncertainty within trajectories, suggesting that LFA-1 aggregation and cytoskeletal interactions are significantly affecting mobility, whilst the timescales of these processes are distinctly different giving rise to inter- and intra-trajectory variability. There is also an 'immobile' state (defined as D < 3.0 \u00d7 103 nm2 s-1) that is rarely involved in switching, immobility occurring with the highest frequency (47%) under T cell activation (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) treatment) with enhanced cytoskeletal attachment (calpain inhibition). Such 'immobile' states frequently display slow linear drift, potentially reflecting binding to a dynamic actin cortex. Our methods allow significantly more information to be extracted from individual trajectories (ultimately limited by time resolution and time-series length), and allow statistical comparisons between trajectories thereby quantifying inter-trajectory heterogeneity. Such methods will be highly informative for the construction and fitting of molecule mobility models within membranes incorporating aggregation, binding to the cytoskeleton, or traversing membrane microdomains.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cytoskeleton", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1", "Models, Immunological", "T-Lymphocytes", "Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949009252", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56989806800": {"Name": "Slator P.J.", "AuthorID": "56989806800", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Systems Biology Doctoral Training Centre, University of Warwick"}, "6603705509": {"Name": "Burroughs N.J.", "AuthorID": "6603705509", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Systems Biology Centre, University of Warwick"}, "6701726239": {"Name": "Cairo C.W.", "AuthorID": "6701726239", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta"}}}
