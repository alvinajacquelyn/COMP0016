KGaA, WeinheimMetal\u2013amine solutions provide a unique arena in which to study electrons in solution, and to tune the electron density from the extremes of electrolytic through to true metallic behavior. The existence and structure of a new class of concentrated metal-amine liquid, Li\u2013NH3\u2013MeNH2, is presented in which the mixed solvent produces a novel type of electron solvation and delocalization that is fundamentally different from either of the constituent systems. NMR, ESR, and neutron diffraction allow the environment of the solvated electron and liquid structure to be precisely interrogated. Unexpectedly it was found that the solution is truly homogeneous and metallic. Equally surprising was the observation of strong longer-range order in this mixed solvent system. This is despite the heterogeneity of the cation solvation, and it is concluded that the solvated electron itself acts as a structural template. This is a quite remarkable observation, given that the liquid is metallic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amines", "conducting materials", "electron transfer", "electronic structure", "phase transitions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conducting materials", "Electron solvation", "Electron transfer", "Liquid structures", "Metallic behaviors", "Mixed-solvent systems", "Solvated electron", "Structural templates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010915196", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"36440352500": {"Name": "Seel A.G.", "AuthorID": "36440352500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "34770527900": {"Name": "Edwards P.P.", "AuthorID": "34770527900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55823165100": {"Name": "Swan H.", "AuthorID": "55823165100", "AffiliationID": "60100032", "AffiliationName": "National Nuclear Laboratory, Culham Science Centre"}, "6603824983": {"Name": "Wasse J.C.", "AuthorID": "6603824983", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "13404423400": {"Name": "Weller T.", "AuthorID": "13404423400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7202774632": {"Name": "Howard C.A.", "AuthorID": "7202774632", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7003890182": {"Name": "Skipper N.T.", "AuthorID": "7003890182", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57196793409": {"Name": "Bowron D.T.", "AuthorID": "57196793409", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Spallation Neutron Source, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Chilton"}}}
