The transcription factor E2F1 is a down-stream target of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1 and is up-regulated in TKI-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSC). Pyrrole imidazole polyamides (PA) are minor groove binders which can be programmed to target DNA sequences in a gene-selective manner. This manuscript describes such an approach with a PA designed to down-regulate E2F1 controlled gene expression by targeting a DNA sequence within 100 base pairs (bp) upstream of the E2F1 consensus sequence. Human BC-CML KCL22 cells were assessed after treatment with PA, TKI or their combination. Our PA inhibited BC-CML cell expansion based on cell density analysis compared to an untreated control after a 48-hour time-course of PA treatment. However, no evidence of cell cycle arrest was observed among BC-CML cells treated with PA, with respect to their no drug control counterparts. Thus, this work demonstrates that PAs are effective in inhibiting E2F1 TF activity which results in a temporal reduction in BC-CML cell number. We envisage that PAs could be used in the future to map genes under E2F1 control in CML LSCs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blast crisis CML", "Chronic myeloid leukemia", "E2F transcription factor 1", "Leukemia stem cells", "Pyrrole-imidazole polyamide", "Tyrosine kinase inhibitor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Blast Crisis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor", "E2F1 Transcription Factor", "Humans", "Imidazoles", "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive", "Molecular Structure", "Nylons", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Pyrroles", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069973059", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57198515791": {"Name": "Hayatigolkhatmi K.", "AuthorID": "57198515791", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57198491181": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Casta\u00f1eda E.", "AuthorID": "57198491181", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "9535078100": {"Name": "Hsieh Y.C.", "AuthorID": "9535078100", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57195731367": {"Name": "Jackson L.", "AuthorID": "57195731367", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7202554827": {"Name": "J\u00f8rgensen H.G.", "AuthorID": "7202554827", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "56313029800": {"Name": "Padroni G.", "AuthorID": "56313029800", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde"}, "6604057873": {"Name": "Burley G.A.", "AuthorID": "6604057873", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde"}, "56337773500": {"Name": "Su W.", "AuthorID": "56337773500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nanomedicine, Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56563430100": {"Name": "Fang L.", "AuthorID": "56563430100", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nanomedicine, Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "12446243000": {"Name": "Pellicano F.", "AuthorID": "12446243000", "AffiliationID": "60031990", "AffiliationName": "Drug Discovery Program, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute"}}}
