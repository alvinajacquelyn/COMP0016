Multiple significant correlations were found involving the work style vocational interest factor (consisting of job security, stamina, accountability, planfulness, and interpersonal confidence) and the social vocational interest factor (which included interests in the social sciences, personal services, teaching, social services, and elementary education), both of which correlated significantly with all of the TEIQue variables (well-being, self-control, emotionality, sociability, and global trait EI). Following bivariate genetic analyses, most of the significant phenotypic correlations were found to also have significant genetic correlations as well as significant non-shared (unique) environmental correlations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["behavioral genetics", "TEIQue", "trait emotional intelligence", "trait emotional self-efficacy", "vocational interests"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Emotional Intelligence", "Female", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quantitative Trait, Heritable", "Twins, Dizygotic", "Twins, Monozygotic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928624998", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55350330300": {"Name": "Schermer J.", "AuthorID": "55350330300", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Management and Organizational Studies, University of Western Ontario"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}, "7005924967": {"Name": "Vernon P.", "AuthorID": "7005924967", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Western Ontario"}}}
