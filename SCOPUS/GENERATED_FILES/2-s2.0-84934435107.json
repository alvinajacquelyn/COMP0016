We have reviewed nephrocalcinosis in relation to its definition, genetic associations, animal models, and putative mechanisms. We have concluded, and hypothesized, that nephrocalcinosis is primarily a renal interstitial process, resembling metastatic calcification, and that it may have some features in common with, and pathogenic links to, vascular calcification.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone", "Calcium", "Hypercalciuria", "Hyperoxaluria", "Mineral metabolism", "Urology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium", "Calcium Oxalate", "Calcium Phosphates", "Disease Models, Animal", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Kidney Tubules", "Nephrocalcinosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934435107", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"6506912214": {"Name": "Shavit L.", "AuthorID": "6506912214", "AffiliationID": "60022846", "AffiliationName": "Adult Nephrology Unit, Shaare Zedek Medical Center"}, "9040942200": {"Name": "Jaeger P.", "AuthorID": "9040942200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Campus and Hospital, University College London"}, "8234615900": {"Name": "Unwin R.", "AuthorID": "8234615900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Campus and Hospital, University College London"}}}
