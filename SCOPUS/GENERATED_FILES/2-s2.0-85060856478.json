An increasingly popular approach is to use a scanning laser to acquire surface condition data from a vehicle moving at normal traffic speeds. However, due to the high-density of received data such data collection systems usually are designed with off-line processing. This increases the system cost as a large storage device is required and limits the potential application of the approach. In this paper, we present a robust approach for road assessment which uses point lasers that output low-density 1D scanning data from the road surface and can be processed in real-time allied to a low-complexity signal processing algorithm to assess the road condition data. The experimental results indicate that the point laser and proposed concepts together provide a reliable and adequate means of road condition assessment compared with an approach which uses the scanning laser.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Low-Complexity", "Point Laser", "Road Condition Assessment", "Signal Processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data collection system", "Low-Complexity", "Off-line processing", "Road condition", "Road maintenance", "Robust approaches", "Signal processing algorithms", "Surface conditions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060856478", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190582547": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57190582547", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "56233001700": {"Name": "Burrow M.", "AuthorID": "56233001700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Birmingham"}, "57205625529": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "57205625529", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Birmingham"}}}
