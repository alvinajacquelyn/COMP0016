Linking time spent in different daily activities to energy expenditure (EE) is one way of investigating the health and physiological consequences of behaviour and identifying targets to improve population health and well-being. Methods: We estimated behaviour-related EE for respondents to time use surveys (TUS) from three countries: UK 2001, Poland 2012 and US 2003-13. The Harmonised Multinational Time Use Survey (MTUS) activity categories were matched to MET estimates from the 2011 Compendium of Physical Activities. We attach METs values to each successive activity in the TUS, together with both the original UK, Polish and US activity classifications and the 68-category MTUS activity classification. We used TUS estimates of activity durations across 24-h to estimate the Physical Activity Level (PAL) for respondents from the three countries and the average time spent and MET values for different activity categories. Results: PAL values ranged from 1.59 in the US to 1.74 in Poland. The main sources of daily EE from PA were paid and unpaid work activities. Discretionary PA accounted for only a very small part (~ 3%) of adult daily energy expenditures. Using the harmonised MTUS 68-activity classification reduced the variability of the aggregate PAEE measure by ~ 20%, but the patterns of association between key demographics (age, sex, educational attainment) were unaffected. TUS data were further used to (1) identify sources of daily PA, and (2) assess adherence to physical activity guidelines (PAG) on a single-day basis. Estimated adherence levels were similar to those reported from other TUS as well as frequency based estimates. Conclusions: Comparative studies of energy expenditure based on harmonised time use activity categories could provide insight into the relative importance of different activities for energy expenditure across different countries and demographic groups. However, new observational studies combining TUS data with accelerometer, direct observation and other measures of activity intensity are required for more accurate MET assignments to activity categories in TUS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ainsworth compendia", "Metabolic equivalent of task", "METs linkage", "Physical activity", "Physical activity energy expenditure", "Time use diary", "Time use survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adult", "Energy Metabolism", "Exercise", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Human Activities", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Poland", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066866624", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57090181300": {"Name": "Harms T.", "AuthorID": "57090181300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, Centre for Time Use Research, University College London"}, "57220340466": {"Name": "Gershuny J.", "AuthorID": "57220340466", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, Centre for Time Use Research, University College London"}, "7004503131": {"Name": "Berrigan D.", "AuthorID": "7004503131", "AffiliationID": "60013409", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences"}}}
