All rights reserved.Background: The phase 3 studies of telaprevir (T) in combination with peginterferon \u03b1-2a and ribavirin (PR) in treatmentnaive genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus-infected patients (ADVANCE/ILLUMINATE) were not designed a priori to assess the effect of race and ethnicity on treatment response. However, these factors are important given the lower sustained virologic response (SVR) rates observed in black and Hispanic/Latino patients treated with PR. Goals: This retrospective pooled analysis evaluated the effect of race or ethnicity on treatment-naive patient response to telaprevirbased therapy and assessed resistant variant profiles. Materials and Methods: This analysis comprised patients enrolled in ADVANCE (N=363) and ILLUMINATE (N=540) who received 12 weeks of telaprevir in combination with PR followed by 12 or 36 weeks of PR alone and patients in ADVANCE (N=361) who received 48 weeks of PR alone. Race and ethnicity were selfreported and not mutually exclusive. Results: Higher SVR rates were observed with telaprevir-based therapy compared with PR in blacks [n=99 (62%) vs. n=28 (29%), respectively] and in Hispanics/Latinos [n=89 (72%) vs. n=38 (39%)]. The SVR was lower in telaprevir-treated blacks [n=99 (62%)] compared with nonblacks [n=791 (78%)] and in Hispanic/Latinos compared with non-Hispanics/Latinos [n=89 (72%) vs. n=801 (76%)]. Low discontinuation rates due to adverse events, including rash and anemia, were observed across subgroups. Resistance profiles were similar among the subgroups. Conclusions: Treatment-naive black and Hispanic/Latino patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C virus infection may benefit from telaprevir-based therapy, an important finding given the lower SVR rates observed in these patients when they are treated with PR alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Combination drug therapy", "Ethnology", "Hepatitis C virus", "Liver diseases", "Protease inhibitors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antiviral Agents", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Genotype", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Interferon-alpha", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oligopeptides", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Recombinant Proteins", "Retrospective Studies", "Ribavirin", "Viral Load", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928362462", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"7004142194": {"Name": "Flamm S.L.", "AuthorID": "7004142194", "AffiliationID": "60013227, 60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"}, "35404639300": {"Name": "Muir A.J.", "AuthorID": "35404639300", "AffiliationID": "60030982", "AffiliationName": "Duke Clinical Research Institute"}, "57203774529": {"Name": "Fried M.W.", "AuthorID": "57203774529", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "57218644067": {"Name": "Rajender Reddy K.", "AuthorID": "57218644067", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine"}, "57200281079": {"Name": "Nelson D.R.", "AuthorID": "57200281079", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Florida"}, "6602102815": {"Name": "Bzowej N.H.", "AuthorID": "6602102815", "AffiliationID": "60021137", "AffiliationName": "California Pacific Medical Center"}, "56391711000": {"Name": "Sullivan J.C.", "AuthorID": "56391711000", "AffiliationID": "60031897", "AffiliationName": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated"}, "20336494200": {"Name": "Bengtsson L.", "AuthorID": "20336494200", "AffiliationID": "60031897", "AffiliationName": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated"}, "57197137071": {"Name": "Wright C.I.", "AuthorID": "57197137071", "AffiliationID": "60031897", "AffiliationName": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated"}, "7003480480": {"Name": "Kieffer T.L.", "AuthorID": "7003480480", "AffiliationID": "60031897", "AffiliationName": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated"}, "18535081900": {"Name": "George S.", "AuthorID": "18535081900", "AffiliationID": "60031897", "AffiliationName": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated"}, "15838879600": {"Name": "Adda N.", "AuthorID": "15838879600", "AffiliationID": "60031897", "AffiliationName": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated"}, "8761010500": {"Name": "DeMasi R.", "AuthorID": "8761010500", "AffiliationID": "60027736", "AffiliationName": "Janssen Research and Development"}, "7006885162": {"Name": "Dusheiko G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006885162", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free and University College"}}}
