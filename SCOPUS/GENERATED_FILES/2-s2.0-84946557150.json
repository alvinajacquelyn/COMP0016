All rights reserved.Conventional therapies seem to have reached the limit of their ability to treat patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To improve the outcome for these patients, new drugs are needed. Several attempts have been made to introduce targeted therapies for this complex disease. One of these targets is interferon \u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), whose production is increased in SLE, contributing to its pathogenesis. In this review we consider some recent advances in IFN-\u03b1-targeting approaches. Three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against several IFN-\u03b1 subtypes have been tested in phase I and II trials, showing an acceptable safety profile and promising results in terms of reducing the IFN signature and disease activity. A MAb specific for the IFN-\u03b1 receptor and active immunization against IFN-\u03b1 are also being tested. Further trials will be essential to ascertain the safety and efficacy of all these approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AGS-009", "Interferon \u03b1", "Rontalizumab", "Sifalimumab", "Systemic lupus erythematosus"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946557150", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56669650600": {"Name": "Farinha F.", "AuthorID": "56669650600", "AffiliationID": "115930092", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Department, Centro Hospitalar Do Baixo Vouga E.P.E."}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
