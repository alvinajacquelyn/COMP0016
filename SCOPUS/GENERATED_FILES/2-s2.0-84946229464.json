It provides a 1 MHz, 1 mAp-p current with a phase delay of 16\u00b0 into a1k\u03a9 load. While it can be designed as a stand-alone circuit its main use is for application in a proposed circuit using multiple copies of this basic circuit, which significantly extends its high frequency performance by substantially reducing phase delay at high frequencies. The circuit was fabricated in a 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS technology and measured results are presented. It is intended for bioimpedance applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CMOS technology", "Current drivers", "Feedback currents", "High frequency characteristics", "High frequency HF", "High frequency performance", "Measured results", "Transconductors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946229464", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"38961723700": {"Name": "Neshatvar N.", "AuthorID": "38961723700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL) Torrington Place"}, "36936417600": {"Name": "Langlois P.", "AuthorID": "36936417600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL) Torrington Place"}, "15922999900": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "15922999900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL) Torrington Place"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL) Torrington Place"}}}
