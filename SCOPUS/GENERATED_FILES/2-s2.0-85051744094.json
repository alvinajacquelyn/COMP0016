Apart from timely reperfusion by primary percutaneous coronary intervention, there is currently no established therapy for reducing MI size. Thus, new cardioprotective therapies are required to improve clinical outcomes after ST-segment- elevation MI. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance has emerged as an important imaging modality for assessing the efficacy of novel therapies for reducing MI size and preventing subsequent adverse left ventricular remodeling. The recent availability of multiparametric mapping cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging has provided new insights into the pathophysiology underlying myocardial edema, microvascular obstruction, intramyocardial hemorrhage, and changes in the remote myocardial interstitial space after ST-segment-elevation MI. In this article, we provide an overview of the recent advances in cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging in reperfused patients with ST-segment-elevation MI, discuss the controversies surrounding its use, and explore future applications of cardiovascular magnetic resonance in this setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hemorrhage", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Percutaneous coronary intervention", "ST elevation myocardial infarction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Myocardial Reperfusion", "Myocardium", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Tissue Survival", "Treatment Outcome", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051744094", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"53981151600": {"Name": "Bulluck H.", "AuthorID": "53981151600", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Royal Papworth Hospital"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University Singapore"}, "14119371500": {"Name": "Dharmakumar R.", "AuthorID": "14119371500", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California"}, "7103347595": {"Name": "Arai A.E.", "AuthorID": "7103347595", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Advanced Cardiovascular Imaging, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "57203056149": {"Name": "Berry C.", "AuthorID": "57203056149", "AffiliationID": "60032768, 60001490, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Center, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}}}
