The presence of a spontaneous and powerful static electric field within the film, the defining characteristic of spontelectric solids, is demonstrated through observations of longitudinal-transverse optical (LO-TO) splitting in RAIR spectra, using an analysis based on the vibrational Stark effect. In particular the dependence of the LO-TO splitting on the film deposition temperature may be wholly attributed to the known temperature dependence of the spontelectric field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938651046", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"30467841400": {"Name": "Lasne J.", "AuthorID": "30467841400", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "55308126000": {"Name": "Rosu-Finsen A.", "AuthorID": "55308126000", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "6603830532": {"Name": "McCoustra M.", "AuthorID": "6603830532", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "54410288000": {"Name": "Cassidy A.", "AuthorID": "54410288000", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}, "36730399300": {"Name": "Field D.", "AuthorID": "36730399300", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}}}
