The synthetic route yielded multi\u2013gram quantities of an isomeric racemate mixture in a short number of steps. When tested in hippocampal slices from young adult rats the compound enhanced AMPA receptor\u2013mediated signalling at mossy fibre synapses, and potentiated inward currents evoked by local application of L\u2013glutamate onto CA3 pyramidal neurons. It facilitated the induction of mossy fibre LTP, but the magnitude of potentiation was smaller than that observed in untreated slices. The racemic mixture was separated and it was shown that only the (\u2212) enantiomer was active. Toxicity analysis indicated that cell lines tolerated the compound at concentrations well above those enhancing synaptic transmission. Our results unveil a small molecule whose physiological signature resembles that of a potent nootropic drug.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CA3 Region, Hippocampal", "Glutamic Acid", "Long-Term Potentiation", "Male", "Mossy Fibers, Hippocampal", "Nootropic Agents", "Pyrrolidinones", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, AMPA", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050877776", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56993373500": {"Name": "Szulc B.R.", "AuthorID": "56993373500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102480402": {"Name": "Hilton S.T.", "AuthorID": "7102480402", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7203007334": {"Name": "Ruiz A.J.", "AuthorID": "7203007334", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
