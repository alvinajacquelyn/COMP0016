Tonal reduction refers to the phenomenon of the tones of a disyllabic unit being contracted into a monosyllabic unit. An experiment was carried out in which six native Taiwan Mandarin male speakers produced sentences containing disyllabic compound words /ma/+/ma/ with varying tonal combinations at different speech rates. Analyses indicated that increasing time pressure led to severe tonal reductions. Articulatory effort, measured by the slope of F0 peak velocity of unidirectional movement over F0 movement amplitude, is insufficient to compensate for duration-dependent undershoot (in particular, when time pressure exceeds certain thresholds). Mechanisms of tonal reduction were further examined by comparing F0 velocity profiles against the Edge-in model, a rule-based phonological model. Results showed that the residual tonal variants in contracted syllables are gradient rather than categorical\u2014as duration is shortened, the movement towards the desired targets is gradually curtailed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["articulatory effort", "disyllabic contraction", "Edge-in model", "F0 velocity profile", "hyper- and hypo-articulation", "Taiwan Mandarin", "target undershoot", "time pressure", "Tonal reduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Humans", "Language", "Male", "Phonetics", "Sound Spectrography", "Speech Acoustics", "Speech Articulation Tests", "Speech Production Measurement", "Taiwan", "Time Factors", "Verbal Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940913343", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"35178932300": {"Name": "Cheng C.", "AuthorID": "35178932300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "55695016900": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "55695016900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}}}
