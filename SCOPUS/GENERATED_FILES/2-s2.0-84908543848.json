Bacterial entry and replication require a type III secretion system (T3SS), a widely conserved nanomachine responsible for the translocation of virulence effectors into host cells. Recent cell biology experiments supported by electron and cryo-electron tomography have provided fresh insights into Chlamydia-host interactions. In this review, we highlight some of the recent advances, particularly the in situ analysis of T3SSs in contact with host membranes during chlamydial entry and intracellular replication, and the role of the host rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) at the recently described intracellular 'pathogen synapse'.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Secretion Systems", "Cell Membrane", "Chlamydia", "Endocytosis", "Macromolecular Substances", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908543848", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55353693700": {"Name": "Dumoux M.", "AuthorID": "55353693700", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "35495822100": {"Name": "Hayward R.D.", "AuthorID": "35495822100", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London and Birkbeck"}, "25925899200": {"Name": "Nans A.", "AuthorID": "25925899200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Crystallography, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "35492295700": {"Name": "Saibil H.R.", "AuthorID": "35492295700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Crystallography, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
