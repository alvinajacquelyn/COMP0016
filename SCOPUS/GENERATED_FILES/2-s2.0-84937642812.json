Implantation of Si-scaffolds loaded with antigen-activated macrophages induced an inflammatory reaction along with antigen-specific antibody production in vivo, which could be detected even 30 days post implantation. Analysis of implant histology using scanning electron microscopy showed that Si-scaffolds could be stable for a 6-month period. Such technology leads to personalized implantable vaccines, opening novel areas of research and treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Immune response", "Laser manufacturing", "Macrophage", "Scaffold implantation", "Silicon scaffold", "Vaccination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Transplantation", "Macrophage Activation", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Tissue Scaffolds", "Treatment Outcome", "Vaccination", "Vaccines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937642812", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55599819300": {"Name": "Zerva I.", "AuthorID": "55599819300", "AffiliationID": "60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Crete, Vassilika Vouton"}, "55987630400": {"Name": "Simitzi C.", "AuthorID": "55987630400", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL), Foundation for Research and Technology, Vassilika Vouton"}, "12042553300": {"Name": "Siakouli-Galanopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "12042553300", "AffiliationID": "60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Crete, Vassilika Vouton"}, "7003652660": {"Name": "Athanassakis I.", "AuthorID": "7003652660", "AffiliationID": "60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Crete, Vassilika Vouton"}, "23010133500": {"Name": "Ranella A.", "AuthorID": "23010133500", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL), Foundation for Research and Technology, Vassilika Vouton"}, "56234734200": {"Name": "Stratakis E.", "AuthorID": "56234734200", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Laser (IESL), Foundation for Research and Technology, Vassilika Vouton"}, "7006485099": {"Name": "Fotakis C.", "AuthorID": "7006485099", "AffiliationID": "60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Crete, Vassilika Vouton"}}}
