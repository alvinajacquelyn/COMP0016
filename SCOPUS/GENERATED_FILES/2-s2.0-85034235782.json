A study of various ionized solutions of different concentrations is performed. A 2 mol KCl solution is selected as the fluid for the switch because of its relatively good properties in conductivity, relative permittivity, and loss tangent. The fluid-switched reconfigurable Vivaldi antenna can function well between two user-defined operating bands: 3.2 and 4.5 GHz with stable measured gain of 11 dBi in both bands and an isolation of 15 dB. This reconfigurable antenna demonstrates that a low-cost fluid switch may be an alternative device for reconfigurable antenna designs providing more flexibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ionized solutions", "reconfigurable antennas"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna measurement", "Frequency agile", "Operating bands", "Operating frequency bands", "Radio frequencies", "Reconfigurable antenna", "Relative permittivity", "Vivaldi antennas"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034235782", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201645178": {"Name": "Borda-Fortuny C.", "AuthorID": "57201645178", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54787343500": {"Name": "Al-Armaghany A.", "AuthorID": "54787343500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
