Published by Oxford University Press.Aprataxin (APTX) deficiency causes progressive cerebellar degeneration, ataxia and oculomotor apraxia in man. Cell free assays and crystal structure studies demonstrate a role for APTX in resolving 5--adenylated nucleic acid breaks, however, APTX function in vertebrates remains unclear due to the lack of an appropriate model system. Here, we generated a murine model in which a pathogenic mutant of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1G93A) is expressed in an Aptx-/- mouse strain. We report a delayed population doubling and accelerated senescence in Aptx-/- primary mouse fibroblasts, which is not due to detectable telomere instability or cell cycle deregulation but is associated with a reduction in transcription recovery following oxidative stress. Expression of SOD1G93A uncovers a survival defect ex vivo in cultured cells and in vivo in tissues lacking Aptx. The surviving neurons feature numerous and deep nuclear envelope invaginations, a hallmark of cellular stress. Furthermore, they possess an elevated number of high-density nuclear regions and a concomitant increase in histone H3 K9 trimethylation, hallmarks of silenced chromatin. Finally, the accelerated cellular senescence was also observed at the organismal level as shown by down-regulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a hallmark of premature ageing. Together, this study demonstrates a protective role of Aptx in vivo and suggests that its loss results in progressive accumulation of DNA breaks in the nervous system, triggering hallmarks of premature ageing, systemically.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aging, Premature", "Animals", "Cell Aging", "Cells, Cultured", "Disease Models, Animal", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Humans", "Hydrogen Peroxide", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I", "Mice", "Motor Neurons", "Mutation", "Nuclear Proteins", "Oxidative Stress", "Superoxide Dismutase", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922463434", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7402034865": {"Name": "Carroll J.", "AuthorID": "7402034865", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Center, University of Sussex"}, "8257352000": {"Name": "El-Khamisy S.F.", "AuthorID": "8257352000", "AffiliationID": "60104893", "AffiliationName": "Center of Genomics, Helmy Institute for Medical Sciences, Zewail City of Science and Technology"}, "54416212900": {"Name": "Page T.K.W.", "AuthorID": "54416212900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Science, University of Sussex"}, "56509203900": {"Name": "Bode D.", "AuthorID": "56509203900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Science, University of Sussex"}, "7102616738": {"Name": "Thorpe J.R.", "AuthorID": "7102616738", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Science, University of Sussex"}, "55991366400": {"Name": "Hafezparast M.", "AuthorID": "55991366400", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Science, University of Sussex"}, "36010572500": {"Name": "Chiang S.C.", "AuthorID": "36010572500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Krebs Institute, University of Sheffield"}, "6603446760": {"Name": "Kalmar B.", "AuthorID": "6603446760", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203069719": {"Name": "Greensmith L.", "AuthorID": "57203069719", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57193378843": {"Name": "McKinnon P.J.", "AuthorID": "57193378843", "AffiliationID": "60019905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital"}}}
