KGaA, WeinheimA composite of the metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) NH2-MIL-125(Ti) and molecular and ionic nickel(II) species, catalyzed hydrogen evolution from water under UV light. In 95 v/v % aqueous conditions the composite produced hydrogen in quantities two orders of magnitude higher than that of the virgin framework and an order of magnitude greater than that of the molecular catalyst. In a 2 v/v % water and acetonitrile mixture, the composite demonstrated a TOF of 28 mol H2g(Ni)\u22121h\u22121and remained active for up to 50 h, sustaining catalysis for three times longer and yielding 20-fold the amount of hydrogen. Appraisal of physical mixtures of the MOF and each of the nickel species under identical photocatalytic conditions suggest that similar surface localized light sensitization and proton reduction processes operate in the composite catalyst. Both nickel species contribute to catalytic conversion, although different activation behaviors are observed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hydrogen", "metal\u2013organic frameworks", "nickel", "photocatalysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activation behavior", "Aqueous condition", "Catalytic conversion", "Composite catalysts", "Hydrogen evolution", "Molecular catalysts", "Orders of magnitude", "Physical mixtures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987794632", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57191192639": {"Name": "Meyer K.", "AuthorID": "57191192639", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "7004087000": {"Name": "van Bokhoven J.A.", "AuthorID": "7004087000", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Catalysis and Sustainable Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute"}, "57220500390": {"Name": "Bashir S.", "AuthorID": "57220500390", "AffiliationID": "117367820", "AffiliationName": "SABIC"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "117367820", "AffiliationName": "SABIC"}, "26039349400": {"Name": "Llorca J.", "AuthorID": "26039349400", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy Technologies, and Centre for Research in NanoEngineering, Technical University of Catalonia"}, "26434839400": {"Name": "Ranocchiari M.", "AuthorID": "26434839400", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Catalysis and Sustainable Chemistry, Paul Scherrer Institute"}}}
