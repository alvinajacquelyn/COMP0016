A scalable error-corrected quantum processor, however, will require control of many qubits in parallel, while performing error detection across the constituent qubits. Spin resonance techniques are a convenient path to parallel two-axis control, while Pauli spin blockade can be used to realize local parity measurements for error detection. Despite this, silicon qubit implementations have so far focused on either single-spin resonance control, or control and measurement via voltage-pulse detuning in the two-spin singlet\u2013triplet basis, but not both simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate an integrated device platform incorporating a silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor double quantum dot that is capable of single-spin addressing and control via electron spin resonance, combined with high-fidelity spin readout in the singlet-triplet basis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055615479", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56783881000": {"Name": "Fogarty M.A.", "AuthorID": "56783881000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "36241451800": {"Name": "Chan K.W.", "AuthorID": "36241451800", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "6701519545": {"Name": "Hensen B.", "AuthorID": "6701519545", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "56920922500": {"Name": "Huang W.", "AuthorID": "56920922500", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "55446775700": {"Name": "Tanttu T.", "AuthorID": "55446775700", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "55861862900": {"Name": "Yang C.H.", "AuthorID": "55861862900", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "18536478200": {"Name": "Laucht A.", "AuthorID": "18536478200", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "8625632100": {"Name": "Hudson F.E.", "AuthorID": "8625632100", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "7005087193": {"Name": "Morello A.", "AuthorID": "7005087193", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "7004650676": {"Name": "Dzurak A.S.", "AuthorID": "7004650676", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60160443", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales"}, "26538386900": {"Name": "Veldhorst M.", "AuthorID": "26538386900", "AffiliationID": "60117987, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "QuTech and Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, TU Delft"}, "24558798900": {"Name": "Itoh K.M.", "AuthorID": "24558798900", "AffiliationID": "60025997", "AffiliationName": "School of Fundamental Science and Technology, Keio University"}, "6508085925": {"Name": "Culcer D.", "AuthorID": "6508085925", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, The University of New South Wales"}, "8433106500": {"Name": "Ladd T.D.", "AuthorID": "8433106500", "AffiliationID": "60021939", "AffiliationName": "HRL Laboratories, LLC"}}}
