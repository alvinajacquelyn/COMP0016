All rights reserved.Hexamidine diisethionate (HEX D) has been used for its biocidal actions in topical preparations since the 1950s. Recent data also suggest that it plays a beneficial role in skin homeostasis. To date, the extent to which this compound penetrates the epidermis has not been reported nor how its topical delivery may be modulated. In the present work we set out to characterise the interaction of HEX D with the skin and to develop a range of simple formulations for topical targeting of the active. A further objective was to compare the skin penetration of HEX D with its corresponding dihydrochloride salt (HEX H) as the latter has more favourable physicochemical properties for skin uptake. Candidate vehicles were evaluated by in vitro Franz cell permeation studies using porcine skin. Initially, neat solvents were investigated and subsequently binary systems were examined. The solvents and chemical penetration enhancers investigated included glycerol, dimethyl isosorbide (DMI), isopropyl alcohol (IPA), 1,2-pentanol (1,2-PENT), polyethylene glycol (PEG) 200, propylene glycol (PG), propylene glycol monolaurate (PGML) and Transcutol\u00aeP (TC). Of a total of 30 binary solvent systems evaluated only 10 delivered higher amounts of active into the skin compared with the neat solvents. In terms of topical efficacy, formulations containing PGML far surpassed all other solvents or binary combinations. More than 70% of HEX H was extracted from the skin following application in PG:PGML (50:50). Interestingly, the same vehicle effectively promoted skin penetration of HEX D but demonstrated significantly lower uptake into and through the skin (30%). The findings confirm the unpredictable nature of excipients on delivery of actives with reference to skin even where there are minor differences in molecular structures. We also believe that they underline the ongoing necessity for fundamental studies on the interaction of topical excipients with the skin.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemical penetration enhancers", "Formulation", "Hexamidine", "Skin", "Solvents"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Cutaneous", "Animals", "Anti-Infective Agents", "Benzamidines", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Excipients", "Salts", "Skin", "Skin Absorption", "Solvents", "Swine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964584130", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56780056200": {"Name": "Parisi N.", "AuthorID": "56780056200", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57188994595": {"Name": "Paz-Alvarez M.", "AuthorID": "57188994595", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7004473297": {"Name": "Lever R.", "AuthorID": "7004473297", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57213994372": {"Name": "Hadgraft J.", "AuthorID": "57213994372", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56393831400": {"Name": "Lane M.E.", "AuthorID": "56393831400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8560630100": {"Name": "Matts P.J.", "AuthorID": "8560630100", "AffiliationID": "60025856", "AffiliationName": "Procter and Gamble Technical Centres Ltd., London Innovation Centre"}}}
