Distribution or reproduction of this work in whole or in part requires full attribution of the original publication, including its DOI.We designed and developed a control circuit for a three-dimensional (3-D) light-emitting diode (LED) array to be used in volumetric displays exhibiting full-color dynamic 3-D images. The circuit was implemented on a field-programmable gate array; therefore, pulse-width modulation, which requires high-speed processing, could be operated in real time. We experimentally evaluated the developed system by measuring the luminance of an LED with varying input and confirmed that the system works appropriately. In addition, we demonstrated that the volumetric display exhibits different full-color dynamic two-dimensional images in two orthogonal directions. Each of the exhibited images could be obtained only from the prescribed viewpoint. Such directional characteristics of the system are beneficial for applications, including digital signage, security systems, art, and amusement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["digital signage", "field-programmable gate array", "light-emitting diode", "volumetric three-dimensional display"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digital signage", "Directional characteristic", "High-speed processing", "Light emitting diode arrays", "Lightemitting diode(LED) array", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "Two dimensional images", "Volumetric three-dimensional display"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026528142", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"55857904100": {"Name": "Hirayama R.", "AuthorID": "55857904100", "AffiliationID": "60015540", "AffiliationName": "Research Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science"}, "35279839800": {"Name": "Kakue T.", "AuthorID": "35279839800", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Chiba University, Graduate School of Engineering"}, "6603199127": {"Name": "Shimobaba T.", "AuthorID": "6603199127", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Chiba University, Graduate School of Engineering"}, "56102564500": {"Name": "Ito T.", "AuthorID": "56102564500", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Chiba University, Graduate School of Engineering"}, "9737787100": {"Name": "Shiraki A.", "AuthorID": "9737787100", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Chiba University, Institute of Management and Information Technologies"}, "24176114000": {"Name": "Nakayama H.", "AuthorID": "24176114000", "AffiliationID": "60029701", "AffiliationName": "National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Center for Computational Astrophysics"}}}
