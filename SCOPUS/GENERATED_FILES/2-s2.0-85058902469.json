To relate these views, we measured activity in PPC while mice performed a virtual navigation task driven by visual decisions. PPC neurons were selective for specific combinations of the animal\u2019s spatial position and heading angle. This selectivity closely predicted both the activity of individual PPC neurons, and the arrangement of their collective firing patterns in choice-selective sequences. These sequences reflected PPC encoding of the animal\u2019s navigation trajectory. Using decision as a predictor instead of heading yielded worse fits, and using it in addition to heading only slightly improved the fits. Alternative models based on visual or motor variables were inferior. We conclude that when mice use vision to choose their trajectories, a large fraction of parietal cortex activity can be predicted from simple attributes such as spatial position and heading.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Choice Behavior", "Decision Making", "Mice", "Movement", "Neurons", "Parietal Lobe", "Vision, Ocular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058902469", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"28267736400": {"Name": "Krumin M.", "AuthorID": "28267736400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57195958798": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "57195958798", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6701363142": {"Name": "Carandini M.", "AuthorID": "6701363142", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57211720309": {"Name": "Harris K.", "AuthorID": "57211720309", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
