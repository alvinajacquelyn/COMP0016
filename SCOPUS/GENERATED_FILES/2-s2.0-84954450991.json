Although economic historians have identified and explored various possible explanations (chiefly institutions, political instability, financial development, inflation, trade openness and international financial integration), no study so far has attempted a comprehensive quantitative assessment of their relative importance. This article tries to fill this gap using the power-ARCH framework and annual data since 1896 to study the effects of these factors in terms of both growth and growth volatility. The results highlight two main factors to understand the remarkable growth trajectory of Argentina over the very long run, financial development and institutions (formal and informal political instability) and stress the importance of differences in their short vis-\u00e0-vis long-run behaviour.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954450991", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"7006704860": {"Name": "Campos N.F.", "AuthorID": "7006704860", "AffiliationID": "60007893", "AffiliationName": "IZA"}, "6603067038": {"Name": "Karanasos M.G.", "AuthorID": "6603067038", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Brunel University"}, "51864826700": {"Name": "Tan B.", "AuthorID": "51864826700", "AffiliationID": "60018540", "AffiliationName": "Southwestern University of Finance and Economics"}}}
