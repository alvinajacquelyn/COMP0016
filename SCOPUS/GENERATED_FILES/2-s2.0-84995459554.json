It makes reference to civil engineering projects that incorporate data-acquiring systems and extrapolates the findings to inform strategies on how similar systems can be successfully implemented in buildings. Client-based interviews carried out with stakeholders to challenge this need are referred to. These solicited an appreciation of the main advantages and challenges related to implementing such systems in projects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building information modelling", "Buildings", "Structures & design", "Sustainability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building Information Modelling", "Building structure", "Civil engineering projects", "In-buildings"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995459554", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"57191967127": {"Name": "Xuereb K.", "AuthorID": "57191967127", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57220500364": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "57220500364", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials and Inorganic Chemistry Research Group, University College London"}}}
