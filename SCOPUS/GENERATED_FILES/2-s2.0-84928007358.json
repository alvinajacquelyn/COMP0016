However, there have been no cross-cultural studies examining whether self-reported experiences of stigma vary between ethnic groups. Method: Participants with mild and moderate ID were recruited from a number of different settings in Cape Town, South Africa. Self-reported experiences of stigma in three ethnic groups were measured using the South African version of the Perceived Stigma of Intellectual Disability tool, developed by the authors. One-way anova was used to test whether there were differences in the total stigma score between the ethnic groups. Regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with stigma. Results: A total of 191 participants agreed to take part; 53 were Black, 70 were of mixed ethnicity and 68 were Caucasian. There were no differences in the levels of stigma reported by the three groups but the Black African ethnic group were more likely to report being physically attacked and being stared at, but were also more likely to report that they thought they were 'the same as other people'. There was an interaction effect between ethnicity and level of ID, with participants with mild ID from the Black African group reporting higher levels of stigma compared with those with moderate ID. Younger age was the only factor that was associated with stigma but there was a trend towards ethnicity, additional disability and socio-economic status being related to stigma. Conclusion: Interventions should target the Black African community in South Africa and should include the reduction of both public stigma and self-reported stigma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discrimination", "Ethnicity", "Intellectual disability", "Negative attitudes", "Stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Self Report", "Social Stigma", "South Africa"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928007358", "SubjectAreas": [["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57211194358": {"Name": "Ali A.", "AuthorID": "57211194358", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "54794208300": {"Name": "Kock E.", "AuthorID": "54794208300", "AffiliationID": "112067571", "AffiliationName": "Western Cape Forum for Intellectual Disability, Alexandra Hospital"}, "7004686203": {"Name": "Molteno C.", "AuthorID": "7004686203", "AffiliationID": "60003757, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town, Groote Schuur Hospital"}, "48461606400": {"Name": "Mfiki N.", "AuthorID": "48461606400", "AffiliationID": "112067571", "AffiliationName": "Alexandra Hospital"}}}
