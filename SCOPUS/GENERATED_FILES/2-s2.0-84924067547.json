This review focuses on their roles in axon growth, guidance and repair, as well as more recent findings demonstrating their key roles in pre-synaptic and post-synaptic maturation and function. These enzymes have been linked to memory and neuropsychiatric defects in loss-of-function rodent models, highlighting their potential as future drug targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axon growth", "Axon guidance", "Neurology", "PTP", "Receptor tyrosine phosphatase", "Synapse"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axons", "Humans", "Invertebrates", "Nerve Regeneration", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Synapses", "Vertebrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924067547", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57204334139": {"Name": "Stoker A.", "AuthorID": "57204334139", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
