One widely accepted indicator of electrochemical performance is the triple phase boundary (TPB): a location where the three materials responsible for ionic, electronic and gas-phase reactant transport are in contact. X-ray absorption tomography has been used extensively in the characterisation of these TPBs, utilising the different attenuation properties of the constituent materials. Here we present a quantitative comparison of the attenuation properties for elements commonly employed in solid oxide fuel cell materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attenuation properties", "Constituent materials", "Electrochemical performance", "Gas-phase reactants", "Nano-CT", "Quantitative comparison", "Triple phase boundary", "X-ray attenuation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021907291", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57044825000": {"Name": "Heenan T.", "AuthorID": "57044825000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}}}
