Despite its increased popularity, there is presently no synthesis of the literature pertaining to the performance requirements of squash. As such, it is difficult to generate evidence-based guidelines for applied practitioners working with squash athletes. The purposes of this review were to a) identify the most important aspects of squash performance with reference to junior and senior athletes, b) identify and discuss the available methods of assessment of squash performance and c) identify areas where further research efforts are needed so that the performance requirements of the squash game are understood. Critical analysis of literature pertaining to movement characteristics and time motion analyses, physiological demands, methods of assessing physical qualities, psychological demands and injury epidemiology were conducted. A summary of the physical characteristics of squash athletes of varying ages and playing standards is presented. Time motion analysis studies present consistent information on the game demands. There are limited data on game demands evolution from youth to senior. There appears to be usable testing protocols available for practitioners supporting squash athletes, although further work is needed to determine the applicability of these measures in junior athletes. Furthermore, better controlled studies are required to establish the injury risks associated with squash.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Performance analysis", "physiology", "psychology", "racket sport", "sports injury", "tactical behaviour", "time-motion analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052502864", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"55902573200": {"Name": "Jones T.W.", "AuthorID": "55902573200", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Science, ASPIRE, Academy for Sports Excellence"}, "55188603400": {"Name": "Williams B.K.", "AuthorID": "55188603400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Exercise and Sport Science, The University of Sydney"}, "56445782600": {"Name": "Kilgallen C.", "AuthorID": "56445782600", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Science, ASPIRE, Academy for Sports Excellence"}, "57203637374": {"Name": "Shillabeer B.C.", "AuthorID": "57203637374", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Science, ASPIRE, Academy for Sports Excellence"}, "56797352300": {"Name": "Murray A.", "AuthorID": "56797352300", "AffiliationID": "60106885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sports Science, ASPIRE, Academy for Sports Excellence"}, "7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60108464", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Sport, Health and Well-Being, University of St Mark & St John"}, "37032543400": {"Name": "Horobeanu C.", "AuthorID": "37032543400", "AffiliationID": "60105844, 60106885", "AffiliationName": "Aspire Academy Health Centre, Aspetar"}}}
