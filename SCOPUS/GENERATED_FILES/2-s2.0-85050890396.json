A parametric study has been carried out to assess the effects of some of the key parameters, including subset size, step size, and the size of the measurement window, on the measurement uncertainties for systematic and random errors. The assessments were carried out a region around the crack tip, where high strain gradients and inhomogeneous deformation present significant challenges for DIC measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crack", "DIC", "error analysis", "steel", "welding"], "IndexKeywords": ["D. digital image correlation (DIC)", "High strains", "Inhomogeneous deformation", "Loading condition", "Measurement uncertainty", "Parametric study", "Welded steels", "Zero load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050890396", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57200328573": {"Name": "Wigger T.", "AuthorID": "57200328573", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "37034532500": {"Name": "Lupton C.", "AuthorID": "37034532500", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}, "7202724363": {"Name": "Tong J.", "AuthorID": "7202724363", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Behaviour of Materials Laboratory, School of Engineering, University of Portsmouth"}}}
