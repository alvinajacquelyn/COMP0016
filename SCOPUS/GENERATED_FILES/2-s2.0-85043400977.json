Methods: This study involved 53 retrieved TKA implants with pre-revision 3D-CT scans used to determine coronal (varus\u2013valgus), sagittal (tibial slope) and rotational (internal rotation\u2013external rotation) TKA orientation as well as tibiofemoral leg axis. Differences between femoral and tibial angles to describe the \"relative rotational mismatch\" were also calculated. All tibial inserts were forensically analyzed using the Hood score. Statistical analysis was performed to investigate correlations between TKA component orientation and surface damage (p < 0.05). Results: Femoral components were found to have axial rotations mainly within \u00b1 3\u00b0 (68%), whilst 45% of the tibial components and 66% of the relative rotational mismatches were > 3\u00b0 and < \u2212 3\u00b0, respectively. The majority of femoral and tibial components (87% in both cases), as well as the femorotibial angle (70%), showed coronal orientations within \u00b1 3\u00b0. The 64% of the tibial components showed posterior tibial slopes out of both the 0\u00b0\u20133\u00b0 and 5\u00b0\u20137\u00b0 ranges. There was a significant correlation between tibial slope and damage score on polyethylene tibial inserts (r = 0.2856; p = 0.0382) as well as a significant correlation between implants\u2019 position in the axial plane and damage score on polyethylene tibial inserts (r = 0.6537, p = 0.0240). Conclusions: This is the first study to use accurate measurements from pre-revision 3DCT to compare tibial and femoral orientation in all three planes with retrieval findings in total knee replacements. A significant correlation between implant position and polyethylene surface damage was found. These results showed the importance of optimizing component position to minimize polyethylene damage. Further analysis involving more accurate polyethylene wear measurements are fundamental to fully understand the role of components\u2019 orientation in TKAs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D computed tomography", "Implant orientation", "Malalignment", "Polyethylene surface damage", "Total knee arthroplasty", "Total knee replacement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Female", "Humans", "Knee Joint", "Knee Prosthesis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prosthesis Failure", "Prosthesis Fitting", "Reoperation", "Rotation", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043400977", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57192315916": {"Name": "Cerquiglini A.", "AuthorID": "57192315916", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57168885800": {"Name": "Rotigliano N.", "AuthorID": "57168885800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Kantonsspital Baselland (Bruderholz, Liestal, Laufen)"}, "17342015000": {"Name": "Hirschmann M.T.", "AuthorID": "17342015000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology, Kantonsspital Baselland (Bruderholz, Liestal, Laufen)"}}}
