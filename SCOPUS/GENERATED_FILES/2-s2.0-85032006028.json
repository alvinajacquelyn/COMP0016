All rights reserved.Clinical effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for preventing HIV acquisition in men who have sex with men (MSM) at high HIV risk is established. A static decision analytical model was constructed to inform policy prioritisation in England around cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of a PrEP programme covering 5,000 MSM during an initial highrisk period. National genitourinary medicine clinic surveillance data informed key HIV risk assumptions. Pragmatic large-scale implementation scenarios were explored. At 86% effectiveness, PrEP given to 5,000 MSM at 3.3 per 100 person-years annual HIV incidence, assuming risk compensation (20% HIV incidence increase), averted 118 HIV infections over remaining lifetimes and was cost saving. Lower effectiveness (64%) gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of + GBP 23,500 (EUR 32,000) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Investment of GBP 26.9 million (EUR 36.6 million) in year-1 breaks even anywhere from year-23 (86% effectiveness) to year-33 (64% effectiveness). PrEP cost-effectiveness was highly sensitive to year-1 HIV incidence, PrEP adherence/ effectiveness, and antiretroviral drug costs. There is much uncertainty around HIV incidence in those given PrEP and adherence/effectiveness, especially under programme scale-up. Substantially reduced PrEP drug costs are needed to give the necessary assurance of cost-effectiveness, and for an affordable public health programme of sufficient size.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Delivery of Health Care", "England", "Health Care Costs", "HIV Infections", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Risk", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032006028", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"57044173800": {"Name": "Ong K.J.", "AuthorID": "57044173800", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV & STI Department, National Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "26427608100": {"Name": "Desai S.", "AuthorID": "26427608100", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV & STI Department, National Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "26667658700": {"Name": "Desai M.", "AuthorID": "26667658700", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV & STI Department, National Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "7004496822": {"Name": "Nardone A.", "AuthorID": "7004496822", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV & STI Department, National Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "55712560900": {"Name": "Gill O.N.", "AuthorID": "55712560900", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV & STI Department, National Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control (CIDSC), Public Health England"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection & Population Health, University College London"}, "24554371200": {"Name": "van Hoek A.J.", "AuthorID": "24554371200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}}}
