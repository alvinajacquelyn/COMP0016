We analyzed the relationships between attitudes and age, gender, education, occupation, years at residence, income, distance from protected area, livestock owned, livestock lost to predators and knowledge of carnivores. Three-quarters of respondents (79%) held negative attitudes toward large carnivores, while 20% were generally positive. Three variables were positively associated with attitudes towards different species: formal education (all carnivore species), years at residence (lions and cheetahs), and knowledge of carnivores (cheetahs). Attitudes toward large carnivores were not significantly related to distance from protected area, livestock owned. or livestock lost to predators. Findings suggested that interventions aimed at fostering positive attitudes toward large carnivores should focus on improving formal education and securing long-term residency for people in the region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attitudes", "large carnivores", "local people", "perceptions", "Tarangire National Park"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019087612", "SubjectAreas": [["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57194191921": {"Name": "Mkonyi F.", "AuthorID": "57194191921", "AffiliationID": "60071577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Dar es Salaam University College of Education"}, "13104284000": {"Name": "Estes A.", "AuthorID": "13104284000", "AffiliationID": "60103339, 60001439", "AffiliationName": "The Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences, Pennsylvania State University"}, "36081220600": {"Name": "Msuha M.", "AuthorID": "36081220600", "AffiliationID": "60071598", "AffiliationName": "Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute"}, "55310466600": {"Name": "Lichtenfeld L.", "AuthorID": "55310466600", "AffiliationID": "118489220", "AffiliationName": "Tanzania People & Wildlife Fund"}, "7003589897": {"Name": "Durant S.", "AuthorID": "7003589897", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}}}
