The difficulty of this task is increased because clinical high-risk symptoms are frequently nonspecific to psychosis. Objective: To determine whether the consultation patterns for a prespecified set of symptoms can be used to identify primary care patients who later developed a psychotic illness. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested case-control study used primary care consultation data collected from 530 primary care practices in 13 UK regions from January 1, 2000, through September 30, 2009. Participants included 11\u202f690 adults with a diagnosis of psychosis and 81\u202f793 control participants who did not have a diagnosis of psychosis individually matched by age group, sex, and primary care practice. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2015, through June 2, 2017. Exposures: Prespecified symptoms selected from literature included attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-like symptoms, bizarre behavior, blunted affect, problems associated with cannabis, depressive symptoms, role functioning problems, social isolation, symptoms of mania, obsessive-compulsive disorder-like symptoms, disordered personal hygiene, sleep disturbance, problems associated with cigarette smoking, and suicidal behavior (including self-harm). Main Outcomes and Measures: Case (diagnosis of psychosis) or control (no diagnosis of psychosis) status. Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the association between symptoms and case-control status in the 5 years before diagnosis. Positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated using the Bayes theorem for symptoms stratified by age group and sex. Repeated-measures Poisson regression was used to investigate symptom consultation rate. Results: Of the total sample of 93\u202f483 participants, 57.4% were female and 40.0% were older than 60 years (mean [SD] age, 51.34 [21.75] years). Twelve symptoms were associated with a later psychotic diagnosis (all prespecified symptoms except disordered personal hygiene). The strongest association was with suicidal behavior (odds ratio [OR], 19.06; 95% CI, 16.55-21.95). Positive predictive values were heterogeneous across age and sex. The highest PPVs were for suicidal behavior (33.0% in men 24 years or younger [95% CI, 24.2%-43.2%] and 19.6% in women aged 25-34 years [95% CI, 13.7%-27.2%]). Pairs of symptoms were associated with an increase in PPV. Consultation rates were higher in cases and increased 3 months before diagnosis. Conclusions and Relevance: Most of the preselected nonspecific symptoms were associated with a later psychotic diagnosis, particularly among young men consulting for suicidal behavior, especially if consulting with increasing frequency. These symptoms should alert physicians to patients who may benefit from a further assessment of psychotic symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Case-Control Studies", "Early Diagnosis", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Primary Health Care", "Psychotic Disorders", "Referral and Consultation", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062228331", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"24069481600": {"Name": "Sullivan S.A.", "AuthorID": "24069481600", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60170515, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care West, University Hospitals Bristol National Health Service Foundation Trust, University of Bristol"}, "7004134399": {"Name": "Tilling K.", "AuthorID": "7004134399", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "26030614800": {"Name": "Redaniel T.", "AuthorID": "26030614800", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60170515, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care West, University Hospitals Bristol National Health Service Foundation Trust, University of Bristol"}, "57215679350": {"Name": "Hamilton W.", "AuthorID": "57215679350", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "57219440799": {"Name": "Moran P.", "AuthorID": "57219440799", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, University of Bristol"}, "7402636448": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
