China has entered a new phase of economic development \u2013 \u201cNew Normal\u201d \u2013 in which large-scale and multidimensional changes are occurring in the economic structure. This study aims to estimate the carbon implications of these changes in the economic structure at the city level. We compiled a multiregional input-output (MRIO) model for China and used an environmentally extended input-output analysis (EEIOA) to estimate CO2 emissions in Shanghai from both production and consumption perspectives. We found that consumption-based CO2 emissions were more than 30% higher than production-based emissions in Shanghai. In recent years, both production- and consumption-based CO2 emissions in Shanghai declined because of changes in China's economic development mode. The production-based emissions declined mainly due to changes in the production structure and energy mix, while the consumption-based emissions declined mainly due to changes in consumption patterns and domestic interregional emission flows.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon emissions", "Consumption patterns", "Economic structure", "Input-output model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047486257", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57202219344": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57202219344", "AffiliationID": "60021200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics, East China Normal University"}, "35207058700": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "35207058700", "AffiliationID": "120017742", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Institute of Eco-Chongming (SIEC)"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "57212727144": {"Name": "Ma Z.", "AuthorID": "57212727144", "AffiliationID": "60014402", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Resources and Environment, Renmin University of China"}}}
