To investigate the effects of the built-in-dot charge on recombination processes and device performance InAs/GaAs quantum dot IBSCs with direct Si doping in the quantum dots are fabricated, and the I-V characteristics and transients of the open circuit voltage and short circuit current are measured. The decay times of both the open circuit voltage and the short circuit current increase as the concentration of n-type doping increases in the quantum dots. The observed increase in the charge carrier lifetime is attributed to suppressed recombination of electron-hole pairs through the states of quantum dots and shrinking the depletion layer. This is supported by measurements of both photovoltage and photoluminescence spectra.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carrier lifetime", "IIIV semiconductors", "quantum dots", "recombination processes", "solar cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Device performance", "Electron hole pairs", "Intermediate-band solar cells", "IV characteristics", "Photoluminescence spectrum", "Quantum dot solar cells", "Recombination process", "Selective doping"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018496650", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"14019747400": {"Name": "Kondratenko S.", "AuthorID": "14019747400", "AffiliationID": "60023137", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv"}, "56768988100": {"Name": "Yakovliev A.", "AuthorID": "56768988100", "AffiliationID": "60023137", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv"}, "57190737411": {"Name": "Iliash S.", "AuthorID": "57190737411", "AffiliationID": "60023137", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv"}, "7005644077": {"Name": "Mazur Y.", "AuthorID": "7005644077", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "7005356675": {"Name": "Ware M.", "AuthorID": "7005356675", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "7004309232": {"Name": "Salamo G.", "AuthorID": "7004309232", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "55672258000": {"Name": "Lam P.", "AuthorID": "55672258000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
