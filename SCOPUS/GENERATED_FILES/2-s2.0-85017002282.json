Light chain cardiac amyloidosis, in particular, if recognized early and treated with targeted plasma cell therapy, can be managed very effectively. For patients with transthyretin amyloidosis, there are numerous therapies that are currently in late-phase clinical trials. In this review, we address common questions encountered in clinical practice regarding etiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of cardiac amyloidosis, focusing on recent important developments in cardiac imaging and biochemical diagnosis. The aim is to show how a systematic approach to the evaluation of suspected cardiac amyloidosis can impact the prognosis of patients in the modern era.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloidosis", "cardiomyopathies", "echocardiography", "heart failure, diastolic", "immunoglobulin light chains", "magnetic resonance imaging", "prealbumin", "radionuclide imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyloidosis", "Cardiomyopathies", "Humans", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017002282", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"35515053700": {"Name": "Maurer M.", "AuthorID": "35515053700", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60018043", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University Medical Center, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Clinical Cardiovascular Research Laboratory for the Elderly"}, "7202244843": {"Name": "Elliott P.", "AuthorID": "7202244843", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60004093", "AffiliationName": "University College London, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57210215620": {"Name": "Comenzo R.", "AuthorID": "57210215620", "AffiliationID": "60001344", "AffiliationName": "Tufts Medical Center"}, "7003770845": {"Name": "Semigran M.", "AuthorID": "7003770845", "AffiliationID": "60009982, 60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard University"}, "7005883289": {"Name": "Rapezzi C.", "AuthorID": "7005883289", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna"}}}
