As oxygen is a key substrate for Photo-/Sono-dynamic Therapy (PDT/SDT), hypoxia is also problematic for the treatment of solid tumours using these techniques. The ability to deliver oxygen to the vicinity of the tumour increases its local partial pressure improving the possibility of ROS generation in PDT/SDT. In this manuscript, we investigate the use of oxygen-loaded, lipid-stabilised microbubbles (MBs), decorated with a Rose Bengal sensitiser, for SDT-based treatment of a pancreatic cancer model (BxPc-3) in vitro and in vivo. We directly compare the effectiveness of the oxygen-loaded MBs with sulphur hexafluoride (SF<inf>6</inf>)-loaded MBs and reveal a significant improvement in therapeutic efficacy. The combination of oxygen-carrying, ultrasound-responsive MBs, with an ultrasound-responsive therapeutic sensitiser, offers the possibility of delivering and activating the MB-sensitiser conjugate at the tumour site in a non-invasive manner, providing enhanced sonodynamic activation at that site.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bengal", "Cancer", "Hypoxia", "Microbubbles", "Pancreatic", "Rose", "SDT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bengal", "Cancer", "Hypoxia", "Microbubbles", "Pancreatic", "Rose", "SDT", "Animals", "Anoxia", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Humans", "Male", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Microbubbles", "Oxygen", "Pancreas", "Pancreatic Neoplasms", "Photochemotherapy", "Photosensitizing Agents", "Rose Bengal", "Tumor Cells, Cultured", "Ultrasonic Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923241095", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"56450503100": {"Name": "McEwan C.", "AuthorID": "56450503100", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "51665005200": {"Name": "Fowley C.", "AuthorID": "51665005200", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "55482870000": {"Name": "Nesbitt H.", "AuthorID": "55482870000", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "56524149000": {"Name": "Cochrane D.", "AuthorID": "56524149000", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "7007102532": {"Name": "McHale A.P.", "AuthorID": "7007102532", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "7007084127": {"Name": "Callan J.F.", "AuthorID": "7007084127", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, University of Ulster"}, "55229762500": {"Name": "Owen J.", "AuthorID": "55229762500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "8782679600": {"Name": "Stride E.", "AuthorID": "8782679600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "34978326300": {"Name": "Coussios C.C.", "AuthorID": "34978326300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford"}, "57203646013": {"Name": "Borden M.", "AuthorID": "57203646013", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Colorado"}, "14071677100": {"Name": "Nomikou N.", "AuthorID": "14071677100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Medical School, University College London"}}}
