The Drosophila I\u03baB kinase \u03b3 (IKK\u03b3) Kenny is a central regulator of the Drosophila Imd pathway responsible for activation of the NF-\u03baB Relish. We found the Drosophila E3 ligase and HOIL-1L interacting protein (HOIP) orthologue linear ubiquitin E3 ligase (LUBEL) to catalyse formation of M1-linked linear ubiquitin (M1-Ub) chains in flies in a signal-dependent manner upon bacterial infection. Upon activation of the Imd pathway, LUBEL modifies Kenny with M1-Ub chains. Interestingly, the LUBEL-mediated M1-Ub chains seem to be targeted both directly to Kenny and to K63-linked ubiquitin chains conjugated to Kenny by DIAP2. This suggests that DIAP2 and LUBEL work together to promote Kenny-mediated activation of Relish. We found LUBEL-mediated M1-Ub chain formation to be required for flies to survive oral infection with Gram-negative bacteria, for activation of Relish-mediated expression of antimicrobial peptide genes and for pathogen clearance during oral infection. Interestingly, LUBEL is not required for mounting an immune response against systemic infection, as Relish-mediated antimicrobial peptide genes can be expressed in the absence of LUBEL during septic injury. Finally, transgenic induction of LUBEL-mediated M1-Ub drives expression of antimicrobial peptide genes and hyperplasia in the midgut in the absence of infection. This suggests that M1-Ub chains are important for Imd signalling and immune responses in the intestinal epithelia, and that enhanced M1-Ub chain formation is able to drive chronic intestinal inflammation in flies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bacterial Infections", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Inflammation", "Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins", "Mouth", "NF-kappa B", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors", "Ubiquitin", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases", "Ubiquitination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050301331", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57203017562": {"Name": "Aalto A.L.", "AuthorID": "57203017562", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science and Engineering, BioCity, \u00c5bo Akademi University"}, "55439910900": {"Name": "Mohan A.K.", "AuthorID": "55439910900", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science and Engineering, BioCity, \u00c5bo Akademi University"}, "57203019895": {"Name": "Kietz C.", "AuthorID": "57203019895", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science and Engineering, BioCity, \u00c5bo Akademi University"}, "8097253200": {"Name": "Meinander A.", "AuthorID": "8097253200", "AffiliationID": "60015375", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science and Engineering, BioCity, \u00c5bo Akademi University"}, "35103422100": {"Name": "Schwintzer L.", "AuthorID": "35103422100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "6506358830": {"Name": "Broemer M.", "AuthorID": "6506358830", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "57189463511": {"Name": "Kupka S.", "AuthorID": "57189463511", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7003995251": {"Name": "Walczak H.", "AuthorID": "7003995251", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
