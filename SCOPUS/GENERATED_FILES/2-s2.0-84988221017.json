The base and top of the Banast\u00f3n System are defined by angular unconformities; the margins show pinch-out onto hemipelagic slope mudstones or sidelap onto canyon walls. The Banast\u00f3n System comprises six lower-slope erosional channel/canyon fills with an ~. 520. m cumulative thickness that correlate with six linked proximal basin-floor, laterally offset-stacked low-sinuosity, coarse-grained, channel-lev\u00e9e-overbank complexes (BI-BVI) totalling ~. 700. m cumulative thickness in the lower slope setting. The younger Banast\u00f3n IV, V and VI sandbodies (BIV-VI) show less confinement and overspill the more aerially restricted older parts of the Banast\u00f3n System. About 3. km farther NW into the Ainsa Basin, the BI-VI sandbodies are less confined, and laterally offset-stacked towards the WSW in increments of ~. 1. km; they are interpreted as channel-lev\u00e9e-overbank complexes in a proximal basin-floor setting. The base of each complex is defined by a MTD/MTC comprising coarse-grained deposits and characterised by pebbly mudstones. The Banast\u00f3n System is an example of a deep-marine, sand-prone, lower-slope and proximal basin-floor transition that shows the importance of the interplay between depositional control on sand accumulation (e.g., MTDs/MTCs), erosional confinement within lower-slope channels, a tectonically-driven mobile slope and syn-sedimentary seafloor growth structures, in controlling the lateral migration of channels away from the deformation front. We document these 3-D relationships and discuss the transport, deposition and tectonic processes responsible for the thickest turbidite sandstone accumulation in the Ainsa Basin.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep-marine", "Eocene", "Submarine channels", "Syn-sedimentary tectonics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988221017", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"34972829400": {"Name": "Bayliss N.", "AuthorID": "34972829400", "AffiliationID": "60021814", "AffiliationName": "ExxonMobil Production Company"}, "7005054236": {"Name": "Pickering K.T.", "AuthorID": "7005054236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, UCL (University College London)"}}}
