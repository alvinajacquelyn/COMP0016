The Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study is a randomized international clinical trial that compares immediate with deferred initiation of ART for HIV-positive individuals with CD4 cell counts above 500cells/\u03bcL. We describe the demographics, HIV-specific characteristics and medical history of this cohort. Methods: Data collected at baseline include demographics, HIV-specific laboratory values, prior medical diagnoses and concomitant medications. Baseline characteristics were compared by geographical region, gender and age. Results: START enrolled 4685 HIV-positive participants from 215 sites in 35 countries. The median age is 36 years [interquartile range (IQR) 29-44 years], 27% are female, and 45% self-identify as white, 30% as black, 14% as Latino/Hispanic, 8% as Asian and 3% as other. The route of HIV acquisition is reported as men who have sex with men in 55% of participants, heterosexual sex in 38%, injecting drug use in 1% and other/unknown in 5%. Median time since HIV diagnosis is 1.0 year (IQR 0.4-3.0 years) and the median CD4 cell count and HIV RNA values at study entry are 651cells/\u03bcL (IQR 584-765cells/\u03bcL) and 12754 HIV RNA copies/mL (IQR 3014-43607 copies/mL), respectively. Conclusions: START has enrolled a diverse group of ART-na\u00efve individuals with high CD4 cell counts who are comparable to the HIV-positive population from the regions in which they were enrolled. The information collected with this robust study design will provide a database with which to evaluate the risks and benefits of early ART use for many important outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trial", "HIV", "START trial", "When to start antiretroviral therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Cohort Studies", "Demography", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923344486", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55356235300": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "55356235300", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "7006720136": {"Name": "Neaton J.", "AuthorID": "7006720136", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "57200797852": {"Name": "Babiker A.", "AuthorID": "57200797852", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "57188785246": {"Name": "Emery S.", "AuthorID": "57188785246", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "The Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "7005387174": {"Name": "Gordin F.", "AuthorID": "7005387174", "AffiliationID": "60020147, 60003088", "AffiliationName": "Washington DC Veterans Affairs Medical Center and George Washington University"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen HIV Programme, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "6506711431": {"Name": "Bakowska E.", "AuthorID": "6506711431", "AffiliationID": "106323921", "AffiliationName": "Wojewodzki Szpital Zakazny"}, "7201943467": {"Name": "Schechter M.", "AuthorID": "7201943467", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Projeto Pra\u00e7a Onze, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"}, "7004831677": {"Name": "Wiselka M.", "AuthorID": "7004831677", "AffiliationID": "60007974, 60028485", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester Royal Infirmary"}, "56526091000": {"Name": "Wolff M.", "AuthorID": "56526091000", "AffiliationID": "60002946", "AffiliationName": "University of Chile School of Medicine, Fundacion Arriaran"}}}
