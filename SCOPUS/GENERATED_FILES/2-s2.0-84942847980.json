Numerous potentially chemotherapeutic compounds are developed every year for clinical trial and some of them are considered as potential drug candidates. Nanotechnology-based approaches have accelerated the discovery process, but the key challenge still remains to develop therapeutically viable and physiologically safe materials suitable for cancer therapy. Here, we report a high turnover, on/off-switchable functionally popping reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator using a smart mesoporous titanium dioxide popcorn (TiO<inf>2</inf> Pops) nanoarchitecture. The resulting TiO<inf>2</inf> Pops, unlike TiO<inf>2</inf> nanoparticles (TiO<inf>2</inf> NPs), are exceptionally biocompatible with normal cells. Under identical conditions, TiO<inf>2</inf> Pops show very high photocatalytic activity compared to TiO<inf>2</inf> NPs. Upon on/off-switchable photo activation, the TiO<inf>2</inf> Pops can trigger the generation of high-turnover flash ROS and can deliver their potential anticancer effect by enhancing the intracellular ROS level until it crosses the threshold to open the 'death gate', thus reducing the survival of cancer cells by at least six times in comparison with TiO<inf>2</inf> NPs without affecting the normal cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Cell Line", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Fibroblasts", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Light", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Organ Specificity", "Oxidative Stress", "Photochemical Processes", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Titanium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942847980", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14067825400": {"Name": "Patra H.", "AuthorID": "14067825400", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cell Biology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKE), Link\u00f6ping University"}, "55509216700": {"Name": "Imani R.", "AuthorID": "55509216700", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Biophysics, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Ljubljana"}, "35563169900": {"Name": "Turner A.", "AuthorID": "35563169900", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Biosensors and Bioelectronics Centre, IFM, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "55568510565": {"Name": "Tiwari A.", "AuthorID": "55568510565", "AffiliationID": "115777021", "AffiliationName": "Tekidag AB, Mj\u00e4rdevi Science Park"}, "36082582000": {"Name": "Jangamreddy J.", "AuthorID": "36082582000", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cell Biology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine (IKE), Link\u00f6ping University"}, "6505537673": {"Name": "Igli\u00e8 A.", "AuthorID": "6505537673", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biophysics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of Ljubljana"}, "52364747000": {"Name": "Pazoki M.", "AuthorID": "52364747000", "AffiliationID": "60023238, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m Laboratory, Uppsala University"}}}
