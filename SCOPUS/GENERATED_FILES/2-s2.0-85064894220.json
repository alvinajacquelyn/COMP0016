A cross-sectional survey was carried out including patients diagnosed with migraine attending 12 Spanish Headache Units. We determined diagnosis of PD administering a validated self-reported questionnaire. Socio-demographic, clinical and medical information, comorbidities, daily habits, migraine characteristics and medication were collected using a questionnaire. Of the 651 consecutive migraineurs included in the study, 393 suffered from chronic migraine (CM). Self-reported PD was detected in 327 patients with migraine (50.2%). Migraineurs with self-reported PD were significantly older and had a previous history of fibromyalgia, stress, anxiety, depression, and allodynia (all P < 0.001). Additionally, this group of patients consumed more topiramate (P = 0.008) and simple analgesics (P < 0.001) than patients with migraine and without self-reported PD. Also, they were less active physically and belonged to a low education level (both P < 0.001). Prevalence of self-reported PD was significantly higher in chronic migraineurs compared to those diagnosed with episodic migraine (EM) (53.9% vs. 44.6%, P = 0.019). Logistic regression analyses showed that self-reported PD was associated with CM (OR 1.456; 95% CI 1.062\u20131.997, P = 0.020). However, after adjusting for significant confounders, the association was attenuated (OR 1.100; 95% CI 0.784\u20131.543, P = 0.581). We concluded that self-reported PD was significantly more frequent in CM compared to EM. Self-reported PD was associated with the presence of CM, although some comorbidities shared by both diseases could have an effect on this association.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic migraine", "Epidemiology", "Headache", "Periodontitis", "Prevalence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "Humans", "Migraine Disorders", "Periodontitis", "Self Report", "Spain", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064894220", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"56707470700": {"Name": "Leira Y.", "AuthorID": "56707470700", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of Santiago de Compostela, Medical-Surgical Dentistry (OMEQUI) Research Group, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "56375663600": {"Name": "Orlandi M.", "AuthorID": "56375663600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute and Hospital, University College London"}, "57198744550": {"Name": "D\u2019Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "57198744550", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute and Hospital, University College London"}, "57061663300": {"Name": "Blanco J.", "AuthorID": "57061663300", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of Santiago de Compostela, Medical-Surgical Dentistry (OMEQUI) Research Group, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "6506448221": {"Name": "Pozo-Rosich P.", "AuthorID": "6506448221", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60108505", "AffiliationName": "Headache Research Group, Vall d\u2019Hebron Institute of Research (VHIR), Universitat Aut\u00f3noma de Barcelona"}, "55884171400": {"Name": "Torres-Ferr\u00fas M.", "AuthorID": "55884171400", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60108505", "AffiliationName": "Headache Research Group, Vall d\u2019Hebron Institute of Research (VHIR), Universitat Aut\u00f3noma de Barcelona"}, "7004396687": {"Name": "L\u00e1inez J.M.", "AuthorID": "7004396687", "AffiliationID": "60015415, 60105170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario, Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valencia"}, "6701625178": {"Name": "\u00c1lvaro L.C.", "AuthorID": "6701625178", "AffiliationID": "60015927, 60027856", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Basurto, Universidad del Pa\u00eds Vasco/Euskal Herriko Unibertsitatea EHU/UPV"}, "7003371150": {"Name": "Monz\u00f3n M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003371150", "AffiliationID": "60022336", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet"}, "57211975156": {"Name": "Guerrero \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "57211975156", "AffiliationID": "60020340", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario de Valladolid"}, "55981553300": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Azor\u00edn D.", "AuthorID": "55981553300", "AffiliationID": "60020340", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario de Valladolid"}, "6602570500": {"Name": "Belv\u00eds R.", "AuthorID": "6602570500", "AffiliationID": "60009466", "AffiliationName": "Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau"}, "25723080000": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Oria C.", "AuthorID": "25723080000", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Virgen del Roc\u00edo"}, "57185796700": {"Name": "Gago-Veiga A.B.", "AuthorID": "57185796700", "AffiliationID": "60024257", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario La Princesa"}, "36628823800": {"Name": "Latorre G.", "AuthorID": "36628823800", "AffiliationID": "60021046", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario de Fuenlabrada"}, "7102756249": {"Name": "Santos S.", "AuthorID": "7102756249", "AffiliationID": "60033448", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario Lozano Blesa"}, "7005349795": {"Name": "Cuadrado M.L.", "AuthorID": "7005349795", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60032461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Headache Unit, Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, San Carlos Institute for Health Research (IdISSC), Complutense University of Madrid"}, "7005680825": {"Name": "Leira R.", "AuthorID": "7005680825", "AffiliationID": "60002983, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Headache Unit, Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario, University of Santiago de Compostela, Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}}}
