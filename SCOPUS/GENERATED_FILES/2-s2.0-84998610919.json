Not all users of an anony- mous communication system will be online at the same time, this leaks some information about who is talking to who. A global passive adversary observing all communications can learn the set of potential recipients of a message with more and more confidence over time. Nearly all deployed anony- mous communication tools offer no protection against such attacks. In this work, we introduce TASP, a protocol used by an anonymous communication system that mitigates inter- section attacks by intelligently grouping clients together into anonymity sets. We find that with a bandwidth overhead of just 8% we can dramatically extend the time necessary to perform a successful intersection attack.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anonymity sets", "Anonymous communication systems", "Bandwidth overheads", "Communication tools", "Intersection attacks", "nocv1", "Passive adversary"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998610919", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57192153560": {"Name": "Hayes J.", "AuthorID": "57192153560", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57200734488": {"Name": "Danezis G.", "AuthorID": "57200734488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "23398216400": {"Name": "Troncoso C.", "AuthorID": "23398216400", "AffiliationID": "60121727", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Software Institute"}}}
