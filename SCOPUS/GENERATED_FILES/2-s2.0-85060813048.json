On one hand, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) could leverage DERs capabilities to provide ancillary services such as voltage support, frequency response, or reserves deployment. On the other hand, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) could use DER services to avoid congestion in distribution networks and defer reinforcement costs. This study discusses the paradigm of DSOs having priority in the provision of services over the TSO in a local services market. When a DSO procures services in a local market close to real time, coordination issues with TSO can be expected. This paper assesses the conflict cost of two possible market schemes: in the first one only TSO can access DER flexibility, whereas in the second case DSOs lead the TSOs in the procurement of DER flexibility. A novel set of metrics based of conflict pricing has been defined and evaluated in area in the UK, where a significant increase of distributed generation is planned.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Distribution network", "DSO-TSO coordination", "Local market"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ancillary service", "Distributed Energy Resources", "Distribution systems", "DSO-TSO coordination", "Local markets", "System operation", "Transmission system operators", "Voltage support"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060813048", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Nuclear Energy and Engineering", "ENER", "2104"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57205611219": {"Name": "Pastor A.", "AuthorID": "57205611219", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Power Engineering Centre, Cranfield University"}, "57190516605": {"Name": "Nieto-Martin J.", "AuthorID": "57190516605", "AffiliationID": "60010057", "AffiliationName": "Management Science and Operations London Business School"}, "7007068246": {"Name": "Bunn D.", "AuthorID": "7007068246", "AffiliationID": "60010057", "AffiliationName": "Management Science and Operations London Business School"}, "15081806200": {"Name": "Varga L.", "AuthorID": "15081806200", "AffiliationID": "60116362", "AffiliationName": "Infrastructure Systems Group, Cranfield School of Management"}}}
