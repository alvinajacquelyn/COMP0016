As obesity is linked to an inflammatory component, the aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of broccoli sprouts in overweight adult subjects. Methods: An in vivo controlled study was performed in 40 healthy overweight subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT 03390855). Treatment phase consisted on the consumption of broccoli sprouts (30 g/day) during 10 weeks and the follow-up phase of 10 weeks of normal diet without consumption of these broccoli sprouts. Anthropometric parameters as body fat mass, body weight, and BMI were determined. Inflammation status was assessed by measuring levels of TNF-\u03b1 IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and C-reactive protein. Results: IL-6 levels significantly decreased (mean values from 4.76 pg/mL to 2.11 pg/mL with 70 days of broccoli consumption, p < 0.001) and during control phase the inflammatory levels were maintained at low grade (mean values from 1.20 pg/mL to 2.66 pg/mL, p < 0.001). C-reactive protein significantly decreased as well. Conclusions: This study represents an advance in intervention studies as the broccoli sprouts were included in a daily dietary pattern in quantities that reflect a real consumption. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the role of this healthy rich and nutritious food product, but these promising results support the current evidence on the healthy properties of Brassica varieties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioavailability", "Brassica oleracea", "Glucosinolates", "IL-6", "Inflammation", "Sulforaphane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Brassica", "Cytokines", "Diet", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glucosinolates", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Isothiocyanates", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Overweight", "Vegetables"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044297882", "SubjectAreas": [["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57201311537": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Chill\u00f3n M.T.", "AuthorID": "57201311537", "AffiliationID": "60109394", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Cat\u00f3lica San Antonio de Murcia (UCAM), Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Campus de los Jer\u00f3nimos"}, "6602429921": {"Name": "Zafrilla P.", "AuthorID": "6602429921", "AffiliationID": "60109394", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Cat\u00f3lica San Antonio de Murcia (UCAM), Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Campus de los Jer\u00f3nimos"}, "8947716500": {"Name": "Villa\u00f1o D.", "AuthorID": "8947716500", "AffiliationID": "60109394", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Cat\u00f3lica San Antonio de Murcia (UCAM), Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Health Sciences, Campus de los Jer\u00f3nimos"}, "57201325904": {"Name": "Carazo-D\u00edaz C.", "AuthorID": "57201325904", "AffiliationID": "60109394", "AffiliationName": "Applied Statistical Methods in Medical Research Group, Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM)"}, "24478918700": {"Name": "Prieto-Merino D.", "AuthorID": "24478918700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "56526352700": {"Name": "Moreno D.A.", "AuthorID": "56526352700", "AffiliationID": "60002240", "AffiliationName": "CEBAS-CSIC, Department of Food Science and Technology, Phytochemistry and Healthy Foods Lab.
