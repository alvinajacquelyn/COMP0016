One particular find has been controversially discussed as the potentially earliest known example of copper smelting in western Eurasia, a copper \u2018slag\u2019 piece from the Late Neolithic to Chalcolithic site of Catal-hoyuk in central Turkey. Here we present a new assessment of metal making at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck based on the re-analysis of minerals, mineral artefacts and high-temperature materials excavated in the 1960s by J. Mellaart and first analysed by Neuninger, Pittioni and Siegl in 1964. This paper focuses on copper-based minerals, the alleged piece of metallurgical slag, and copper metal beads, and their contextual relationship to each other. It is based on new microstructural, compositional and isotopic analyses, and a careful re-examination of the fieldwork documentation and analytical data related to the c. 8500 years old high-temperature debris at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck. We re-interpret the sample identified earlier as metallurgical slag as incidentally fired green pigment, which was originally deposited in a burial and later affected by a destructive fire that also charred the bones of the interred body. We also re-confirm the contemporary metal beads as made from native metal. Our results provide a new and conclusive explanation of the previously contentious find, and reposition \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck in a new narrative of the multiple origins of metallurgy in the Old World.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anatolia", "Copper minerals", "Metallurgy", "Pigments", "Slag", "\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027418670", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"36169346800": {"Name": "Radivojevi\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "36169346800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60111307, 60104772", "AffiliationName": "College of Humanities and Social Sciences, HBKU"}, "24491655800": {"Name": "Farid S.", "AuthorID": "24491655800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "7003411364": {"Name": "Pernicka E.", "AuthorID": "7003411364", "AffiliationID": "60116334", "AffiliationName": "Curt-Engelhorn-Zentrum Arch\u00e4ometrie"}, "57195353112": {"Name": "Camurcuo\u011flu D.", "AuthorID": "57195353112", "AffiliationID": "60003455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Conservation, The British Museum"}}}
