In response, a broad spectrum of treatment options exist and are provided by a multitude of health care practitioners. The cause and duration of the facial weakness can vary widely and the optimal care pathway varies. To optimize patient outcome, those involved in the care of patients with facial palsy should collaborate within comprehensive multidisciplinary teams (MDTs). At an international level, those involved in the care of patients with facial paralysis should aim to create standardized guidelines on which outcome domains matter most to patients to aid the identification of high quality care. This review summarizes the causes and treatment options for facial paralysis and discusses the subsequent importance of multidisciplinary care in the management of patients with this condition. Further discussion is given to the extended role of the MDT in determining what constitutes quality in facial palsy care to aid the creation of accepted care pathways and delineate best practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Facial palsy", "Multidisciplinary", "Outcome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030237648", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"35789823700": {"Name": "Butler D.P.", "AuthorID": "35789823700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "15851075100": {"Name": "Grobbelaar A.O.", "AuthorID": "15851075100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
