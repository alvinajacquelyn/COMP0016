The aim of this study was to measure and identify the predictors of costs of staff contacts and activities on inpatient wards. Method: Inpatients from psychiatric hospital wards in south London were interviewed in 2008 and 2009 and staff contacts and use of activities recorded over a week and costs calculated. Regression analyses identified predictors. Results: Of 334 participants, 78 % used activities and 90 % had staff contacts. However, 41 % reported no nurse contact. Mean staff contact and activity costs were \u00a3197 and \u00a330 per week, respectively. Staff contact costs were inversely related to age, and activity costs were higher for patients with higher levels of education. Patient satisfaction was positively associated with both costs. Conclusions: The costs of self-reported staff contacts and use of activities account for a small amount of total inpatient costs. Patients with higher costs appeared to have higher levels of satisfaction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Costs", "Economic evaluation", "Inpatient care", "Service use"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Educational Status", "Female", "Health Care Costs", "Hospitalization", "Hospitals, Psychiatric", "Humans", "Inpatients", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Satisfaction", "Professional-Patient Relations", "Qualitative Research", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957942669", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35769768700": {"Name": "Sabes-Figuera R.", "AuthorID": "35769768700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King\u2019s Health Economics, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "7003937597": {"Name": "McCrone P.", "AuthorID": "7003937597", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P024 Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "14021176400": {"Name": "Csipke E.", "AuthorID": "14021176400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "57217833341": {"Name": "Sharma B.", "AuthorID": "57217833341", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "7005058916": {"Name": "Wykes T.", "AuthorID": "7005058916", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "55243134200": {"Name": "Craig T.K.J.", "AuthorID": "55243134200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social Psychiatry, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "7401709690": {"Name": "Rose D.", "AuthorID": "7401709690", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Service User Research Enterprise, Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}}}
