There remains a need for satisfactory integrated sensors that can monitor humidity inside small active implanted devices in which delicate electronics are operating. This paper describes a simple capacitance-to-digits readout circuit for a capacitive humidity sensor for ultra-small medical implants. The proposed readout circuit provides a larger dynamic range than conventional capacitance readout circuits by removing the parasitic capacitance from the measured capacitive input. The circuit was designed in XFAB's 0.6-\u03bcm CMOS technology and provides 1 % resolution in measuring relative humidity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capacitance-to-digits readout circuit", "capacitance-to-time converter", "hermeticity", "humidity sensor", "implant package"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capacitive humidity sensors", "Hermeticity", "Implanted device", "Integrated humidity sensor", "Integrated sensors", "Medical implants", "Parasitic capacitance", "Read-out circuit"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057085532", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57204777817": {"Name": "Wen Y.", "AuthorID": "57204777817", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "57203648980": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57203648980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "15723130500": {"Name": "Donaldson N.", "AuthorID": "15723130500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}}}
