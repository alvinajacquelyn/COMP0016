For technological applications, thin films of WO3 are particularly appealing, taking advantage from a high surface-to-volume ratio and tunable physical properties. However, the growth of stoichiometric crystalline thin films is challenging because the deposition conditions are very sensitive to the formation of oxygen vacancies. In this paper, we show how background oxygen pressure during pulsed laser deposition can be used to tune the structural and electronic properties of WO3 thin films. By performing x-ray diffraction and low-temperature electrical transport measurements, we find changes in the WO3 lattice volume of up to 10% concomitantly with a resistivity drop of more than five orders of magnitude at room temperature as a function of increased oxygen deficiency. We use advanced ab initio calculations to describe in detail the properties of the oxygen vacancy defect states and their evolution in terms of excess charge concentration. Our results depict an intriguing scenario where structural, electronic, optical, and transport properties of WO3 single-crystal thin films can all be purposely tuned by controlling the oxygen vacancy formation during growth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Crystalline thin films", "Electrical transport measurements", "High surface-to-volume ratio", "Oxygen vacancy defects", "Single crystal thin films", "Structural and electronic properties", "Technological applications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059631710", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55220096400": {"Name": "Mattoni G.", "AuthorID": "55220096400", "AffiliationID": "60117987, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology"}, "36773547800": {"Name": "Manca N.", "AuthorID": "36773547800", "AffiliationID": "60117987, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology"}, "25824598100": {"Name": "Caviglia A.D.", "AuthorID": "25824598100", "AffiliationID": "60117987, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology"}, "6701529074": {"Name": "Filippetti A.", "AuthorID": "6701529074", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Cagliari"}, "9036176900": {"Name": "Zubko P.", "AuthorID": "9036176900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
