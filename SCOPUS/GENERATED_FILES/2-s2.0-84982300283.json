Depending on their atmospheric characteristics and precise orbit configurations, it is possible that any of the three planets may be in the liquid water habitable zone, meaning that they may be capable of supporting life. We find that present-day Earth levels of ozone, if present, would be detectable if JWST observes 60 transits for innermost planet 1b and 30 transits for 1c and 1d.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Methods: data analysis", "Planets and satellites: atmospheres", "Radiative transfer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982300283", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55660948300": {"Name": "Barstow J.", "AuthorID": "55660948300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "7101824727": {"Name": "Irwin P.", "AuthorID": "7101824727", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}}}
