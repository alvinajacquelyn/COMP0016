We report a on 6-year-old girl with a de novo 0.63Mb deletion on chromosome 6q25.1 who demonstrated multiple congenital anomalies including a ventricular septal defect and an underdeveloped cerebellar vermis. She presented with severe pre- and post-natal growth failure, hyperextensible small joints (Beighton scores=8/9; with normal parental scores), and an abnormally elastic, redundant skin. Abnormally high upper/lower segment ratio (i.e., 1.34=>3SD), mild dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay were also present. The girl's phenotype was compared with: (i) two girls, each previously reported by Bisgaard et al. and Caselli et al. with similar albeit larger (2.6-7.21Mb) deletions; (ii) seven additional individuals (6M; 1F) harboring deletions within the 6q25.1 region reported in the literature; and (iii) ten further patients (5M; 4F; 1 unrecorded sex) recorded in the DECIPHER 6.0 database. We reported on the present girl as her findings could contribute to advance the phenotype of 6q deletions. In addition, the present deletion is the smallest so far recorded in the 6q25 region encompassing eight known genes [vs. 41 of Bisgaard et al., and 23 of Caselli et al.,], including the TAB2 (likely responsible for the girl's congenital heart defect), LATS1 gene, and the UST gene (a regulator of the homeostasis of proteoglycans, which could have played a role in the abnormal dermal and cartilage elasticity).", "AuthorKeywords": ["6q deletion", "6q25 syndrome", "Arrhythmia", "Cerebellar hypoplasia", "Congenital heart defect", "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome", "Growth retardation", "IUGR", "LATS1", "TAB2", "UST"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abnormalities, Multiple", "Cerebellar Vermis", "Child", "Chromosome Deletion", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6", "Developmental Disabilities", "Elasticity", "Female", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Humans", "Joint Instability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939427105", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6507973880": {"Name": "Salpietro V.", "AuthorID": "6507973880", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Genetics and Paediatric Immunology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "37081050600": {"Name": "Loddo I.", "AuthorID": "37081050600", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Genetics and Paediatric Immunology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "56572822900": {"Name": "Moschella E.", "AuthorID": "56572822900", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Genetics and Paediatric Immunology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "55238749400": {"Name": "Arrigo T.", "AuthorID": "55238749400", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Genetics and Paediatric Immunology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "6602330962": {"Name": "Briuglia S.", "AuthorID": "6602330962", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Genetics and Paediatric Immunology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "15127931100": {"Name": "Ruggieri M.", "AuthorID": "15127931100", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania"}, "24390956300": {"Name": "Mankad K.", "AuthorID": "24390956300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital, Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56462570400": {"Name": "Di Rosa G.", "AuthorID": "56462570400", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Infantile Neuropsychiatry, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "14044928700": {"Name": "Granata F.", "AuthorID": "14044928700", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neuroradiology, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Morpho-Functional Imaging, University of Messina"}, "7005641812": {"Name": "Calabro M.P.", "AuthorID": "7005641812", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Pediatric Cardiology, Department of Paediatrics, University of Messina"}, "23569366100": {"Name": "Capalbo A.", "AuthorID": "23569366100", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Genetics, 'CSS-Mendel' Institute"}, "7003291945": {"Name": "Bernardini L.", "AuthorID": "7003291945", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Genetics, 'CSS-Mendel' Institute"}, "7005749853": {"Name": "Novelli A.", "AuthorID": "7005749853", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, IRCCS"}, "7004306615": {"Name": "Polizzi A.", "AuthorID": "7004306615", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Rare Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0"}, "7004176202": {"Name": "Seidler D.G.", "AuthorID": "7004176202", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Physiological Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University of Munster"}}}
