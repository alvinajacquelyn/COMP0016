Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.Maternal serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCRP) was evaluated in predicting spontaneous abortion in spontaneous pregnancies presenting with threatened spontaneous abortion. Seventy-one cases of threatened spontaneous abortion (group A) and 71 asymptomatic controls (group B), matched for gestational and maternal age, body mass index and smoking status, were included. Maternal serum samples were evaluated for HCG, progesterone, pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and HSCRP using standard bio-assays. No difference was observed in ultrasound measurements, and median progesterone maternal serum level was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in group A compared with group B. In group A, the median of all ultrasound and maternal serum parameters was significantly lower (P < 0.01) compared with group B. The median gestational sac diameter, volume and median HSCRP and PAPP-A levels were significantly increased (P < 0.05) in group A, with a normal outcome compared with group B, probably owing to the inflammatory reaction associated with intrauterine bleeding. In group A patients destined to abortion, the gestational sac development and corresponding protein synthesis fell before the fetal heart activity stopped; in spontaneous pregnancies, maternal serum HSCRP did not provide additional information for the management of threatened spontaneous abortion but warrants further research in assisted reproduction pregnancies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C-reactive protein", "first-trimester", "maternal serum", "miscarriage", "pregnancy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdominal Pain", "Abortion, Spontaneous", "Adult", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cohort Studies", "Down-Regulation", "Early Diagnosis", "Female", "Hospitals, University", "Humans", "London", "Outpatient Clinics, Hospital", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, First", "Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A", "Progesterone", "Prospective Studies", "Risk", "Up-Regulation", "Uterine Hemorrhage", "Uterus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924046357", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, UCL Institute for Women's Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "37085331600": {"Name": "Jamil A.", "AuthorID": "37085331600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, UCL Institute for Women's Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "7004871743": {"Name": "Jurkovic D.", "AuthorID": "7004871743", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, UCL Institute for Women's Health, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006303168": {"Name": "Gulbis B.", "AuthorID": "7006303168", "AffiliationID": "60068575, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Erasme Hospital, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}}}
