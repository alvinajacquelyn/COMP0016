Methodological updates to the DD-vMCG implementation are presented along with applications of the method to 2-, 3- and 4-state models of the butatriene cation. As a demonstration of the utility of the method, results of 3-state, full-dimensional calculations on the DNA base, thymine, are included, showing the energy dissipation through wavefunction population transfer between states.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabatisation", "Direct-dynamics", "Thymine", "vMCG"], "IndexKeywords": ["00-01", "99-00", "Diabatisation", "Direct dynamics", "Thymine", "VMCG"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015286024", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"23981006900": {"Name": "Richings G.", "AuthorID": "23981006900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "7006625328": {"Name": "Worth G.", "AuthorID": "7006625328", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}}}
