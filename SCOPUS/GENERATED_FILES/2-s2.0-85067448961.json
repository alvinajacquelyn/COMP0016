The APC/C and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) are just two of the many significant cell cycle regulators and exert control through ubiquitylation and phosphorylation, respectively. The temporal and spatial regulation of the APC/C is achieved by multiple mechanisms, including phosphorylation, interaction with the structurally related co-activators Cdc20 and Cdh1, loading of distinct E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, binding with inhibitors and differential affinities for various substrates. Since the discovery of APC/C 25 years ago, intensive studies have uncovered many aspects of APC/C regulation, but we are still far from a full understanding of this important cellular machinery. Recent high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy analysis and reconstitution of the APC/C have greatly advanced our understanding of molecular mechanisms underpinning the enzymatic properties of APC/C. In this review, we will examine the historical background and current understanding of APC/C regulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C)", "Cell cycle", "Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1)", "Proteolysis", "Ubiquitin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anaphase", "Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome", "Animals", "Cdc20 Proteins", "Cdh1 Proteins", "Humans", "Saccharomycetales", "Xenopus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067448961", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"7005880352": {"Name": "Yamano H.", "AuthorID": "7005880352", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Cycle Control Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
