The relationship between performance profiles, clinical characteristics, service utilization, and treatment adherence was also investigated.Method Consecutively recruited outpatients with a broad diagnosis of AN (restricting subtype AN-R: n=44, binge-purge subtype AN-BP: n=33 or Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified-AN subtype EDNOS-AN: n=23) completed a comprehensive set of neurocognitive (set-shifting, central coherence) and social-cognitive measures (Emotional Theory of Mind). Data were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis and a discriminant function analysis.Results Three separate, meaningful clusters emerged. Cluster 1 (n=45) showed overall average to high average neuro- and social- cognitive performance, Cluster 2 (n=38) showed mixed performance characterized by distinct strengths and weaknesses, and Cluster 3 (n=17) showed poor overall performance (Autism Spectrum disorder (ASD) like cluster). The three clusters did not differ in terms of eating disorder symptoms, comorbid features or service utilization and treatment adherence. A discriminant function analysis confirmed that the clusters were best characterized by performance in perseveration and set-shifting measures.Discussion The findings suggest that considerable neuro- and social-cognitive heterogeneity exists in patients with AN, with a subset showing ASD-like features. The value of this method of profiling in predicting longer term patient outcomes and in guiding development of etiologically targeted treatments remains to be seen.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anorexia nervosa", "eating disorder", "neuropsychology", "social cognition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Anorexia Nervosa", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Cluster Analysis", "Cognition", "Comorbidity", "Female", "Humans", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919772799", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55696310100": {"Name": "Renwick B.", "AuthorID": "55696310100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P059 Section of Eating Disorders, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "55320952300": {"Name": "Musiat P.", "AuthorID": "55320952300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P059 Section of Eating Disorders, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "55749216800": {"Name": "Lose A.", "AuthorID": "55749216800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P059 Section of Eating Disorders, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "37064390600": {"Name": "Dejong H.", "AuthorID": "37064390600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P059 Section of Eating Disorders, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "36607430000": {"Name": "Broadbent H.", "AuthorID": "36607430000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P059 Section of Eating Disorders, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "49963681400": {"Name": "Kenyon M.", "AuthorID": "49963681400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P059 Section of Eating Disorders, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "7006097367": {"Name": "Treasure J.", "AuthorID": "7006097367", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P059 Section of Eating Disorders, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "7402009547": {"Name": "Schmidt U.", "AuthorID": "7402009547", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "P059 Section of Eating Disorders, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}, "55748247900": {"Name": "Loomes R.", "AuthorID": "55748247900", "AffiliationID": "60000940", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Adult Eating Disorder Service, Cotswold House, Warneford Hospital"}, "35094999800": {"Name": "Boughton N.", "AuthorID": "35094999800", "AffiliationID": "60000940", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Adult Eating Disorder Service, Cotswold House, Warneford Hospital"}, "56346408500": {"Name": "Watson C.", "AuthorID": "56346408500", "AffiliationID": "113670802", "AffiliationName": "MHRN North London Hub"}, "55748595800": {"Name": "Ghelani S.", "AuthorID": "55748595800", "AffiliationID": "113670802", "AffiliationName": "MHRN North London Hub"}, "55747914900": {"Name": "Serpell L.", "AuthorID": "55747914900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57213217525": {"Name": "Richards L.", "AuthorID": "57213217525", "AffiliationID": "60001306", "AffiliationName": "Phoenix Wing, St Ann's Hospital"}, "6603376511": {"Name": "Johnson-Sabine E.", "AuthorID": "6603376511", "AffiliationID": "60001306", "AffiliationName": "Phoenix Wing, St Ann's Hospital"}}}
