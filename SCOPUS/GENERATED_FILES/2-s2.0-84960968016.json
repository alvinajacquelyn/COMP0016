Our longitudinal study of the design and construction of Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 by the British Airports Authority (BAA) makes three main contributions to the literature: (1) It contributes to the project management literature by identifying how specific dynamic capabilities (BAA's \"T5 Agreement,\" strategic behaviors, and collaborative processes) are developed through a three-phase process (learning, codifying, and mobilizing) to support the strategic management of complex projects. (2) While emphasizing their importance for the successful management of complex projects, our findings also underline the continuing fragility of dynamic capabilities. (3) The case study reveals their fluidity and balancing role with respect to demands for stability and change in complex, uncertain, and volatile project environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["complex projects", "dynamic capabilities", "owner operator", "risk and uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960968016", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57210968448": {"Name": "Davies A.", "AuthorID": "57210968448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "7003390135": {"Name": "Dodgson M.", "AuthorID": "7003390135", "AffiliationID": "60160279, 60031004", "AffiliationName": "University of Queensland Business School, University of Queensland"}, "7101878435": {"Name": "Gann D.", "AuthorID": "7101878435", "AffiliationID": "60116484, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Business School, Imperial College London"}}}
