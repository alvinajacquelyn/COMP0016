Therefore, understanding hazard factors and threat risk level is crucial for mitigating risk in coastal zones. This study examines coastal vulnerability factors and their influence along the Coastal Andhra Pradesh (CAP) region in India. CAP has been exposed to frequent hydrological and meteorological hazards due to variations in the geographical, geological, and bathymetric characteristics. Despite substantial vulnerabilities, the risk to the coastline of Andhra Pradesh has not been rigorously evaluated. The current research systematically reviews the drivers and effects of hazards and vulnerabilities in CAP. Findings indicate that urban cities have a considerably higher risk of cyclones and floods due to their locations on the Bay of Bengal tectonic plate, the topology of this coastal region, and higher population density. The study revealed that the Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI) data along CAP is mostly gathered using low-resolution satellite data and/or field observation surveys. The study further revealed that there are very few existing mitigation strategies developed or discussed within the obtained results. However, more accurate data gathering techniques for coastal vulnerability factors are available such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): Air-borne and LiDAR sensors, which provide very high resolution data and low-cost accessibility to physically inaccessible places, making them suitable for vulnerability data collection in coastal locations. These findings are useful for stakeholders seeking to reduce or ameliorate the impact of coastal disasters and their impacts on the CAP economy, environment, and population. The study further helps to reduce the existing shortcomings in the assessment techniques used previously.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coastal Andhra Pradesh", "Coastal vulnerability", "Disasters", "Natural hazards", "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Andhra Pradesh", "Coastal vulnerability", "Coastal vulnerability indices", "Natural hazard", "Population densities", "Very high resolution datum", "Vulnerability assessments", "Vulnerability factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065062211", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"]], "AuthorData": {"57190180111": {"Name": "Kantamaneni K.", "AuthorID": "57190180111", "AffiliationID": "60004128", "AffiliationName": "Warsash School of Maritime Science and Engineering, Solent University"}, "8885115400": {"Name": "Rani N.N.V.S.", "AuthorID": "8885115400", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "The Interdisciplinary Programme in Climate Studies Centre, Indian Institute of Technology"}, "36991749600": {"Name": "Rice L.", "AuthorID": "36991749600", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Architecture and Built Environment Research, University of the West of England"}, "56921959300": {"Name": "Sur K.", "AuthorID": "56921959300", "AffiliationID": "60018537", "AffiliationName": "Anand Agriculture University"}, "55203671600": {"Name": "Thayaparan M.", "AuthorID": "55203671600", "AffiliationID": "60071105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building Economics, Faculty of Architecture, University of Moratuwa"}, "57191098927": {"Name": "Kulatunga U.", "AuthorID": "57191098927", "AffiliationID": "60071105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Building Economics, Faculty of Architecture, University of Moratuwa"}, "57208544339": {"Name": "Rege R.", "AuthorID": "57208544339", "AffiliationID": "122490496", "AffiliationName": "Physics, maths and Science-Physics and Astronomy group, Tarrant County College, NW campus"}, "56811620800": {"Name": "Yenneti K.", "AuthorID": "56811620800", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Built Environment, University of New South Wales"}, "14043273200": {"Name": "Campos L.C.", "AuthorID": "14043273200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environment and Geomatic Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
