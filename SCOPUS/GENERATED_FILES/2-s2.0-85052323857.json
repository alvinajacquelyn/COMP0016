To understand protein aggregation in molecular detail, it is crucial to be able to characterize the array of heterogeneous aggregates that are formed during the aggregation process. We present here a high-throughput method to detect single protein aggregates, in solution, from a label-free aggregation reaction, and we demonstrate the approach with the protein associated with Parkinson's disease, \u03b1-synuclein. The method combines single-molecule confocal microscopy with a range of amyloid-binding extrinsic dyes, including thioflavin T and pentameric formylthiophene acetic acid, and we show that we can observe aggregates at low picomolar concentrations. The detection of individual aggregates allows us to quantify their numbers. Furthermore, we show that this approach also allows us to gain structural insights from the emission intensity of the extrinsic dyes that are bound to aggregates. By analyzing the time evolution of the aggregate populations on a single-molecule level, we then estimate the fragmentation rate of aggregates, a key process that underlies the multiplication of pathological aggregates. We additionally demonstrate that the method permits the detection of these aggregates in biological samples. The capability to detect individual protein aggregates in solution opens up a range of new applications, including exploiting the potential of this method for high-throughput screening of human biofluids for disease diagnosis and early detection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aggregation process", "High throughput screening", "High-throughput method", "Neurodegenerative disorders", "Parkinson's disease", "Protein aggregation", "Single molecule level", "Structural insights"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052323857", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"57213872318": {"Name": "Taylor C.G.", "AuthorID": "57213872318", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "54795619000": {"Name": "Meisl G.", "AuthorID": "54795619000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "14012356200": {"Name": "Knowles T.P.J.", "AuthorID": "14012356200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "7004374922": {"Name": "Klenerman D.", "AuthorID": "7004374922", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "U.K. Dementia Research Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "54882520800": {"Name": "Horrocks M.H.", "AuthorID": "54882520800", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "U.K. Dementia Research Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
