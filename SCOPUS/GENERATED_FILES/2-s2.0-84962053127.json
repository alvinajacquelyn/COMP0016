Experimental models have provided insights into the effects of mechanical deformation on the neuronal cytoskeleton and the subsequent processes that drive axonal injury. There is also increasing recognition that axonal or white matter loss may progress for years post-injury and represent one mechanistic framework for progressive neurodegeneration after TBI. Previous trials of novel therapies have failed to make an impact on clinical outcome, in both TBI in general and TAI in particular. Recent advances in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of injury have the potential to translate into novel therapeutic targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Axon", "Brain", "Degeneration", "Injury", "Therapeutics", "Traumatic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axons", "Brain", "Brain Injuries", "Diffuse Axonal Injury", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962053127", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"16746373000": {"Name": "Hill C.", "AuthorID": "16746373000", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair, University of Cambridge"}, "57212261333": {"Name": "Coleman M.", "AuthorID": "57212261333", "AffiliationID": "60120904, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair, University of Cambridge"}, "7101687199": {"Name": "Menon D.", "AuthorID": "7101687199", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}}}
