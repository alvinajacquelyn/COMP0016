This article presents a combined stratigraphic, sedimentologic, micropaleontologic, and provenance data for the Early Eocene clastic strata (Dajin Formation) in the Kailas area, southwestern Tibet. The Dajin Formation comprises ungraded and normally graded, matrix- and clast-supported conglomerates, ungraded and cross-stratified sandstones, and massive to poorly laminated mudstones. Deposition of the rocks is characterized by subaerial and subaqueous debris flows, waning gravity flows and suspension fallout. The larger benthic foraminifera and the youngest ages of the detrital zircons constrain the depositional age to the earliest Eocene (56-54Ma). The Dajin Formation contains abundant sandstone and mudstone clasts, indicating significant sedimentary recycling in the source area. U-Pb ages of detrital zircons are mostly clustered at ~120-54Ma and have positive \u03b5Hf(t) values, suggesting a Gangdese affinity. Clasts of the Dajin Formation are interpreted as having recycled from the forearc strata that were originally derived from the Gangdese magmatic arc. Highly immature texture and recycled provenance lead us to propose that deposition of the Dajin Formation was a result of the development of fold-thrusts in the Gangdese forearc. Our new results and published data from the coeval strata in the Himalayan orogen indicate that an underfilled foreland basin was initiated soon after the initial India-Asia collision, and the Dajin Formation records the wedge-top depozone of the basin system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early Eocene", "India-Asia collision", "Sedimentary recycling", "Southwestern Tibet", "Wedge-top basin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benthic foraminifera", "Detrital zircon", "Early Eocene", "Foreland basin", "Himalayan orogen", "India-Asia collision", "Southwestern Tibet", "Wedge-top basin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911425144", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"]], "AuthorData": {"37048081800": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "37048081800", "AffiliationID": "60016087", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Petroleum Resources and Prospecting, China University of Petroleum"}, "40561925600": {"Name": "Wu F.", "AuthorID": "40561925600", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Lithospheric Evolution, Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7404709350": {"Name": "Hu X.", "AuthorID": "7404709350", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Mineral Deposits Research, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University"}, "55265929900": {"Name": "Sun G.", "AuthorID": "55265929900", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Mineral Deposits Research, School of Earth Sciences and Engineering, Nanjing University"}, "6603431289": {"Name": "BouDagher-Fadel M.", "AuthorID": "6603431289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
