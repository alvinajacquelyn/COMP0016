The prevalence of CVD in India has risen over the past 2 decades due to population growth, aging, and a stable age-adjusted CVD mortality rate. Over the same time period, the United States has experienced an overall decline in age-adjusted CVD mortality, although the trend has begun to plateau. These improvements in CVD mortality in the United States are largely due to favorable population-level risk factor trends, specifically with regard to tobacco use, cholesterol, and blood pressure, although improvements in secondary prevention and acute care have also contributed. To realize similar gains in reducing premature death and disability from CVD, India needs to implement population-level policies while strengthening and integrating its local, regional, and national health systems. Achieving universal health coverage that includes financial risk protection should remain a goal to help all Indians realize their right to health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "health policy", "health systems", "review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "India", "Mortality", "Risk Factors", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048823067", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7004283783": {"Name": "Prabhakaran D.", "AuthorID": "7004283783", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56506007300": {"Name": "Singh K.", "AuthorID": "56506007300", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Foundation of India and Centre for Chronic Disease Control"}, "55074747400": {"Name": "Roth G.A.", "AuthorID": "55074747400", "AffiliationID": "60091926, 60028548", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and the Division of Cardiology at the University of Washington School of Medicine"}, "57208560645": {"Name": "Banerjee A.", "AuthorID": "57208560645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "26537866700": {"Name": "Pagidipati N.J.", "AuthorID": "26537866700", "AffiliationID": "60005200", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine"}, "26967803300": {"Name": "Huffman M.D.", "AuthorID": "26967803300", "AffiliationID": "60013227", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine"}}}
