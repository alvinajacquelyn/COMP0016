Analysis of the desorption yield, in combination with theoretical calculations, indicates the crucial role played by the applied electric field. Instead of facilitating desorption by reducing the barrier height, the applied electric field causes a reduction in the barrier width, which, when coupled with the electron excitation induced by the STM tip, leads to the tunneling desorption of the hydrogen. A significant reduction in the desorption yield was observed when deuterium was used instead of hydrogen, providing further support for the tunneling-desorption mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["defect", "manipulation", "scanning tunneling microscopy", "titanium dioxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Barrier heights", "Desorption mechanism", "Desorption yield", "Electron excitations", "manipulation", "Reaction mechanism", "Theoretical calculations", "Titanium dioxide surfaces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938153099", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7005390662": {"Name": "Minato T.", "AuthorID": "7005390662", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Office of Society-Academia Collaboration for Innovation, Kyoto University"}, "7410196072": {"Name": "Kim Y.", "AuthorID": "7410196072", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "Surface and Interface Science Laboratory, RIKEN"}, "12239498500": {"Name": "Kajita S.", "AuthorID": "12239498500", "AffiliationID": "60003416", "AffiliationName": "Toyota Central R and D Labs, Inc."}, "35378402800": {"Name": "Nakayama T.", "AuthorID": "35378402800", "AffiliationID": "60002787", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Chiba University"}, "7201425162": {"Name": "Pang C.L.", "AuthorID": "7201425162", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003958469": {"Name": "Asao N.", "AuthorID": "7003958469", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "WPI Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University"}, "57203499199": {"Name": "Yamamoto Y.", "AuthorID": "57203499199", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "WPI Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University"}, "7403311888": {"Name": "Kawai M.", "AuthorID": "7403311888", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Materials Science, University of Tokyo"}}}
