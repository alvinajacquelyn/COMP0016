In this work, we introduce a new mm-wave frequency transmission scheme that exploits a combination of the concepts of beamspace multi-input multi-output (B-MIMO) communications and beam selection to provide near-optimal performances with a low hardware-complexity transceiver. While large-scale MIMO approaches in mm-wave are affected by high dimensional signal space that increases considerably both complexity and costs of the system, the proposed scheme is able to achieve near-optimal performances with a reduced radio-frequency (RF) complexity thanks to beam selection. We evaluate the advantages of the proposed scheme via capacity computations, comparisons of numbers of RF chains required and by studying the trade-off between spectral and power efficiency. Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is capable of offering a significant reduction in RF complexity with a realistic low-cost approach, for a given performance. In particular, we show that the proposed beam selection algorithms achieve higher power efficiencies than a full system where all beams are utilized.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beam selection", "beamforming", "Capacity maximization", "High dimensional MIMO", "Multiuser MIMO", "SINR maximization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Beam selection", "Hardware complexity", "High-dimensional mimo", "Millimeter-wave (mm-wave)", "Multi input multi output", "Multi-user MIMO", "Near-optimal performance", "SINR maximization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933576506", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56703112800": {"Name": "Amadori P.", "AuthorID": "56703112800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
