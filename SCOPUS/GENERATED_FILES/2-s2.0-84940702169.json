All rights reserved.In this paper we introduce three methods for re-scaling data sets aiming at improving the likelihood of clustering validity indexes to return the true number of spherical Gaussian clusters with additional noise features. Our method obtains feature re-scaling factors taking into account the structure of a given data set and the intuitive idea that different features may have different degrees of relevance at different clusters. We experiment with the Silhouette (using squared Euclidean, Manhattan, and the pth power of the Minkowski distance), Dunn's, Calinski-Harabasz and Hartigan indexes on data sets with spherical Gaussian clusters with and without noise features. We conclude that our methods indeed increase the chances of estimating the true number of clusters in a data set.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cluster validity index", "Clustering", "Feature re-scaling", "Feature weighting", "K-Means"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cluster validity indices", "Clustering", "Feature re-scaling", "Feature weighting", "K-means"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940702169", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"26967512400": {"Name": "De Amorim R.", "AuthorID": "26967512400", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane Campus"}, "57196610402": {"Name": "Hennig C.", "AuthorID": "57196610402", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
