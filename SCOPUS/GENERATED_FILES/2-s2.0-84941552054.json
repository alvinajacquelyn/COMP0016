A popular hypothesis is that resistant hypertension is due to excessive Na<sup>+</sup>-retention, and that 'further diuretic therapy' will be superior to alternative add-on drugs. Methods and analysis: Placebo-controlled, random crossover study of fourth-line treatment when added to standard (A+C+D) triple drug therapy: ACE inhibitor or Angiotensin receptor blocker (A) +Calcium channel blocker (C)+Diuretic (D). Patients (aged 18-79 years) with clinical systolic BP\u2265140 mm Hg (135 mm Hg in diabetics) and Home BP Monitoring (HBPM) systolic BP average \u2265130 mm Hg on treatment for at least 3 months with maximum tolerated doses of A+C+D are randomised to four consecutive randomly allocated 12-week treatment cycles with an \u03b1-blocker, \u03b2-blocker, spironolactone and placebo. The hierarchical coprimary end point is the difference in HBPM average systolic BP between (in order) spironolactone and placebo, spironolactone and the average of the other two active drugs, spironolactone and each of the other two drugs. A key secondary outcome is to determine whether plasma renin predicts the BP response to the different drugs. A sample size of 346 (allowing 15% dropouts) will confer 90% power to detect a 3 mm Hg HBPM average systolic BP difference between any two drugs. The study can also detect a 6 mm Hg difference in HBPM average systolic BP between each patient's best and second-best drug predicted by tertile of plasma renin. Ethics and dissemination: The study was initiated in May 2009 and results are expected in 2015. These will provide RCT evidence to support future guideline recommendations for optimal drug treatment of resistant hypertension.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Calcium Channel Blockers", "Clinical Protocols", "Cross-Over Studies", "Diuretics", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Spironolactone", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941552054", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London (UCL)"}, "7202857284": {"Name": "MacDonald T.M.", "AuthorID": "7202857284", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Institute, Medicines Monitoring Unit, University of Dundee"}, "7102853527": {"Name": "Caulfield M.", "AuthorID": "7102853527", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Institute, QMUL"}, "7102958225": {"Name": "Kennedy Cruickshank J.", "AuthorID": "7102958225", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Medicine and Diabetes, King's College London"}, "56905645300": {"Name": "McInnes G.", "AuthorID": "56905645300", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60016417", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "35370752300": {"Name": "Sever P.", "AuthorID": "35370752300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Circulatory Health, Imperial College"}, "35432554600": {"Name": "Webb D.J.", "AuthorID": "35432554600", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, University of Edinburgh"}, "52464394300": {"Name": "Salsbury J.", "AuthorID": "52464394300", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "6603741777": {"Name": "Morant S.", "AuthorID": "6603741777", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7405387005": {"Name": "Brown M.J.", "AuthorID": "7405387005", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, University of Cambridge, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7006691891": {"Name": "Ford I.", "AuthorID": "7006691891", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Robertson Centre, University of Glasgow"}}}
