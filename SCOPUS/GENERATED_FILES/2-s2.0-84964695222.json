Single shot imaging is inherently immune to ghost type artifacts. We propose a free-breathing method based on respiratory motion corrected single shot imaging with averaging to improve the signal to noise ratio. Methods: Images were acquired using a multi-echo gradient recalled echo sequence and T2\u2217 maps were calculated at each pixel by exponential fitting. For 40 subjects (2 cohorts), two acquisition protocols were compared: (1) a breath-held, segmented acquisition, and (2) a free-breathing, single-shot multiple repetition respiratory motion corrected average. T2\u2217 measurements in the interventricular septum and liver were compared for the 2-methods in all studies with diagnostic image quality. Results: In cohort 1 (N = 28) with age 51.4 \u00b1 17.6 (m \u00b1 SD) including 1 subject with severe myocardial iron overload, there were 8 non-diagnostic breath-held studies due to poor image quality resulting from ghost artifacts caused by respiratory motion or arrhythmias. In cohort 2 (N = 12) with age 30.9 \u00b1 7.5 (m \u00b1 SD), including 7 subjects with severe myocardial iron overload and 4 subjects with mild iron overload, a single subject was unable to breath-hold. Free-breathing motion corrected T2\u2217 maps were of diagnostic quality in all 40 subjects. T2\u2217 measurements were in excellent agreement (In cohort #1, T2\u2217FB = 0.95 x T2\u2217BH + 0.41, r2 = 0.93, N = 39 measurements, and in cohort #2, T2\u2217FB = 0.98 x T2\u2217BH + 0.05, r2 > 0.99, N = 22 measurements). Conclusions: A free-breathing approach to T2\u2217 mapping is demonstrated to produce consistently good quality maps in the presence of respiratory motion and arrhythmias.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular magnetic resonance", "Hemochromatosis", "Iron", "Mapping", "Motion correction", "R2\u2217", "T2\u2217", "Thalassemia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Artifacts", "Breath Holding", "Cohort Studies", "Heart Septum", "Humans", "Liver", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Middle Aged", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Myocardium", "Respiration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964695222", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7004851504": {"Name": "Kellman P.", "AuthorID": "7004851504", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}, "52365249300": {"Name": "Xue H.", "AuthorID": "52365249300", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}, "57212022397": {"Name": "Sandino C.M.", "AuthorID": "57212022397", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}, "35562748700": {"Name": "Hansen M.S.", "AuthorID": "35562748700", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}, "16305132900": {"Name": "Mancini C.", "AuthorID": "16305132900", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}, "25621227200": {"Name": "Bandettini W.P.", "AuthorID": "25621227200", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}, "7103347595": {"Name": "Arai A.E.", "AuthorID": "7103347595", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, DHHS"}, "15053644600": {"Name": "Spottiswoode B.S.", "AuthorID": "15053644600", "AffiliationID": "60084261", "AffiliationName": "Siemens Medical Solutions, USA, Inc"}, "56528300800": {"Name": "Abdel-Gadir A.", "AuthorID": "56528300800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "35620856500": {"Name": "Rosmini S.", "AuthorID": "35620856500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Heart Hospital"}, "55534321200": {"Name": "McGill L.A.", "AuthorID": "55534321200", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7003278320": {"Name": "Gatehouse P.", "AuthorID": "7003278320", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7103221771": {"Name": "Pennell D.J.", "AuthorID": "7103221771", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}}}
