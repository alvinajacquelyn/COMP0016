Studies of the growth of CBZ-V on DHC-II single crystals show crystals growing laterally and vertically on DHC-II surfaces without any significant face selectivity. The generality of this computationally inspired crystallisation approach is demonstrated by producing the first crystals of an entirely new polymorph of cyheptamide, which is isomorphous to both DHC-II and CBZ-V.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973303818", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55372654400": {"Name": "Srirambhatla V.K.", "AuthorID": "55372654400", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Technology Innovation Centre"}, "7102444974": {"Name": "Florence A.J.", "AuthorID": "7102444974", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, University of Strathclyde, Technology Innovation Centre"}, "36056622300": {"Name": "Guo R.", "AuthorID": "36056622300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202475468": {"Name": "Price S.L.", "AuthorID": "7202475468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
