The cells are seeded in a scaffold in a layer on top of the hollow fibre, only partially occupying the extracapillary space. Above this layer is a region of free-flowing fluid which we refer to as the upper fluid layer. The flow in the lumen and upper fluid layer is described by the Stokes equations, whilst the flow in the porous fibre membrane is assumed to follow Darcy\u2019s law. Porous mixture theory is used to model the dynamics of and interactions between the cells, scaffold and fluid in the cell\u2013scaffold construct. The concentration of a limiting nutrient (e.g. oxygen) is governed by an advection\u2013reaction\u2013diffusion equation in each region. Through exploitation of the small aspect ratio of each region and asymptotic analysis, we derive a coupled system of partial differential equations for the cell volume fraction and nutrient concentration. We use this model to investigate the effect of mechanotransduction on the distribution and yield of the cell population, by considering cases in which cell proliferation is either enhanced or limited by fluid shear stress and by varying experimentally controllable parameters such as flow rate and cell\u2013scaffold construct thickness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymptotic reduction", "Mechanotransduction", "Multiphase flow", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell volume fraction", "Controllable parameters", "Diffusion equations", "Hollow-fibre membrane", "Mechanotransduction", "Nutrient concentrations", "Scaffold constructs", "Two dimensional model", "Bioreactors", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells", "Membranes, Artificial", "Models, Biological", "Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted", "Rheology", "Shear Strength", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924358412", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55911452400": {"Name": "Pearson N.C.", "AuthorID": "55911452400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "OCIAM, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "7103194539": {"Name": "Waters S.L.", "AuthorID": "7103194539", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "OCIAM, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "9276756500": {"Name": "Oliver J.M.", "AuthorID": "9276756500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "OCIAM, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "24921854100": {"Name": "Shipley R.J.", "AuthorID": "24921854100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biomechanical Engineering Group, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
