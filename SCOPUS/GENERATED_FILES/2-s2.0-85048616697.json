All rights reserved.Background: Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) is an established treatment for selected Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, but therapy is often limited by side effects. Previous studies indicate an inverse relationship of the therapeutic window (TW) to pulse width (PW) settings down to 60s, but there is limited data available on the effect of shorter PWs. Objective: To define the TW of STN-DBS in PD at PW of 30's (PW30) relative to standard PW settings at 60\u03bcs (PW60), and to compare speed of gait and speech intelligibility on the two PW conditions. Methods: Monopolar review data of 15 consecutive PD patients who had screening of contacts performed at PW60 and PW30 was used to calculate the TW at each contact. We compared the TWs of the most efficacious contact per STN, and a secondary analysis was performed comparing all contacts. Speed of gait with a timed 10 metre walk test, speech intelligibility, and perceptual characteristics of speech were also compared at the efficacy thresholds for PW60 and PW30. Results: The TW was significantly greater at PW30 [3.8\u00b11.6mA] than at PW60 [1.7\u00b11.1mA]. In the secondary analysis, 110 TWs could be calculated and these remained significantly higher at PW30. The timed 10 metre walk at PW30 was faster than at PW60, and perceptual rating scores of speech were significantly improved at PW30. Conclusions: STN-DBS in PD patients using a PWof 30\u03bcs significantly increases theTWcompared to standardPWsettings, and this effect is consistent across all contacts of an electrode. Speed of gait and perceptual speech scores are also improved at 30\u03bcs settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "electrical parameters", "gait", "Parkinson's disease", "pulse width", "side effects", "speech intelligibility", "subthalamic nucleus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Deep Brain Stimulation", "Female", "Gait", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Speech Intelligibility", "Subthalamic Nucleus", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048616697", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57194225886": {"Name": "Dayal V.", "AuthorID": "57194225886", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57202513068": {"Name": "Grover T.", "AuthorID": "57202513068", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "23768093200": {"Name": "Akram H.", "AuthorID": "23768093200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57188656721": {"Name": "Cappon D.", "AuthorID": "57188656721", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56133515000": {"Name": "Candelario J.", "AuthorID": "56133515000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57202513566": {"Name": "Salazar M.", "AuthorID": "57202513566", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "24340411000": {"Name": "Tripoliti E.", "AuthorID": "24340411000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "15072861200": {"Name": "Hyam J.", "AuthorID": "15072861200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7006891841": {"Name": "Jahanshahi M.", "AuthorID": "7006891841", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
