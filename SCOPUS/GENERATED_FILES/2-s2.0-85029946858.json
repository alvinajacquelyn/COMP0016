The Authors.A multiple auroral onset substorm on 28 March 2010 provides an opportunity to understand the physical mechanism in generating auroral intensifications during a substorm expansion phase. Conjugate observations of magnetic fields and plasma from the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft, of field-aligned currents (FACs) from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) satellites, and from ground-based magnetometers and aurora are all available. The comprehensive measurements allow us to further our understanding of the complicated causalities among dipolarization, FAC generation, particle acceleration, and auroral intensification. During the substorm expansion phase, the plasma sheet expanded and was perturbed leading to the generation of a slow mode wave, which modulated electron flux in the outer plasma sheet. During this current sheet expansion, field-aligned currents formed, and geomagnetic perturbations were simultaneously detected by ground-based instruments. However, a magnetic dipolarization did not occur until about 3 min later in the outer plasma sheet observed by THEMIS-A spacecraft (THA). We believe that this dipolarization led to an efficient Fermi acceleration to electrons and consequently the cause of a significant auroral intensification during the expansion phase as observed by the All-Sky Imagers (ASIs). This Fermi acceleration mechanism operating efficiently in the outer plasma sheet during the expansion phase could be a common explanation of the poleward auroral development after substorm onset. These results also show a good agreement between the upward FAC derived from AMPERE measurements and the auroral brightening observed by the ASIs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aurora", "field-aligned current", "magnetotail", "plasma sheet", "substorm"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029946858", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57197843335": {"Name": "Yao Z.", "AuthorID": "57197843335", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, STAR Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "7003431703": {"Name": "Rae I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003431703", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7202893081": {"Name": "Owen C.J.", "AuthorID": "7202893081", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "23488620900": {"Name": "Forsyth C.", "AuthorID": "23488620900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "56146292000": {"Name": "Kalmoni N.M.E.", "AuthorID": "56146292000", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "8286503700": {"Name": "Grodent D.", "AuthorID": "8286503700", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, STAR Institute, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "7103201468": {"Name": "Lui A.T.Y.", "AuthorID": "7103201468", "AffiliationID": "60022054", "AffiliationName": "The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"}, "25723507400": {"Name": "Murphy K.R.", "AuthorID": "25723507400", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre"}, "7006788329": {"Name": "Pu Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "7006788329", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "7006197877": {"Name": "Zong Q.G.", "AuthorID": "7006197877", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "24471514300": {"Name": "Du A.M.", "AuthorID": "24471514300", "AffiliationID": "60019499, 60109828", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
