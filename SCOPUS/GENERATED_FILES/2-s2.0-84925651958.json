Methods Mice were implanted subcutaneously with either unmodified control cells or otherwise identical cells expressing UTB. After injection of hyperpolarized [13C]urea, a spin echo sequence was used to measure urea concentration, T1, and diffusion in control and UTB-expressing tissue. Results The apparent diffusion coefficient of hyperpolarized urea was 21% lower in tissue expressing UTB, in comparison with control tissue (P<0.05, 1-tailed t-test, n=6 in each group). No difference in water apparent diffusion coefficient or cellularity between these tissues was found, indicating that they were otherwise similar in composition. Conclusion Expression of UTB, by mediating cell uptake of urea, lowers the apparent diffusion coefficient of hyperpolarized 13C urea in tissue and thus the transporter has the potential to be used as a magnetic resonance-based gene reporter in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["13C MRS", "Gene reporter", "hyperpolarization", "urea transporter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apparent diffusion coefficient", "Control tissues", "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance", "Hyperpolarization", "In compositions", "Reporter systems", "Transgene expression", "^13C MRS", "Animals", "Carbon Isotopes", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, SCID", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tissue Distribution", "Transgenes", "Urea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925651958", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56572907300": {"Name": "Stephen Patrick P.", "AuthorID": "56572907300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7004862126": {"Name": "Kettunen M.I.", "AuthorID": "7004862126", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "A.I.
