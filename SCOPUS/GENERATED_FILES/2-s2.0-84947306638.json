Common precipitants include bacterial and viral infections, alcoholic hepatitis, and surgery, but in more than 40% of patients, no precipitating event is identified. Systemic inflammation and susceptibility to infection are characteristic pathophysiological features. A new diagnostic score, the Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) organ failure score, has been developed for classification and prognostic assessment of patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. Disease can be reversed in many patients, and thus clinical management focuses upon the identification and treatment of the precipitant while providing multiorgan-supportive care that addresses the complex pattern of physiological disturbance in critically ill patients with liver disease. Liver transplantation is a highly effective intervention in some specific cases, but recipient identification, organ availability, timing of transplantation, and high resource use are barriers to more widespread application. Recognition of acute-on-chronic liver failure as a clinically and pathophysiologically distinct syndrome with defined diagnostic and prognostic criteria will help to encourage the development of new management pathways and interventions to address the unacceptably high mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute-On-Chronic Liver Failure", "Bacterial Infections", "Blood Coagulation Disorders", "Brain Diseases", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Liver Transplantation", "Organ Dysfunction Scores", "Renal Insufficiency", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947306638", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6602091073": {"Name": "Bernal W.", "AuthorID": "6602091073", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Liver Intensive Therapy Unit, King's College Hospital"}, "7005997966": {"Name": "Wendon J.", "AuthorID": "7005997966", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Liver Intensive Therapy Unit, King's College Hospital"}, "55357692500": {"Name": "Quaglia A.", "AuthorID": "55357692500", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Section, Institute of Liver Studies, King's College Hospital"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56450243500": {"Name": "Burroughs A.", "AuthorID": "56450243500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7202687170": {"Name": "Simpson K.", "AuthorID": "7202687170", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, University of Edinburgh"}}}
