We found that local changes to the configuration of the enclosure induce individual grid fields to shift in a manner inversely related to their distance from the reconfigured boundary. The grid remained primarily anchored to the unchanged stable walls and showed a nonuniform rescaling. Shifts in simultaneously recorded colocalized grid fields were strongly correlated, which suggests that the readout of the animal\u2019s position might still be intact. Similar field shifts were also observed in place and boundary cells\u2014albeit of greater magnitude and more pronounced closer to the reconfigured boundary\u2014which suggests that there is no simple one-to-one relationship between these three different cell types.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Rats", "Rats, Inbred Strains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043245927", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26657474100": {"Name": "Krupic J.", "AuthorID": "26657474100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "35489978500": {"Name": "Bauza M.", "AuthorID": "35489978500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, University College London"}, "7101707140": {"Name": "Burton S.", "AuthorID": "7101707140", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, University College London"}, "35478840000": {"Name": "O\u2019Keefe J.", "AuthorID": "35478840000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, University College London"}}}
