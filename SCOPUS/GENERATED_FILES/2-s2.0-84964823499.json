In this paper we investigated how tangible devices can be used to gather feedback from children in the context of a theater performance. We introduce SmallTalk, a tangible survey system designed for use within a theater space to capture what children, aged 4 to 9, thought of a live performance they had just seen. We describe how the system was designed to build on previous feedback methods that had been tried; while at the same time meeting the constraints of the challenging theater context. We present results from seven deployments of SmallTalk and based on these we briefly discuss its value as a method for evaluating the theater performance. We then look at how the results validated the system design and present several design implications that more generally relate to tangible feedback systems for children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Design for children", "Design research", "Feedback systems", "Opinion gathering", "Tangible interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design for children", "Design research", "Feedback systems", "Opinion gathering", "Tangible interaction"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964823499", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"35810143200": {"Name": "Gallacher S.", "AuthorID": "35810143200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35092348300": {"Name": "Golsteijn C.", "AuthorID": "35092348300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003925319": {"Name": "Rogers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003925319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003753918": {"Name": "Capra L.", "AuthorID": "7003753918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57189038151": {"Name": "Eustace S.", "AuthorID": "57189038151", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Fevered Sleep"}}}
