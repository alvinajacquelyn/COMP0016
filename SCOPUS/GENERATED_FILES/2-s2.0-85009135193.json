Methods and Materials Radioisotope-guided SLND was performed in 224 clinically node-negative patients scheduled to undergo external beam radiation therapy. Patients with histologically positive SLNs (pN1) were also offered radiation therapy to the pelvic lymph nodes, combined with 3 years of ADT. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), overall survival, and metastasis-free (including pelvic and nonregional lymph nodes) survival (MFS) rates were retrospectively calculated. The Briganti and Kattan nomogram predictions were compared with the observed pN status and BCR. Results The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 15.4 ng/mL (interquartile range [IQR] 8-29). A total number of 834 SLNs (median 3 per patient; IQR 2-5) were removed. Nodal metastases were diagnosed in 42% of the patients, with 150 SLNs affected (median 1; IQR 1-2). The 5-year BCR-free and MFS rates for pN0 patients were 67.9% and 87.8%, respectively. The corresponding values for pN1 patients were 43% and 66.6%. The PSA level and number of removed SLNs were independent predictors of BCR and MFS, and pN status was an additional independent predictor of BCR. The 5-year overall survival rate was 97.6% and correlated only with pN status. The predictive accuracy of the Briganti nomogram was 0.665. Patients in the higher quartiles of Kattan nomogram prediction of BCR had better than expected outcomes. The complication rate from SLND was 8.9%. Conclusions For radioisotope-guided SLND, the high staging accuracy is accompanied by low morbidity. The better than expected outcomes observed in the lower quartiles of BCR prediction suggest a role for SLN biopsy as a potential selection tool for the addition of pelvic radiation therapy and ADT intensification in pN1 patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["External beam radiation therapy", "Independent predictors", "Inter quartile ranges", "Long-term androgen deprivation", "Methods and materials", "Overall survival rates", "Prostate specific antigen", "Sentinel lymph nodes", "Aged", "Androgen Antagonists", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Lymphatic Irradiation", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Neoplasm Staging", "Nomograms", "Patient Selection", "Pelvis", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Radiotherapy, Conformal", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy", "Statistics, Nonparametric"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009135193", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55539293100": {"Name": "Grivas N.", "AuthorID": "55539293100", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "6508174892": {"Name": "Wit E.", "AuthorID": "6508174892", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "13404680900": {"Name": "Hendricksen K.", "AuthorID": "13404680900", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "8889252000": {"Name": "Horenblas S.", "AuthorID": "8889252000", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "55939384500": {"Name": "KleinJan G.", "AuthorID": "55939384500", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Molecular Imaging Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6602152865": {"Name": "van Rhijn B.", "AuthorID": "6602152865", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "7004230990": {"Name": "van der Poel H.", "AuthorID": "7004230990", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "6603370824": {"Name": "Pos F.", "AuthorID": "6603370824", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "15764595100": {"Name": "de Jong J.", "AuthorID": "15764595100", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "6506106611": {"Name": "Vegt E.", "AuthorID": "6506106611", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}}}
