Neonates born preterm and small for gestational age are particularly at risk given the high incidence of infectious complications, cardiopulmonary, and neurodevelopmental disorders in this group. Quality improvement (QI) initiatives can reduce the burden of mortality and morbidity for hospitalised newborns in these settings. We undertook a systematic review to synthesise evidence from LMICs on QI approaches used, outcome measures employed to estimate effects, and the nature of implementation challenges. Methods: We searched Medline, EMBASE, WHO Global Health Library, Cochrane Library, WHO ICTRP, and ClinicalTrials.gov and scanned the references of identified studies and systematic reviews. Searches covered January 2000 until April 2017. Search terms were \"quality improvement\", \"newborns\", \"hospitalised\", and their derivatives. Studies were excluded if they took place in high-income countries, did not include QI interventions, or did not include small and sick hospitalised newborns. Cochrane Risk of Bias tools were used to quality appraise the studies. Results: From 8110 results, 28 studies were included, covering 23 LMICs and 65,642 participants. Most interventions were meso level (district and clinic level); fewer were micro (patient-provider level) or macro (above district level). In-service training was the most common intervention subtype; service organisation and distribution of referencing materials were also frequently identified. The most commonly assessed outcome was mortality, followed by length of admission, sepsis rates, and infection rates. Key barriers to implementation of quality improvement initiatives included overburdened staff and lack of sufficient equipment. Conclusions: The frequency of meso level, single centre, and educational interventions suggests that these interventions may be easier for programme planners to implement. The success of some interventions in reducing morbidity and mortality rates suggests that QI approaches have a high potential for benefit to newborns. Going forward, there are opportunities to strengthen the focus of QI initiatives and to develop improved, larger-scale, collaborative research into implementation of quality improvement initiatives for this high-risk group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hospital stay", "Infection control", "Low- and middle-income countries", "Neonatal mortality rates", "Newborns", "Preterm", "Quality improvement", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Developing Countries", "Female", "Global Health", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Infant, Small for Gestational Age", "Kangaroo-Mother Care Method", "Male", "Poverty", "Pregnancy", "Quality Improvement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041621089", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"54785679800": {"Name": "Zaka N.", "AuthorID": "54785679800", "AffiliationID": "60008710", "AffiliationName": "UNICEF New York"}, "36499843200": {"Name": "Manikam L.", "AuthorID": "36499843200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute Epidemiology and Healthcare"}, "8100398200": {"Name": "Pearson L.", "AuthorID": "8100398200", "AffiliationID": "60008710", "AffiliationName": "UNICEF New York"}, "57200553338": {"Name": "Alexander E.C.", "AuthorID": "57200553338", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London GKT School of Medical Education"}, "57200537362": {"Name": "Norman I.C.F.", "AuthorID": "57200537362", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London GKT School of Medical Education"}, "57200554583": {"Name": "Akhbari M.", "AuthorID": "57200554583", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London GKT School of Medical Education"}, "56779804700": {"Name": "Moxon S.", "AuthorID": "56779804700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Maternal, Adolescent, Reproductive, Child Health Centre and Dept. of Infectious Disease Epidemiology"}, "16053388600": {"Name": "Ram P.K.", "AuthorID": "16053388600", "AffiliationID": "60008275", "AffiliationName": "USAID, Office of Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition"}, "6603996627": {"Name": "Niermeyer S.", "AuthorID": "6603996627", "AffiliationID": "60028421", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado School of Medicine, Section of Neonatology"}, "57191839770": {"Name": "Murphy G.", "AuthorID": "57191839770", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine Research Building"}, "7103140305": {"Name": "English M.", "AuthorID": "7103140305", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine Research Building"}}}
