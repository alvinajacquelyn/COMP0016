Karger AG, Basel.Aim: To characterize by multimodal approach the phenotype of patients from a 3 generations pedigree, affected by autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CRD), found to carry a novel pathogenic variant in the cone-rod homeobox-containing (CRX) gene. Methods: Examination of the adult patients included the following tests: visual acuity, multicolour imaging, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and OCT angiography (OCT-A) recordings. In a 2.5-year-old child, cycloplegic refraction, fundoscopy, ocular motility evaluation and electrophysiological exams were performed. Next Generation Sequencing of patients' DNA has been carried out. Results: A novel CRX pathogenic variant has been identified in our patients. The 2.5-year-old child in the third generation was found to have inherited the variant, with no clinical signs of the condition, but electroretinographic abnormalities in the scotopic component. In the adult patients, diffuse atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium/photoreceptor complex in the macular region was evident at the OCT and FAF, while OCT-A showed choriocapillaris density reduction. Conclusions: Multimodal study allowed the characterization of a peculiar form of CRD. The novel pathogenic variant seems to have a different effect on the phenotype if compared with a previously described similar one, giving an insight into the pathogenic mechanism of CRX-related retinal dystrophies and offering valuable information that could lead to the development of possible future therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cone-rod dystrophy", "CRX", "Inherited retinal dystrophies", "Multimodal imaging", "Optical coherence tomography angiography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child, Preschool", "Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Cation Channels", "Electroretinography", "Female", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Humans", "Male", "Multimodal Imaging", "Night Vision", "Phenotype", "Retina", "Retinal Dystrophies", "Trans-Activators", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052678770", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"15748232100": {"Name": "D'Esposito F.", "AuthorID": "15748232100", "AffiliationID": "121308254", "AffiliationName": "Centro GI.MA."}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Cordeiro M.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016550, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Ophthalmic Research Unit, Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "6602180859": {"Name": "De Crecchio G.", "AuthorID": "6602180859", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Eye Clinic, Reproductive Sciences and Dentistry, Federico II University"}, "57210651727": {"Name": "Cennamo G.", "AuthorID": "57210651727", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Eye Clinic, Reproductive Sciences and Dentistry, Federico II University"}, "55851947814": {"Name": "Cennamo G.", "AuthorID": "55851947814", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Eye Clinic, Federico II University"}, "34570910300": {"Name": "Maltese P.", "AuthorID": "34570910300", "AffiliationID": "115216707", "AffiliationName": "MAGI'S Lab"}, "6507592431": {"Name": "Cecchin S.", "AuthorID": "6507592431", "AffiliationID": "115216707", "AffiliationName": "MAGI'S Lab"}, "15050393400": {"Name": "Bertelli M.", "AuthorID": "15050393400", "AffiliationID": "60111041", "AffiliationName": "MAGI Euregio"}, "24340093900": {"Name": "Ziccardi L.", "AuthorID": "24340093900", "AffiliationID": "60103773", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS-Fondazione Bietti"}, "56388768200": {"Name": "Esposito Veneruso P.", "AuthorID": "56388768200", "AffiliationID": "121308254", "AffiliationName": "Centro GI.MA."}, "55669867400": {"Name": "Magli A.", "AuthorID": "55669867400", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Ophthalmology, University of Salerno"}}}
