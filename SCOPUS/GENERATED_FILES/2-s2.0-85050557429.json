Alimentary Pharmacology & Therapeutics published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: The rs738409 C>G p.I148M variant in the patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3)-gene promotes triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cell activation and has previously been linked to hepatic steatosis/liver fibrosis. Aim: To investigate its impact on hepatic decompensation and (liver-related) mortality in patients who had already developed portal hypertension. Moreover, we assessed its link with hepatic steatosis as evaluated by controlled attenuation parameter. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis in prospectively characterised patients with viral hepatitis/fatty liver disease-induced portal hypertension (hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] \u2265 6 mm Hg) diagnosed at the Medical University of Vienna who underwent HVPG measurement (until 2013; n = 372; longitudinal study) or simultaneous HVPG and controlled attenuation parameter measurement (2014-2017; n = 153; cross-sectional study). Results: While survival was similar between PNPLA3-C/C and -C/G patients, we observed substantially increased mortality in PNPLA3-G/G patients. PNPLA3-G/G had no impact on mortality in the subgroup of patients with viral hepatitis; however, we observed a strong independent association between PNPLA3-G/G and hepatic decompensation (adjusted subdistribution hazard ratio [aSHR]: 2.1, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.1-4; P = 0.024) as well as mortality (overall: aSHR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.22-3.98; P = 0.009; liver-related: aSHR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.08-4.46; P = 0.029) in patients with fatty liver disease. Interestingly, even in the subgroup of patients who had already progressed to clinically significant portal hypertension (HVPG \u2265 10 mm Hg), PNPLA3-G/G substantially increased mortality (aSHR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.27-4.29; P = 0.006). PNPLA3-genotype had no influence on controlled attenuation parameter or the prevalence of values \u2265248 dB/m. Conclusion: PNPLA3-G/G-genotype seems to double the risks of hepatic decompensation and (liver-related) mortality in patients with portal hypertension due to fatty liver disease. Further studies are warranted to investigate potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms unrelated to hepatic steatosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Fatty Liver", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Hypertension, Portal", "Lipase", "Liver Failure", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050557429", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55369068500": {"Name": "Mandorfer M.", "AuthorID": "55369068500", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55803009600": {"Name": "Scheiner B.", "AuthorID": "55803009600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "36769160400": {"Name": "St\u00e4ttermayer A.", "AuthorID": "36769160400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "35485391200": {"Name": "Schwabl P.", "AuthorID": "35485391200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56521656600": {"Name": "Paternostro R.", "AuthorID": "56521656600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57195487529": {"Name": "Bauer D.", "AuthorID": "57195487529", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004157033": {"Name": "Peck-Radosavljevic M.", "AuthorID": "7004157033", "AffiliationID": "116517752", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Endocrinology, and Nephrology, Klinikum Klagenfurt am Woerthersee"}, "7006061605": {"Name": "Trauner M.", "AuthorID": "7006061605", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24315181000": {"Name": "Reiberger T.", "AuthorID": "24315181000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7101836598": {"Name": "Ferenci P.", "AuthorID": "7101836598", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Internal Medicine III, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6603727095": {"Name": "Ferlitsch A.", "AuthorID": "6603727095", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Vienna Hepatic Hemodynamic Lab, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56248174400": {"Name": "Schaefer B.", "AuthorID": "56248174400", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine I, Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endocrinology, Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "55366142100": {"Name": "Zoller H.", "AuthorID": "55366142100", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine I, Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endocrinology, Medical University of Innsbruck"}}}
