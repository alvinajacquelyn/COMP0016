Computer-aided diagnosis can aid human graders to cope with this mounting problem. We propose to use a 10-layer convolutional neural network to automatically, simultaneously segment and discriminate exudates, haemorrhages and micro-aneurysms. Input image is normalized before segmentation. The net is trained in two stages to improve performance. On average, our net on 30,275,903 effective points achieved a sensitivity of 0.8758 and 0.7158 for exudates and dark lesions on the CLEOPATRA database. It also achieved a sensitivity of 0.6257 and 0.4606 for haemorrhages and micro-aneurysms. This study shows that it is possible to get a single convolutional neural network to segment these pathological features on a wide range of fundus images with reasonable accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Convolutional neural network", "Diabetic retinopathy", "Exudates", "Fundus image", "Haemorrhages", "Microaneurysms", "Segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Convolutional neural network", "Diabetic retinopathy", "Exudates", "Fundus image", "Haemorrhages", "Microaneurysms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027565220", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"26644487800": {"Name": "Tan J.H.", "AuthorID": "26644487800", "AffiliationID": "60012607", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Ngee Ann Polytechnic"}, "23134713400": {"Name": "Chua K.C.", "AuthorID": "23134713400", "AffiliationID": "60012607", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Ngee Ann Polytechnic"}, "7004510847": {"Name": "Acharya U.R.", "AuthorID": "7004510847", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya"}, "35611951900": {"Name": "Fujita H.", "AuthorID": "35611951900", "AffiliationID": "60011157", "AffiliationName": "Iwate Prefectural University, Faculty of Software and Information Science"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}, "14419627700": {"Name": "Bhandary S.V.", "AuthorID": "14419627700", "AffiliationID": "60015855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Kasturba Medical College"}, "57193714175": {"Name": "Rao A.K.", "AuthorID": "57193714175", "AffiliationID": "60015855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Kasturba Medical College"}}}
