For secondary-school students in England, confidence expressed as self-concept was most strongly predicted by (intrinsic) interest, perceived encouragement (praise), and subject-comparisons for mathematics, and by praise, interest, and peer-comparisons for science, controlling for achievement and various other factors. The students' reported subject-comparisons, peer-comparisons, anxiety, interest, and (extrinsic) utility differentially predicted the self-concept beliefs of under-confident, accurate, and over-confident students in various ways. For example, for mathematics, higher utility predicted higher self-concept when over-confident (but not when under-confident). For science, lower subject-comparisons (science thought to be harder than any other subject) predicted lower self-concept when under-confident (but not when over-confident). Understanding what predicts someone's self-concept when they are under-confident or over-confident may help these confidence biases to be corrected by educators or even by the students themselves.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calibration", "Confidence bias", "Self-concept", "Self-enhancement", "TIMSS"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979655989", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"55962835400": {"Name": "Sheldrake R.", "AuthorID": "55962835400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
