The CASP-19 proposes wellbeing as the satisfaction of four \u2018needs\u2019 (control, autonomy, self-realisation and pleasure). The CASP-19 may reflect the asses-based approach and has been validated in over 20 countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CASP-19's psychometric properties in older adults with dementia. Methods: An observational study was conducted at five NHS trusts across England. Participants were asked to either complete the CASP-19 by interview or self-report, alongside four other measures to assess psychometric properties. Results: Internal consistency overall was good (\u03b1 =.856) but the autonomy subscale fell below the acceptable. The CASP-19 was significantly correlated in the expected direction with measures of quality of life (r =.707), depression (r = \u2212.707) and additional measures. It also remained moderately stable over a one-week period but factor analyses indicated a 12-item measure may be more robust. Conclusions: Despite some variations, the CASP-19 appears to have adequate psychometric properties for older adults with dementia and can be used in future research and practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's", "CASP-19", "dementia", "outcome measurement", "positive psychology", "psychometric", "quality of life", "reliability", "validity", "wellbeing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Personal Autonomy", "Personal Satisfaction", "Pleasure", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Life", "Self-Control"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040971783", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56868402000": {"Name": "Stoner C.R.", "AuthorID": "56868402000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
