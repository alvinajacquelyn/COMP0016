This article considers the use of ivory and the long-term relationship between humans and elephants in one area, Mawogola, in south-western Uganda. Its scope extends from the initial encounters with elephants around 1,000 years ago, including the use of ivory as ornamentation, through the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century engagement of African states with the ivory trade, into colonial times and the end of the elephant in Mawogola in the late 1960s. Humans constructed their relationships with one another in part through the manipulation of ivory and elephants. Consideration is also given to the ecological impact of elephants and to the implications of their demise on the landscape.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ecology", "Elephant", "ivory", "Mawogola", "Ntuusi", "Uganda"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930087580", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"7202690863": {"Name": "Reid A.", "AuthorID": "7202690863", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
