In vitro studies have suggested that cells from adult choroid plexus have stem/progenitor cell-like properties. Our initial aim was to investigate whether such a cell population is present in vivo during development of the choroid plexus, focusing mainly on the chick choroid plexus. Cells expressing neural markers were indeed present in the choroid plexus of chick and also those of rodent and human embryos, both within their epithelium and mesenchyme. \u00df3-tubulin-positive cells with neuronal morphology could be detected as early as at E8 in chick choroid plexus and their morphological complexity increased with development. Whole mount immunochemistry demonstrated the presence of neurons throughout choroid plexus development and they appeared to be mainly catecholaminergic, as indicated by tyrosine-hydroxylase reactivity. The presence of cells co-labeling for BrdU and the neuroblast marker, doublecortin, in organotypic choroid plexus cultures supported the hypothesis that neurogenesis can occur from neural precursors within the developing choroid plexus. Furthermore, we found that extrinsic innervation is present in the developing choroid plexus, unlike previously suggested. Altogether, our data are consistent with the presence of neural progenitors within the choroid plexus, suggest that at least some of the choroid plexus neurons are born locally, and show for the first time that choroid plexus innervation occurs prenatally. Hence, we propose the existence of a complex neural regulatory network within the developing choroid plexus that may play a crucial role in modulating its function during development as well as throughout life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chick", "Choroid plexus", "Development", "Innervation", "Neural stem cell", "Neurogenesis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928119120", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55177179400": {"Name": "Prasongchean W.", "AuthorID": "55177179400", "AffiliationID": "60028190", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University"}, "23006893700": {"Name": "Vernay B.", "AuthorID": "23006893700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56600657200": {"Name": "Asgarian Z.", "AuthorID": "56600657200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56600840900": {"Name": "Jannatul N.", "AuthorID": "56600840900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35583510100": {"Name": "Ferretti P.", "AuthorID": "35583510100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
