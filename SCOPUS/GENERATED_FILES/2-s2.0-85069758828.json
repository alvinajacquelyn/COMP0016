In this paper, a superhydrophobic surface was fabricated by aerosol-assisted layer-by-layer chemical vapor deposition (AA-LbL-CVD) of epoxy resins and PDMS polymer films. The obtained samples still showed superhydrophobicity even after long-term exposure to different pH solutions and UV light irradiation as well as great mechanical stability against sandpaper abrasion and double-sided tape peeling. Importantly, due to the shape memory effect of the polymer films, the as-prepared samples could recover the previously crushed micro-nano structures upon heat treatment to make the surface superhydrophobic, showing thermo-triggered healing of superhydrophobicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Long term exposure", "Micro-nano structures", "Robust superhydrophobic surfaces", "Roughness structures", "Super-hydrophobic surfaces", "Superhydrophobicity", "Triggered healing", "UV-light irradiation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069758828", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57215784681": {"Name": "Guo X.J.", "AuthorID": "57215784681", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "15066222400": {"Name": "Xue C.H.", "AuthorID": "15066222400", "AffiliationID": "60069726", "AffiliationName": "College of Bioresources Chemical and Materials Engineering, Shaanxi University of Science and Technology"}, "37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "19337695800": {"Name": "Page K.", "AuthorID": "19337695800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56456916900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56456916900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54584049700": {"Name": "Promdet P.", "AuthorID": "54584049700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57203344268": {"Name": "Heale F.L.", "AuthorID": "57203344268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
