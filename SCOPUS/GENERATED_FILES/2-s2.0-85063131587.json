Both shifts - the perception of health problems through the framework of global health security and the corresponding technological approaches - imply epistemological changes, methodological ambivalences as well as manifold societal effects. Bringing current findings from social sciences and public health praxis into a dialogue, this conversation style contribution points out several broader implications of changing disease surveillance. The conversation covers epidemiological issues such as the shift from expert knowledge to algorithmic knowledge, the securitization of global health, and the construction of new kinds of threats. Those developments are detailed and discussed in their impacts for health provision in a broader sense.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Big data", "Digital epidemiology", "Global health", "Infectious disease", "Security"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Communicable Diseases", "Epidemiology", "Global Health", "Humans", "Interdisciplinary Communication", "Safety"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063131587", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"6602143805": {"Name": "Eckmanns T.", "AuthorID": "6602143805", "AffiliationID": "60016183", "AffiliationName": "Robert Koch Institute"}, "55191197800": {"Name": "F\u00fcller H.", "AuthorID": "55191197800", "AffiliationID": "60000762", "AffiliationName": "Geography Department, Humboldt-Universit\u00e4t zu Berlin"}, "57193200012": {"Name": "Roberts S.L.", "AuthorID": "57193200012", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Policy, London School of Economics (LSE)"}}}
