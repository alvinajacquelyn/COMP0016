This evidence synthesis, using realist review methodology, examined the role of group clinics in meeting the complex needs of young people living with diabetes. Following Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Synthesis\u2013Evolving Standards (RAMESES) quality standards, we conducted a systematic search across 10 databases. A total of 131 articles met inclusion criteria and were analyzed to develop theoretically informed explanations of how and why group clinics could work (or not) for young people with diabetes. Models of group-based care in the literature varied significantly and incorporated different degrees of clinical and educational content. Our analysis identified four overarching principles that can be applied in different contexts to drive sustained engagement of young people in group clinics: 1) emphasizing self-management as practical knowledge; 2) developing a sense of affinity between patients; 3) providing safe, developmentally appropriate care; and 4) balancing group and individual needs. Implementation of group clinics was not always straightforward; numerous adjustments to operational and clinical processes were required to establish and deliver high-quality care. Group clinics for young people with diabetes offer the potential to complement individualized care but are not a panacea and may generate as well as solve problems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Age of Onset", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "Humans", "Self-Management", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065115463", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"41461686300": {"Name": "Papoutsi C.", "AuthorID": "41461686300", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "24344105700": {"Name": "Greenhalgh T.", "AuthorID": "24344105700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "56118098000": {"Name": "Colligan G.", "AuthorID": "56118098000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "24166135400": {"Name": "Finer S.", "AuthorID": "24166135400", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7801319977": {"Name": "Hagell A.", "AuthorID": "7801319977", "AffiliationID": "116390917", "AffiliationName": "Association for Young People\u2019s Health"}, "40461756100": {"Name": "Hargreaves D.", "AuthorID": "40461756100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "7402449714": {"Name": "Marshall M.", "AuthorID": "7402449714", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "8294099500": {"Name": "Vijayaraghavan S.", "AuthorID": "8294099500", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
