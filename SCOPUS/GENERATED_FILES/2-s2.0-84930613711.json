All rights reserved.A 75-year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Symptoms started 10 years earlier but multiple investigations failed to offer a clear diagnosis. On recent admission, blood tests, endoscopies and CT scans indicated chronic colonic inflammation. Treatment strategies for bowel inflammation were unsuccessful and the patient was subsequently discussed at a multidisciplinary team meeting with surgeons for consideration of colectomy. A drug review highlighted that the patient was taking an antiangina drug, nicorandil, thought to cause bowel ulceration. This was discontinued, which dramatically improved symptoms and avoided surgery and the patient was discharged within days. Follow-up colonoscopy showed much improved colitis, and the diarrhoea had resolved. It is important that clinicians are aware of the link between pharmacotherapy, specifically nicorandil and gastrointestinal ulceration and inflammation causing severe diarrhoea. Drug cessation is the only necessary and immediately effective treatment. Awareness of this will become more clinically relevant as nicorandil use increases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Colitis", "Colonoscopy", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Nicorandil", "Vasodilator Agents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930613711", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56674332000": {"Name": "Samra K.", "AuthorID": "56674332000", "AffiliationID": "60004563", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals of North Midlands"}, "36499843200": {"Name": "Manikam L.", "AuthorID": "36499843200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602586188": {"Name": "Pathmakanthan S.", "AuthorID": "6602586188", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham"}}}
