Methods: an integrative review of studies published from January 2008 to December 2013, according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, in MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases were performed. Results: forty-seven fulltext studies including 14,624,492 older adults (\u2265 60 years) were analyzed: 24 (51.1%) concerning ADR, 14 (29.8%) DDI, and 9 studies (19.1%) investigating both DDI and ADR. We found a variety of methodological designs. The reviewed studies reinforced that polypharmacy is a multifactorial process, and predictors and inappropriate prescribing are associated with negative health outcomes, as increasing the frequency and types of ADRs and DDIs involving different drug classes, moreover, some studies show the most successful interventions to optimize prescribing. Conclusions: DDI and ADR among older adults continue to be a significant issue in the worldwide. The findings from the studies included in this integrative review, added to the previous reviews, can contribute to the improvement of advanced practices in geriatric nursing, to promote the safety of older patients in polypharmacy. However, more research is needed to elucidate gaps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aged", "Evidence-Based practice", "Polypharmacy", "Review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Drug Interactions", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Polypharmacy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989291118", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"55918311600": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "55918311600", "AffiliationID": "60024989", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Enfermagem, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade, Universidade de Bras\u00edlia"}, "7102223177": {"Name": "De Oliveira C.", "AuthorID": "7102223177", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Departament Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
