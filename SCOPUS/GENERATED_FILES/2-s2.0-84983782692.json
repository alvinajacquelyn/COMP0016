In this work, we use dual-frequency Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and incorporated with molecular modeling to quantify the ultrastructure and stiffness of the individual native collagen fibers from wildtype (+/+) and oim/oim diseased mice humeri. Our work presents direct experimental evidences that the +/+ fibers have highly organized and compact ultrastructure and corresponding ordered stiffness distribution. In contrast, oim/oim fibers have ordered but loosely packed ultrastructure with uncorrelated stiffness distribution, as well as local defects. The molecular model also demonstrates the structural and molecular packing differences between +/+ and oim/oim collagens. The molecular mutation significantly altered sub-fibril structure and mechanical property of collagen fibers. This study can give the new insight for the mechanisms and treatment of the brittle bone disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone", "Collagen", "Dual-frequency AFM", "Oim", "Stiffness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental evidence", "Fibril structure", "Level difference", "Molecular mutation", "Molecular packings", "Native collagen", "Osteogenesis imperfecta", "Stiffness distributions", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Amino Acids", "Collagen Type I", "Elastic Modulus", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Domains", "Stress, Mechanical", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983782692", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"57003828500": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "57003828500", "AffiliationID": "60026306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nebraska-Lincoln"}, "7101739307": {"Name": "Zeng K.", "AuthorID": "7101739307", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore"}, "56937324300": {"Name": "Chang S.W.", "AuthorID": "56937324300", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "7102467930": {"Name": "Buehler M.J.", "AuthorID": "7102467930", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "55539055900": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Florez N.", "AuthorID": "55539055900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "6507317962": {"Name": "Shefelbine S.", "AuthorID": "6507317962", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University"}, "7005492162": {"Name": "Dao M.", "AuthorID": "7005492162", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
