All rights reserved.The Global strategy for women\u2019s, children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 health (2016-2030) recognizes that people have a central role in improving their own health. We propose that community participation, particularly communities working together with health services (co-production in health care), will be central for achieving the objectives of the global strategy. Community participation specifically addresses the third of the key objectives: to transform societies so that women, children and adolescents can realize their rights to the highest attainable standards of health and well-being. In this paper, we examine what this implies in practice. We discuss three interdependent areas for action towards greater participation of the public in health: improving capabilities for individual and group participation; developing and sustaining people-centred health services; and social accountability. We outline challenges for implementation, and provide policy-makers, programme managers and practitioners with illustrative examples of the types of participatory approaches needed in each area to help achieve the health and development goals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Health", "Child", "Child Health", "Community Participation", "Developing Countries", "Health", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Patient-Centered Care", "Women's Health", "World Health Organization", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964781154", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56265831100": {"Name": "Marston C.", "AuthorID": "56265831100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "35279576300": {"Name": "Hinton R.", "AuthorID": "35279576300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56516530600": {"Name": "Kean S.", "AuthorID": "56516530600", "AffiliationID": "60077406", "AffiliationName": "World Vision International"}, "6602118888": {"Name": "Baral S.", "AuthorID": "6602118888", "AffiliationID": "100637176", "AffiliationName": "Health Research and Social Development Forum (HERD)"}, "56606773800": {"Name": "Ahuja A.", "AuthorID": "56606773800", "AffiliationID": "112343670", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health and Family Welfare, Government of Odisha"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization"}, "7007015219": {"Name": "Portela A.", "AuthorID": "7007015219", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization"}}}
