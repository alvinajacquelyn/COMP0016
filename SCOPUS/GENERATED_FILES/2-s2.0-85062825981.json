Amyloid plaques consist of fibrils of full length A\u03b2 peptides as well as N-terminally truncated species. \u03b2-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) cleaves amyloid precursor protein in the first step in A\u03b2 peptide production and is an attractive therapeutic target to limit A\u03b2 generation. Inhibition of BACE1, however, induces a unique pattern of A\u03b2 peptides with increased levels of N-terminally truncated A\u03b2 peptides starting at position 5 (A\u03b25-X), indicating that these peptides are generated through a BACE1-independent pathway. Here we elucidate the aggregation mechanism of A\u03b25-42 and its influence on full-length A\u03b242. We find that, compared to A\u03b242, A\u03b25-42 is more aggregation prone and displays enhanced nucleation rates. A\u03b25-42 oligomers cause nonspecific membrane disruption to similar extent as A\u03b242 but appear at earlier time points in the aggregation reaction. Noteworthy, this implies similar toxicity of A\u03b242 and A\u03b25-42 and the toxic species are generated faster by A\u03b25-42. The increased rate of secondary nucleation on the surface of existing fibrils originates from a higher affinity of A\u03b25-42 monomers for fibrils, as compared to A\u03b242: an effect that may be related to the reduced net charge of A\u03b25-42. Moreover, A\u03b25-42 and A\u03b242 peptides coaggregate into heteromolecular fibrils and either species can elongate existing A\u03b242 or A\u03b25-42 fibrils but A\u03b242 fibrils are more catalytic than A\u03b25-42 fibrils. Our findings highlight the importance of the N-terminus for surface-catalyzed nucleation and thus the production of toxic oligomers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggregation mechanism", "Alzheimer", "BACE", "coaggregation", "Misfolding", "toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases", "Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Nanoparticles", "Peptide Fragments", "Plaque, Amyloid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062825981", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57191825289": {"Name": "Weiffert T.", "AuthorID": "57191825289", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "16835982500": {"Name": "Dunning C.J.R.", "AuthorID": "16835982500", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "6603133907": {"Name": "Frohm B.", "AuthorID": "6603133907", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "7004924118": {"Name": "Linse S.", "AuthorID": "7004924118", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology, Lund University"}, "54795619000": {"Name": "Meisl G.", "AuthorID": "54795619000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Cambridge University"}, "56495561900": {"Name": "Flagmeier P.", "AuthorID": "56495561900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Cambridge University"}, "56623994700": {"Name": "Dobson C.M.", "AuthorID": "56623994700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Cambridge University"}, "14012356200": {"Name": "Knowles T.P.J.", "AuthorID": "14012356200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57207806243": {"Name": "De S.", "AuthorID": "57207806243", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Cambridge University"}, "7004374922": {"Name": "Klenerman D.", "AuthorID": "7004374922", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "120590429", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
