A ternary system of clinker-heavy metal-chlorine was developed that is more coincident with the condition of coprocessing of solid waste in cement kiln. The main goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among chlorine, volatilization and solidification of Cu/Pb, and the mineral phases of the clinker during clinkerization. The AlCl3\u00b76H2O (chlorine source) and PbO/CuO were mixed with cement raw meal in appropriate ratios to produce coprocessed clinkers. The volatilization and solidification of Pb and Cu were investigated experimentally using a combination of atomic absorption spectrometry, electron probe microanalysis, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, optical microscope, and thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction quantitative analyses. The volatilization ratios of Pb and Cu increased up to 46.18% and 34.04%, respectively, with increasing AlCl3\u00b76H2O content up to 1.6% compared to the cement mixtures without AlCl3\u00b76H2O addition (Pb and Cu volatilization ratios are 49.90% and 27.21%, respectively). Pb and Cu oxides can be transformed into Pb and Cu chlorides that are not stable and that have high vapor pressure. Pb and Cu are mainly concentrated in the interstitial phases of the clinker. The addition of AlCl3\u00b76H2O led to the increase of the crystal size of alite and belite. X-ray diffraction quantitative analyses proved that the content of silicate phase increased with the corresponding content of interstitial phases decreasing during clinkerization with the addition of AlCl3\u00b76H2O that decreased the ability of the clinker to solidify Pb and Cu in the produced clinkers. This research can help to promote understanding of the fate of heavy metals during the cement kiln coprocessing of solid wastes and can be meaningful for energy conservation and sustainable development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cement mixtures", "Cement raw meal", "Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy", "Mineral phasis", "Silicate phase", "Thermo-gravimetric", "Volatilisation", "Volatilization ratio"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048489648", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"57191293693": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "57191293693", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology"}, "14059371300": {"Name": "Wei J.", "AuthorID": "14059371300", "AffiliationID": "117879085", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Low Carbon Technologies Engineering Center for Building Materials"}, "55487630200": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "55487630200", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology"}, "57202461687": {"Name": "Zeng Z.", "AuthorID": "57202461687", "AffiliationID": "60024542", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology"}, "55649760700": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "55649760700", "AffiliationID": "117879085", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Low Carbon Technologies Engineering Center for Building Materials"}, "7402947710": {"Name": "Yu Q.", "AuthorID": "7402947710", "AffiliationID": "117879085", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Low Carbon Technologies Engineering Center for Building Materials"}, "22952845400": {"Name": "Bogush A.", "AuthorID": "22952845400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Resource Efficiency and the Environment (CREE), Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), University College London (UCL), Chadwick Building"}, "7005025101": {"Name": "Stegemann J.", "AuthorID": "7005025101", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Resource Efficiency and the Environment (CREE), Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE), University College London (UCL), Chadwick Building"}}}
