The objectives are as follows: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography for detecting the presence or absence of cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease compared with liver biopsy as reference standard. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of any of the ultrasonography tests, B-mode or Echo-colour Doppler ultrasonography, used singly or combined, or plus ultrasonography signs, or a combination of these, for detecting hepatic cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease compared with liver biopsy as a reference standard, irrespective of sequence. If results differ, we will attempt to explore heterogeneity analysing: liver biopsy as the reference standard: different grade of inflammation (amount of ongoing inflammation and necrosis) according to the liver biopsy (below two grades compared to two or greater grades of activity); different lengths of liver biopsy sample (shorter than 15 mm compared to 15 mm or longer) or number of portal tracts (fewer than six compared to six or more), as reported in the studies; percutaneous liver biopsy versus transvenous (transjugular) liver biopsy versus laparoscopic liver biopsy; different technical characteristics of the ultrasonography equipment (e.g., different transducers, different wave lengths); different skills of the operator as stated by the authors; complete abstinent (teetotallers) or non-abstinent study participants (as defined in the included studies). different grade of inflammation (amount of ongoing inflammation and necrosis) according to the liver biopsy (below two grades compared to two or greater grades of activity); different lengths of liver biopsy sample (shorter than 15 mm compared to 15 mm or longer) or number of portal tracts (fewer than six compared to six or more), as reported in the studies; percutaneous liver biopsy versus transvenous (transjugular) liver biopsy versus laparoscopic liver biopsy; In addition, we will attempt to identify the most accurate ultrasonographic tests and indices for diagnosis of cirrhosis in people with alcoholic liver disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042048640", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57196355076": {"Name": "Pavlov C.S.", "AuthorID": "57196355076", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "I.M.
