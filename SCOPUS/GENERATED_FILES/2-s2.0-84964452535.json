Discoveries in plants and animals, as well as novel experimental approaches, have prompted the research community to reconsider established concepts and paradigms. This development was taken as an incentive to organise a workshop in May 2014 at the Academia Nazionale dei Lincei in Rome. There, experts on epigenetics, regeneration, neuroplasticity, and computational biology, using different animal and plant models, presented their insights on important aspects of a dynamic architecture of life, which comprises all organisational levels of the organism. Their work demonstrates that a dynamic nature of life persists during the entire existence of the organism and permits animals and plants not only to fine-tune their response to particular environmental demands during development, but underlies their continuous capacity to do so. Here, a synthesis of the different findings and their relevance for biological thinking is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964452535", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"36883768300": {"Name": "Rubin B.P.", "AuthorID": "36883768300", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60025858, 60099404", "AffiliationName": "Collegium Helveticum, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich"}, "7006470776": {"Name": "Brockes J.", "AuthorID": "7006470776", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7003929475": {"Name": "Galliot B.", "AuthorID": "7003929475", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics and Evolution, University of Geneva"}, "7004934482": {"Name": "Grossniklaus U.", "AuthorID": "7004934482", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and Zurich-Basel Plant Science Center, University of Zurich"}, "23985068300": {"Name": "Lobo D.", "AuthorID": "23985068300", "AffiliationID": "60024997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, University of Maryland, Baltimore County"}, "26424686300": {"Name": "Mainardi M.", "AuthorID": "26424686300", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Physiology, Catholic University"}, "14036042500": {"Name": "Mirouze M.", "AuthorID": "14036042500", "AffiliationID": "60028993", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement, UMR DIADE, Laboratoire G\u00e9nome et D\u00e9veloppement des Plantes"}, "57204318284": {"Name": "Prochiantz A.", "AuthorID": "57204318284", "AffiliationID": "115896508", "AffiliationName": "Chaire des Processus Morphog\u00e9n\u00e9tiques, Centre Interdisciplinaire de Recherche en Biologie"}, "7004636089": {"Name": "Steger A.", "AuthorID": "7004636089", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical Computer Science, ETH Zurich"}}}
