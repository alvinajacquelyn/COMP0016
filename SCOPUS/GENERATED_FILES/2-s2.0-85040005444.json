Following activation, they can function as professional antigen-presenting cells. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) work by focusing T cell function on defined cell surface tumor antigens and provide essential costimulation for robust activation. Given the natural tropism of \u03b3\u03b4T cells for the tumor microenvironment, we hypothesized that their transduction with CARs might enhance cytotoxicity while retaining their ability to migrate to tumor and act as antigen-presenting cells to prolong the intratumoral immune response. Using a GD2-targeting CAR as a model system, we showed that \u03b3\u03b4T cells of both V\u03b41 and V\u03b42 subsets could be expanded and transduced to sufficient numbers for clinical studies. The CAR added to the cells\u2019 innate cytotoxicity by enhancing GD2-specific killing of GD2-expressing cancer cell lines. Migration toward tumor cells in vitro was not impaired by the presence of the CAR. Expanded CAR-transduced V\u03b42 cells retained the ability to take up tumor antigens and cross presented the processed peptide to responder alpha beta T (\u03b1\u03b2T) lymphocytes. \u03b3\u03b4 CAR-T cell products show promise for evaluation in clinical studies of solid tumors. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been successfully expressed in human T cells to redirect their cytotoxic effector function against cancer antigens. A rare subset of T cells called gamma delta T cells is shown to be amenable to genetic modification by CARs and to retain the additional functional characteristic of antigen cross presentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chimeric antigen receptor", "cross presentation", "gamma delta T cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antigen Presentation", "Antigen-Presenting Cells", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "Biomarkers", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cross-Priming", "Cytotoxicity, Immunologic", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Phenotype", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta", "Receptors, Chimeric Antigen", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040005444", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"36624967100": {"Name": "Capsomidis A.", "AuthorID": "36624967100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57200159895": {"Name": "Benthall G.", "AuthorID": "57200159895", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "37053054900": {"Name": "Van Acker H.H.", "AuthorID": "37053054900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "56108105900": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "56108105900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57194501749": {"Name": "Majani Y.", "AuthorID": "57194501749", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57200166673": {"Name": "Gileadi T.", "AuthorID": "57200166673", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "7401496213": {"Name": "Wallace R.", "AuthorID": "7401496213", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "12770706300": {"Name": "Flutter B.", "AuthorID": "12770706300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "55731054400": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55731054400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57061688800": {"Name": "Kramer A.M.", "AuthorID": "57061688800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57200166118": {"Name": "Abeln Z.", "AuthorID": "57200166118", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "7005333544": {"Name": "Gustafsson K.", "AuthorID": "7005333544", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Section, University College London Institute of Child Health"}}}
