Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Assessing anxiety is an important part of the assessment of a child presenting for dental treatment; however, the use of dental anxiety scales in practice is not well-documented. Aims: To introduce child dental anxiety scales, and to monitor the extent to which dentists used them; to explore the experience and views of dentists regarding anxiety assessment. Design: A mixed-methods design was employed. Method: A protocol for child anxiety assessment was introduced to paediatric dentists in Eastman Dental Hospital. After 6 months, 100 patient files were audited to examine compliance with the protocol. Fourteen dentists were interviewed to explore their experience and views regarding anxiety assessment. Results: Only five patients were assessed using the scales. Thematic analysis of the dentist interviews revealed three themes: \u2018Clinical observations and experience: The gold standard\u2019; \u2018Scales as an estimate or adjunct\u2019; and \u2018Shortcomings and barriers to using scales\u2019. Conclusions: The dentists in our study did not use anxiety scales, instead they rely on their own experience/judgement. Therefore, scales should be recommended as an adjunct to judgement. Brief scales are recommended as clinicians lack time and expertise in administering anxiety questionnaires. Advantages of using scales and hands-on experience could be incorporated more in undergraduate training.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Dental Anxiety", "Humans", "Practice Patterns, Dentists'", "Psychological Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017529756", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57193932741": {"Name": "Alshammasi H.", "AuthorID": "57193932741", "AffiliationID": "60032813", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health"}, "7005512711": {"Name": "Buchanan H.", "AuthorID": "7005512711", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division Rehabilitation and Ageing, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7006826945": {"Name": "Ashley P.", "AuthorID": "7006826945", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL - Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
