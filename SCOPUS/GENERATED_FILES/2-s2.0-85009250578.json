The article begins by looking at the development of initial contact between Soviet officials and Mozambican nationalists. The middle-level Soviet officials involved had diverse personal trajectories, but many had prior experience in the international communist movement, and some had fought in the Second World War. These experiences shaped their commitment to ending colonial exploitation and their enthusiastic quest to support \u2018progressive\u2019 African nationalists. My account stresses the importance of key interlocutors in shaping initial Eastern-bloc officials\u2019 decisions over which movements to support \u2013 emphasising in particular the mediating role played by the trusted figure of Marcelino dos Santos. Dos Santos used his connections with Eastern-bloc countries to facilitate both Frelimo\u2019s rise over rival nationalist movements and Eduardo Mondlane\u2019s ascendance as Frelimo leader. The Frelimo leadership\u2019s successful pursuit of assistance from socialist countries in 1964\u201365 shows their capacity to leverage the Cold War to their own advantage. The article argues that the Mozambicans in this story, rather than following Moscow\u2019s diktat, were the agents of their own emancipation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009250578", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57192938521": {"Name": "Telepneva N.", "AuthorID": "57192938521", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies, University College"}}}
