This paper thus identifies and explores a relevant collaborative organization, the social innovation community (SIC). Found in cosmopolitan cities, SICs are held together by recognizable shared cultures and online/offline spaces. This account sets out a basic categorization of SICs, profiles their salient features, and offers an original definition. SICs support early-stage social entrepreneurship but may also help to introduce social innovation into new cultural settings, re-programme wider innovation circuits, and promote productive collaboration amid diversity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collaboration", "innovation community", "networks", "social entrepreneurship", "Social innovation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952717249", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"36783709600": {"Name": "Toivonen T.", "AuthorID": "36783709600", "AffiliationID": "60103891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Financial & Management Studies, SOAS, University of London"}}}
