In this report, we generate a DNA nanopore based on the archetypal six-helix-bundle architecture and systematically characterize it via single-channel current recordings to address several fundamental scientific questions in this emerging field. We establish that the DNA pores exhibit two voltage-dependent conductance states. Low transmembrane voltages favor a stable high-conductance level, which corresponds to an unobstructed DNA pore. The expected inner width of the open channel is confirmed by measuring the conductance change as a function of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) size, whereby smaller PEGs are assumed to enter the pore. PEG sizing also clarifies that the main ion-conducting path runs through the membrane-spanning channel lumen as opposed to any proposed gap between the outer pore wall and the lipid bilayer. At higher voltages, the channel shows a main low-conductance state probably caused by electric-field-induced changes of the DNA pore in its conformation or orientation. This voltage-dependent switching between the open and closed states is observed with planar lipid bilayers as well as bilayers mounted on glass nanopipettes. These findings settle a discrepancy between two previously published conductances. By systematically exploring a large space of parameters and answering key questions, our report supports the development of DNA nanopores for nanobiotechnology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bilayer membrane", "DNA nanotechnology", "nanofluidics", "nanopore", "PEG", "single-molecule"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bilayer membranes", "Conductance state", "DNA nanotechnology", "Electric field-induced changes", "Membrane spanning", "Single molecule", "Transmembrane voltage", "Voltage-dependent conductance", "Cell Membrane", "DNA", "Electric Conductivity", "Lipid Bilayers", "Molecular Conformation", "Nanopores", "Polyethylene Glycols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923448347", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56245786300": {"Name": "Seifert A.", "AuthorID": "56245786300", "AffiliationID": "60116286", "AffiliationName": "Nanion Technologies GmbH"}, "6603432990": {"Name": "Fertig N.", "AuthorID": "6603432990", "AffiliationID": "60116286", "AffiliationName": "Nanion Technologies GmbH"}, "55550545200": {"Name": "G\u00f6pfrich K.", "AuthorID": "55550545200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "22134881300": {"Name": "Keyser U.", "AuthorID": "22134881300", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "37087024100": {"Name": "Burns J.", "AuthorID": "37087024100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "8389134100": {"Name": "Howorka S.", "AuthorID": "8389134100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
