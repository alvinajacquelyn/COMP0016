Here, using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) adaptation paradigm, we show that the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) (corresponding to the supramarginal gyrus) exhibited reduction in neural activity due to adaptation when a visual stimulus of the same duration was repeatedly presented. Adaptation was strongest when stimuli of identical durations were repeated, and it gradually decreased as the difference between the reference and test durations increased. This tuning property generalized across a broad range of durations, indicating the presence of general time-representation mechanisms in the IPL. Furthermore, adaptation was observed irrespective of the subject\u2019s attention to time. Repetition of a nontemporal aspect of the stimulus (i.e., shape) did not produce neural adaptation in the IPL. These results provide neural evidence for duration-tuned representations in the human brain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Discrimination (Psychology)", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Parietal Lobe", "Temporal Lobe", "Time Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943145847", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"36794634600": {"Name": "Hayashi M.J.", "AuthorID": "36794634600", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, University of Helsinki"}, "35570064300": {"Name": "Kanai R.", "AuthorID": "35570064300", "AffiliationID": "60170327", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinformatics, Araya Brain Imaging"}, "39861411400": {"Name": "Ditye T.", "AuthorID": "39861411400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7005240472": {"Name": "Walsh V.", "AuthorID": "7005240472", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7201543818": {"Name": "Carlson S.", "AuthorID": "7201543818", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, University of Helsinki"}, "23477063400": {"Name": "Harada T.", "AuthorID": "23477063400", "AffiliationID": "60022015", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cerebral Integration, National Institute for Physiological Sciences"}, "56285249600": {"Name": "Hashiguchi M.", "AuthorID": "56285249600", "AffiliationID": "60021523", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiological Sciences, The Graduate University for Advanced Studies"}, "7004689606": {"Name": "Sadato N.", "AuthorID": "7004689606", "AffiliationID": "60010848", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Imaging Research Center, University of Fukui"}}}
