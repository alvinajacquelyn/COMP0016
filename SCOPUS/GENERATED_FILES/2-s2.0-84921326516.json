All rights reserved.Graphene transparent conductive films have been proposed as indium tin oxide (ITO) modifiers for application in optoelectronic devices. Here thermal and chemical treatments of graphene-based transparent films are systematically investigated with a view to increasing their conductivity and tuning their work function. We look at two different types of graphene, obtained either via spin-coating of graphene oxide (GO) aqueous dispersions, or vacuum-filtration of liquid-phase exfoliated (LPE) graphene in highly volatile, non-toxic solvents such as isopropanol and ethanol. As-deposited films are relatively resistive, but we are able to lower their sheet resistance by up to three orders of magnitude for both LPE and GO, so as to reach values of \u223c105 \u03a9/\u25a1 via thermal treatments at temperatures of \u223c350/400\u00b0C at pressures of \u223c10-6/10-4 mbar. Most importantly, the physisorption of the molecule (CF3SO2)2NH (trifluoromethanesulfonimide) results in an increase of the films work function by up to 0.5 eV, to yield a value of \u223c5.3 eV. This is comparable or slightly better than what can be achieved with poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), depending on PSS concentration, thereby confirming the potentially beneficial role of chemical doping of liquid dispersions of graphene-derivatives for application to organic electronics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Doping", "Graphene", "Graphene oxide", "Liquid-phase exfoliated graphene", "Work function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aqueous dispersions", "Chemical treatments", "Exfoliated graphene", "Organic electronics", "Poly(3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)", "Poly(styrene sulfonate)", "Three orders of magnitude", "Transparent conductive films"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921326516", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"26038028100": {"Name": "Bausi F.", "AuthorID": "26038028100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55505117700": {"Name": "Schlierf A.", "AuthorID": "55505117700", "AffiliationID": "60019442, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto per la Sintesi Organica e la Fotoreattivit\u00e0, Centro Nazionale Delle Ricerche (CNR)"}, "25957811000": {"Name": "Treossi E.", "AuthorID": "25957811000", "AffiliationID": "60019442, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto per la Sintesi Organica e la Fotoreattivit\u00e0, Centro Nazionale Delle Ricerche (CNR)"}, "8682320300": {"Name": "Palermo V.", "AuthorID": "8682320300", "AffiliationID": "60019442, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto per la Sintesi Organica e la Fotoreattivit\u00e0, Centro Nazionale Delle Ricerche (CNR)"}, "8886952400": {"Name": "Schwab M.G.", "AuthorID": "8886952400", "AffiliationID": "60007616", "AffiliationName": "BASF SE, Carbon Materials Innovation Center"}}}
