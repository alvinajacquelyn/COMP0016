In this region, complex interactions between the Arabian, Eurasian and Anatolian plates occur at the Karl\u0131ova Triple Junction (KTJ). The relationship between tectonics and magma propagation in triple-junction tectonic settings is poorly understood. Here we present new field and numerical results on the mechanism of magma propagation at the KTJ. We explore the effects of crustal heterogeneity and anisotropy, in particular the geometry and mechanical properties of many faults and layers, on magma propagation paths under a variety of tectonic loadings. We propose that two major volcanic centres in the area, the Turnada\u011f volcano and the Varto caldera, are both fed by comparatively shallow magma chambers at depths of about 8 km, which, in turn, are fed by a single, much larger and deeper reservoir at about 15\u201318 km depth. By contrast, the nearby \u00d6zen\u00e7 volcanic area is fed directly by the deeper reservoir. We present a series of two-dimensional and three-dimensional numerical models showing that the present tectonic stresses encourage magma-chamber rupture and dyke injection. The results show that inversion tectonics encourages the formation of magma paths as potential feeder dykes. Our three-dimensional models allow us to explore the local stresses induced by complex loading conditions at the Karl\u0131ova triple junction, using an approach that can in future be applied to other similar tectonic regions. The numerical results indicate a great complexity in the potential magma (dyke) paths, resulting from local stresses generated by interaction between mechanical layers, major faults, and magma chambers. In particular, the results suggest three main controls on magma path formation and eventual eruptions at KTJ: (1) the geometry and attitude of the associated faults; (2) the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the crust; and (3) mechanical (stress) interactions between deep and shallow magma chambers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dyke propagation", "Eastern Turkey", "numerical modelling", "triple-junction tectonics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Eastern Turkey", "Inversion tectonics", "Magma chamber ruptures", "Numerical results", "Tectonic settings", "Three-dimensional model", "Three-dimensional numerical models", "Triple junction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982132641", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55891275300": {"Name": "Karao\u011flu \u00d6.", "AuthorID": "55891275300", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}, "56494287000": {"Name": "Browning J.", "AuthorID": "56494287000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56668506300": {"Name": "Bazargan M.", "AuthorID": "56668506300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7006484042": {"Name": "Gudmundsson A.", "AuthorID": "7006484042", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}}}
