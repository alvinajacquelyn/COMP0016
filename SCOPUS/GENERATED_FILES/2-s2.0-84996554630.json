Although the crude oil itself is not corrosive the presence of water and dissolved gasses such as CO2 and H2S can potentially result in internal corrosion. It is well known that the corrosion occurs if a continuous layer of corrosive water wet the pipe. However, past experiences revealed that the probability of water wetting critically depends on the oil properties. Due to the complex nature of oil-water flows predicting the phase behavior under different conditions is a challenging task. Hence, any progress in developing a reliable method for predicting the onset of water wetting and the characteristics of corrosive water layer can significantly increase the accuracy of corrosion prediction as well as the confidence regarding the integrity of the pipelines. The present study is an attempt toward using computational fluid dynamics for studying the effect of oil properties on the sweet corrosion. To this end, an Eulerian-Eulerian approach along with population balance model is employed. Furthermore, the capability of model in predicting the main features of oil water flow and the effect of different crude oils on water wetting and corrosion rate are investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous layers", "Corrosion prediction", "Corrosive water", "Eulerian-Eulerian approach", "Internal corrosion", "Population balance modeling", "Presence of water", "Reliable methods"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996554630", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"36634743500": {"Name": "Pouraria H.", "AuthorID": "36634743500", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "36890591400": {"Name": "Seo J.", "AuthorID": "36890591400", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Ship and Offshore Research Institute, Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
