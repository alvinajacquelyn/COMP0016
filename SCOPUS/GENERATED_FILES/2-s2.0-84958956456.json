University students with ASD and matched control participants performed the Social Strategy task. In this, they read a range of descriptions of social interactions, all ending with an awkward question asked by the story main character. The types of strategies they used to answer the awkward questions were examined. Compared to control participants, those with ASD used a more negative emotional tone in responding, generated more simple strategies including acquiescence or refusal, and fewer sophisticated strategies that considered all parties' perspectives. In a novel task condition, participants rank-ordered simple and sophisticated strategies, and gave justifications for their use. Rank-ordering did not differentiate the groups. Justifications given by those with ASD for simple strategies were more practical and less often character-based than those given by control participants; the groups did not differ in the justifications given for sophisticated strategies. The possible explanations of these findings and implications for informing current intervention programmes are considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder", "Empathy", "Mentalising", "Social cognition", "Social knowledge", "Social skill"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958956456", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56029263500": {"Name": "Bellesi G.", "AuthorID": "56029263500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Experimental Psychology"}, "56030184400": {"Name": "Jameel L.", "AuthorID": "56030184400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Experimental Psychology"}, "56030501300": {"Name": "Vyas K.", "AuthorID": "56030501300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Experimental Psychology"}, "7202193869": {"Name": "Crawford S.", "AuthorID": "7202193869", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Experimental Psychology"}, "7006607949": {"Name": "Channon S.", "AuthorID": "7006607949", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Experimental Psychology"}}}
