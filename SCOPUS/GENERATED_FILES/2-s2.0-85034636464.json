While multibranched gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have emerged as a promising modality in the photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancers, some of the key challenges limiting their clinical translation lie in the need to develop reproducible and cost-effective synthetic methods as well as the selective accumulation of sufficient AuNPs at tumor sites. In this study, we report a simple and direct seed-mediated synthesis of monodispersed multibranched AuNPs using the catechol-containing LAT-1 ligands, L- and D-dopa, to confer active cancer targeting. This route obviates the need for additional conjugation with targeting moieties such as peptides or antibodies. Nanoflower-like AuNPs (AuNF) with diameters of approximately 46, 70, and 90 nm were obtained and were found to possess excellent colloidal stability and biocompatibility. A significantly higher intracellular accumulation of the L- and D-dopa functionalized AuNFs was observed in a panel of breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-453) when compared to the nontargeting control AuNFs synthesized with dopamine and 4-ethylcatechol. Importantly, no significant difference in uptake between the targeting and nontargeting AuNFs was observed in a non-tumorigenic MCF-10A breast epithelial cell line, hence demonstrating tumor selectivity. For PTT of breast cancer, Ag+ was introduced during synthesis to obtain L-dopa functionalized nanourchin-like AuNPs (AuNUs) with strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance. The L-dopa functionalized AuNUs mediated selective photothermal ablation of the triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and sensitized the cells to the anticancer drugs cisplatin and docetaxel. This work brings forward an effective strategy for the facile preparation of cancer targeting multibranched AuNPs with potential for the in vivo PTT of breast cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer targeting", "catechol", "gold nanoparticle", "large neutral amino acid transporter-1", "photothermal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino acid transporter", "Cancer-targeting", "catechol", "Gold Nanoparticles", "Photo-thermal", "Breast Neoplasms", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Gold", "Humans", "MCF-7 Cells", "Metal Nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034636464", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"26022495600": {"Name": "Ong Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "26022495600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Leeds"}, "57059562100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "57059562100", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "54882406000": {"Name": "Regoutz A.", "AuthorID": "54882406000", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "56785104500": {"Name": "Payne D.J.", "AuthorID": "56785104500", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "6603852929": {"Name": "Dunlop I.E.", "AuthorID": "6603852929", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7202005226": {"Name": "Porter A.E.", "AuthorID": "7202005226", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "56619274200": {"Name": "Nabavi E.", "AuthorID": "56619274200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7005533698": {"Name": "Elson D.S.", "AuthorID": "7005533698", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Hamlyn Centre, Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7006330956": {"Name": "Dexter D.T.", "AuthorID": "7006330956", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's Disease Research Unit, Centre for Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}}}
