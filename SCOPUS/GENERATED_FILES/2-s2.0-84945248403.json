However, in most cases it only provides anatomical detail and does not provide any form of tissue characterisation. This is particularly true for X-ray imaging. Recent studies on tissue diffraction have shown that true molecular signatures can be derived for different tissue types. Breast cancer samples and liver tissue have been studied. It has been shown that diffraction profiles can be traced away from the primary tumour in excised breast tissue samples and that potentially 3mm fat nodules in liver tissue can be identified in patients at acceptable doses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Cancer", "Breast tissues", "Diffraction profiles", "Diffraction studies", "Molecular signatures", "Patient management", "Tissue types", "Xray imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945248403", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57205908360": {"Name": "Speller R.", "AuthorID": "57205908360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "56925574500": {"Name": "Abuchi S.", "AuthorID": "56925574500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "55633752000": {"Name": "Zheng Y.", "AuthorID": "55633752000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "36127143900": {"Name": "Vassiljev N.", "AuthorID": "36127143900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "56216563500": {"Name": "Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "56216563500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, UCL"}, "26026005600": {"Name": "Konstantinidis A.", "AuthorID": "26026005600", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology and Radiation Protection, Christie Medical Physics and Engineering, Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
