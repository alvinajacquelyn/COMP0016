Although techniques have been previously introduced to delineate lesions from mpMRI, these techniques were evaluated in datasets with T2 maps available. The generation of T2 map is not included in the clinical prostate mpMRI consensus guidelines; the acquisition of which requires repeated T2-weighted (T2W) scans and would significantly lengthen the scan time currently required for the clinically recommended acquisition protocol, which includes T2W, diffusion-weighted (DW), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. The goal of this study is to develop and evaluate an algorithm that provides pixel-accurate lesion delineation from images acquired based on the clinical protocol. Methods: Twenty-five pixel-based features were extracted from the T2-weighted (T2W), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images. The pixel-wise classification was performed on the reduced space generated by locality alignment discriminant analysis (LADA), a version of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) localized to patches in the feature space. Postprocessing procedures, including the removal of isolated points identified and filling of holes inside detected regions, were performed to improve delineation accuracy. The segmentation result was evaluated against the lesions manually delineated by four expert observers according to the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) detection guideline. Results: The LADA-based classifier (60 \u00b1 11%) achieved a higher sensitivity than the LDA-based classifier (51 \u00b1 10%), thereby demonstrating, for the first time, that higher classification performance was attained on the reduced space generated by LADA than by LDA. Further sensitivity improvement (75 \u00b1 14%) was obtained after postprocessing, approaching the sensitivities attained by previous mpMRI lesion delineation studies in which nonclinical T2 maps were available. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm delineated lesions accurately and efficiently from images acquired following the clinical protocol. The development of this framework may potentially accelerate the clinical uses of mpMRI in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer lesion delineation", "locality alignment discriminant analysis (LADA)", "multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)", "prostate cancer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apparent diffusion coefficient", "cancer lesion delineation", "Classification performance", "Detection and localization", "Linear discriminant analysis", "locality alignment discriminant analysis (LADA)", "multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)", "Prostate cancers", "Algorithms", "Discriminant Analysis", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Linear Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053489884", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57194463873": {"Name": "Lin M.", "AuthorID": "57194463873", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56469947000": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "56469947000", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55505516700": {"Name": "Chow T.W.S.", "AuthorID": "55505516700", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong"}, "7006514425": {"Name": "Chiu B.", "AuthorID": "7006514425", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55143406500": {"Name": "Zhao M.", "AuthorID": "55143406500", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "School of Information Science and Technology, Donghua University"}, "36026807300": {"Name": "Gibson E.", "AuthorID": "36026807300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35387374400": {"Name": "Bastian-Jordan M.", "AuthorID": "35387374400", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Imaging, University of Western Ontario"}, "14022373100": {"Name": "Cool D.W.", "AuthorID": "14022373100", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Imaging, University of Western Ontario"}, "13613283600": {"Name": "Kassam Z.", "AuthorID": "13613283600", "AffiliationID": "60026135", "AffiliationName": "Lawson Health Research Institute"}, "8590897600": {"Name": "Ward A.D.", "AuthorID": "8590897600", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Western Ontario"}, "55968572900": {"Name": "Liang H.", "AuthorID": "55968572900", "AffiliationID": "60001193, 60025761, 60121944", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology"}}}
