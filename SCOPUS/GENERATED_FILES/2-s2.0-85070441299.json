All Rights Reserved.PURPOSE. Endothelial cell density (ECD) is the principal factor determining the success of corneal transplants. Here we explored a strategy to increase corneal ECD in human explants via modulation of the ZO-1/ZONAB pathway. In multiple cell types, ZO-1 maintains G1 cell cycle arrest via cytoplasmic sequestration of the mitosis-inducing transcription factor ZONAB. In this study, we assessed the effects of lentiviral vector-mediated downregulation of ZO-1 or overexpression of ZONAB upon ECD and the integrity of the endothelial monolayer. METHODS. HIV-based lentiviral vectors were used to deliver either constitutively expressed ZONAB (LNT-ZONAB), or a small hairpin RNA targeting ZO-1 (LNT-shZO1). Human corneal specimens were bisected and each half was exposed to either treatment or control vector. After 1 week in ex vivo culture, effects were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and ECD assessment. RESULTS. LNT-shZO1 achieved an ~45% knockdown of ZO-1 mRNA in corneal endothelial cells cultured ex vivo, reduced ZO-1 staining, and did not affect morphologic endothelial monolayer integrity. The proliferative effect of LNT-shZO1 correlated with control ECD but not with donor age. Within a low-ECD cohort an ~30% increase in ECD was observed. LNT-ZONAB achieved a >200-fold overexpression of ZONAB mRNA, which led to an ~25% increase in ECD. CONCLUSIONS. ZO-1 downregulation or ZONAB upregulation increases corneal ECD via interference with contact inhibition and cell cycle control. With further development, such approaches might provide a means for improving ECD in donor corneas before transplantation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell proliferation", "corneal endothelial cells", "gene therapy", "ZO-1/ZONAB"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Count", "Cells, Cultured", "Contact Inhibition", "Corneal Diseases", "Corneal Transplantation", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Humans", "RNA, Messenger", "Signal Transduction", "Zonula Occludens-1 Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070441299", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"23569191300": {"Name": "Kampik D.", "AuthorID": "23569191300", "AffiliationID": "60032515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital of W\u00a8urzburg, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "26634710800": {"Name": "Basche M.", "AuthorID": "26634710800", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701653389": {"Name": "Georgiadis A.", "AuthorID": "6701653389", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "9532683500": {"Name": "Luhmann U.F.", "AuthorID": "9532683500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57203012241": {"Name": "Smith A.J.", "AuthorID": "57203012241", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7005642367": {"Name": "Larkin D.F.", "AuthorID": "7005642367", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
