Materials and Methods A retrospective review was undertaken of 44 patients (21 men, 23 women; median age, 66 y; range, 17-89 y) who underwent 62 sessions of high-energy MWA for 87 pulmonary tumors at a single tertiary referral center between June 2012 and June 2014. Primary tumor origin was sarcoma (n = 23), colorectal (n = 16), lung (n = 2), esophageal (n = 1), breast (n = 1), and bladder (n = 1). Median tumor size was 12 mm (range, 6-45 mm). Technical success was recorded contemporaneously, complication rate at 30 days was recorded prospectively, and technique effectiveness was assessed by longitudinal follow-up CT scan. Results Primary technical success was achieved in 94% of ablation sessions. The median follow-up interval was 15 months (range, 6.2-29.5 mo) during which time local tumor progression was observed in two of 87 tumors (technique effectiveness 98%). Pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion occurred in 19%; delayed pneumothorax occurred in four patients. No hemoptysis, infection, or other complications were recorded. Conclusions High-energy MWA is safe and effective for the destruction of lung tumors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Catheter Ablation", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "London", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Microwaves", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Treatment Outcome", "Tumor Burden", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961111690", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"25723136700": {"Name": "Egashira Y.", "AuthorID": "25723136700", "AffiliationID": "60165278, 60019983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University"}, "15754175900": {"Name": "Illing R.", "AuthorID": "15754175900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Interventional Oncology Service, University College London Hospital"}, "57183312200": {"Name": "Singh S.", "AuthorID": "57183312200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "35775945600": {"Name": "Bandula S.", "AuthorID": "35775945600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}}}
