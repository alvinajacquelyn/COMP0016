This study proposes a robust alternative to site-centric approaches, by examining spatial and technological variability in time-averaged deposits of artefacts collected from the modern surface of Misiones province, north-eastern Argentina. A family of spatial statistical techniques supported by Monte Carlo simulation identify statistically significant inhomogeneity and clustering in lithic point pattern data. This highlights interaction between technologically meaningful sub-samples of four assemblages, which is interpreted as reflecting long-term discard and association of distinctive reduction sequences. These are irreducible to individual episodes, demonstrating that partitioning palimpsests into sites poorly reflects record formation on a landscape level. This illustrates how explicit models of depositional trends can provide information on indigenous land use, and underlines the rich informative potential of surface archaeology in tropical settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argentina", "Lithic technology", "Spatial analysis", "Surface archaeology", "Survey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009726490", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"56534085900": {"Name": "Riris P.", "AuthorID": "56534085900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
