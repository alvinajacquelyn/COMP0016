In order to quantify the accuracy of our framework against experimentally-derived NVS data from previous work, we also propose and validate two metrics, the Chamfer distance and e-repeatability. The most important application of PIX2NVS will be in the generation of artificial NVS from large annotated video frame collections used in machine learning research, e.g., YouTube-8M, YFCC100m, YouTube-BoundingBoxes, thereby transferring these datasets to the neuromorphic domain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic vision sensing", "Neuromorphic vision", "Software", "Video analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data stream", "Dynamic vision", "Machine learning research", "Neuromorphic", "Neuromorphic visions", "Parameterized", "Pixel domain", "Video analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045313911", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"57201578715": {"Name": "Bi Y.", "AuthorID": "57201578715", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57207530477": {"Name": "Andreopoulos Y.", "AuthorID": "57207530477", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
