Despite a good understanding of the inflammatory cascade elicited following helminth infection, the initial source of IL-4 is unclear. Previous studies using the rat helminth parasite Nippostronglyus brasiliensis, identified an important role for basophil-derived IL-4 for TH2 differentiation. However, basophils are redundant for TH2 differentiation following infection with the natural helminth parasite of mice Heligmosomoides polygyrus, indicating that other sources of IL-4 are required. In this study using H. polygyrus, which is controlled by IL-4-dependent immunity, we identified that group-2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) produced significant amounts of IL-4 and IL-2 following H. polygyrus infection. Leukotriene D4 was sufficient to stimulate IL-4 secretion by ILC2s, and the supernatant from activated ILC2s could potently drive TH2 differentiation in vitro in an IL-4-dependent manner. Furthermore, specific deletion of IL-4 from ILC2s compromised TH2 differentiation in vivo. Overall, this study highlights a previously unrecognized and important role for ILC2-derived IL-4 for TH2 differentiation in a natural TH2-dependent model of human helminthiasis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cytokines", "Disease Models, Animal", "Host-Parasite Interactions", "Immunity, Innate", "Interleukin-4", "Lymph Nodes", "Lymphocyte Subsets", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nematospiroides dubius", "Strongylida Infections", "Th2 Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991608456", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55699429100": {"Name": "Pelly V.", "AuthorID": "55699429100", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "24802250900": {"Name": "Kannan Y.", "AuthorID": "24802250900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "36166242700": {"Name": "Coomes S.", "AuthorID": "36166242700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "56767961200": {"Name": "Entwistle L.", "AuthorID": "56767961200", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "35462946700": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "35462946700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "8283982700": {"Name": "R\u00fcckerl D.", "AuthorID": "8283982700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology and Infection Research (3IR), University of Edinburgh"}, "7006500719": {"Name": "Seddon B.", "AuthorID": "7006500719", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, UCL"}, "7401581916": {"Name": "Macdonald A.", "AuthorID": "7401581916", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7101774635": {"Name": "Mckenzie A.", "AuthorID": "7101774635", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of Cambridge"}}}
