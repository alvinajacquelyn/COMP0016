The QCL is mounted within a mechanically micro-machined waveguide cavity containing dual diagonal feedhorns. Operating in continuous-wave mode at 3.5 THz, and at an ambient temperature of ~60 K, QCL emission has been directed via the feedhorns to a supra-THz detector mounted on a multi-axis linear scanner. Comparison of simulated and measured far-field antenna patterns shows an excellent degree of correlation between beamwidth (full-width-half-maximum) and sidelobe content and a very substantial improvement when compared with unmounted devices. Additionally, a single output has been used to successfully illuminate and demonstrate an optical breadboard arrangement associated with a future supra-THz Earth observation space-borne payload. Our novel device has therefore provided a valuable demonstration of the effectiveness of supra-THz diagonal feedhorns and QCL devices for future space-borne ultra-high-frequency Earth-observing heterodyne radiometers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dual diagonal feedhorn", "Earth observation", "Heterodyne", "Quantum-cascade laser", "Radiometer", "Supra-terahertz"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna pattern measurement", "Degree of correlations", "dual diagonal feedhorn", "Earth observations", "Full width half maximum", "Tera Hertz", "Terahertz frequencies", "THz quantum cascade lasers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065482012", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7004091309": {"Name": "Ellison B.N.", "AuthorID": "7004091309", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space Department, STFC"}, "56964339500": {"Name": "Auriacombe O.", "AuthorID": "56964339500", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space Department, STFC"}, "24481356300": {"Name": "Gerber D.", "AuthorID": "24481356300", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space Department, STFC"}, "56963992000": {"Name": "Rawlings T.", "AuthorID": "56963992000", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space Department, STFC"}, "56230017600": {"Name": "Brewster N.", "AuthorID": "56230017600", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space Department, STFC"}, "7006070529": {"Name": "Oldfield M.L.", "AuthorID": "7006070529", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Space Department, STFC"}, "16687284500": {"Name": "Valavanis A.", "AuthorID": "16687284500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "24341106800": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "24341106800", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "8605376300": {"Name": "Li L.H.", "AuthorID": "8605376300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "57208669046": {"Name": "Zafar E.", "AuthorID": "57208669046", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "7005415578": {"Name": "Linfield E.H.", "AuthorID": "7005415578", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "56911604400": {"Name": "Davies A.G.", "AuthorID": "56911604400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "15844178300": {"Name": "Savini G.", "AuthorID": "15844178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7003506517": {"Name": "Emes M.", "AuthorID": "7003506517", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "9237088800": {"Name": "Winter B.", "AuthorID": "9237088800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "7404441122": {"Name": "Walker D.", "AuthorID": "7404441122", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Engineering, University of Huddersfield"}, "8553298600": {"Name": "Saenz E.", "AuthorID": "8553298600", "AffiliationID": "60031159", "AffiliationName": "Radio Frequency Payloads and Technology Division, European Space Agency"}}}
