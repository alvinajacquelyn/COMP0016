However, in this study, charged-particle track simulations are employed to quantify the induced physicochemical and potential biological implications when a primary ionising particle with energy 10 keV strikes a medium made up entirely of water or pyrimidine. Note that pyrimidine was chosen as the DNA/RNA bases cytosine, thymine, and uracil can be considered pyrimidine derivatives. This study aims to assess the influence of the choice of medium on the charged-particle transport, and identify how appropriate it is to use water as the default medium to describe the effects of ionising radiation on living tissue. Based on the respective electron interaction cross sections, we provide a model, which allows the study of radiation effects not only in terms of energy deposition (absorbed dose and stopping power) but also in terms of the number of induced molecular processes. Results of these parameters for water and pyrimidine are presented and compared.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological implications", "Charged particle transport", "Comparative studies", "Electron interaction", "Energy depositions", "Molecular constituents", "Molecular process", "Pyrimidine derivatives"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930406093", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"24329163500": {"Name": "Fuss M.", "AuthorID": "24329163500", "AffiliationID": "60004127, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de F\u00edsica Fundamental, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC)"}, "55263608200": {"Name": "Ellis-Gibbings L.", "AuthorID": "55263608200", "AffiliationID": "60004127, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de F\u00edsica Fundamental, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas (CSIC)"}, "7202755159": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda G.", "AuthorID": "7202755159", "AffiliationID": "60011664", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong"}, "57204316331": {"Name": "Jones D.", "AuthorID": "57204316331", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Physical Sciences, Flinders University"}, "7004997852": {"Name": "Brunger M.", "AuthorID": "7004997852", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematical Sciences, University of Malaya"}, "8398904700": {"Name": "Lim\u00e3o-Vieira P.", "AuthorID": "8398904700", "AffiliationID": "60022729", "AffiliationName": "Laborat\u00f3rio de Colis\u00f5es At\u00f3micas e Moleculares, CEFITEC, Universidade Nova de Lisboa"}, "24536776300": {"Name": "Blanco F.", "AuthorID": "24536776300", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60026796", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica At\u00f3mica, Molecular y Nuclear, Universidad Complutense de Madrid"}, "8725035900": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz A.", "AuthorID": "8725035900", "AffiliationID": "60005233", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaciones Energ\u00e9ticas Medioambientales y Tecnol\u00f3gicas"}}}
