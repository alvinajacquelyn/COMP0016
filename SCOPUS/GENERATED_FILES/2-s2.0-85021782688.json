Research priorities identified by people with a stoma are rarely elicited. Objectives: To improve the quality of life of people with a stoma through use of evidence-based practice based on research priorities set by patients. Design and Methods: Online pilot survey publicized in 2016 via United Kingdom stoma charities. People ranked nine stoma-related quality of life topics in order of research priority. Participants: People 16 years of age and over who currently have or have had a stoma for treatment for any medical condition. Analysis: Distributions of the priority scores for each of the nine research topics were examined. Group differences were explored using either the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test or the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test depending on the number of groups. Results: In total, 225 people completed the survey. The most important research priority was pouch leak problems and stoma bag/appliance problems followed by hernia risk. There were statistically significant differences in ranking research priorities between males and females, age, underlying disease that led to a stoma, stoma type and length of time with a stoma. Conclusion: People with a stoma are willing to engage in and set research priorities. The results should contribute towards future research about setting the research agenda for the study of stoma-related concerns that impact quality of life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colostomy", "ostomy", "public/patient involvement", "research priorities", "stoma", "urostomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Evidence-Based Practice", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Quality of Life", "Research", "Sex Factors", "Surgical Stomas", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021782688", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"15076862900": {"Name": "Hubbard G.", "AuthorID": "15076862900", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "University of Stirling"}, "6603117057": {"Name": "Gorely T.", "AuthorID": "6603117057", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "University of Stirling"}, "57192268622": {"Name": "Taylor C.", "AuthorID": "57192268622", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "London North West Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57194715131": {"Name": "Beeken B.", "AuthorID": "57194715131", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57198517077": {"Name": "Fisher A.", "AuthorID": "57198517077", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8642873500": {"Name": "Campbell A.", "AuthorID": "8642873500", "AffiliationID": "60018186", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Napier University"}, "8751834300": {"Name": "Gracey J.", "AuthorID": "8751834300", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "Ulster University"}, "24780619300": {"Name": "Grimmett C.", "AuthorID": "24780619300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "12788334200": {"Name": "Ozakinci G.", "AuthorID": "12788334200", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "University of St Andrews"}, "57194719631": {"Name": "Slater S.", "AuthorID": "57194719631", "AffiliationID": "60032803", "AffiliationName": "NHS Glasgow and Clyde"}}}
