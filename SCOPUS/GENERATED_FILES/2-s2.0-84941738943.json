We show that, in several areas \u2013 and particularly in relation to gender, ethnicity and age \u2013 union leaders do not represent well the diversity of the wider student body. In explaining these inequalities, we argue that friendship groups and other peer networks play a significant role in determining who does and does not take up leadership positions. Moreover, as friendship groups are often formed on the basis of \u2018differential association\u2019 and are thus frequently socially homogenous, inequalities tend to be perpetuated. Wider institutional cultures and societal norms are also implicated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diversity", "friendship groups", "higher education", "social networks", "students\u2019 unions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941738943", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"7402358771": {"Name": "Brooks R.", "AuthorID": "7402358771", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Surrey"}, "56216040200": {"Name": "Byford K.", "AuthorID": "56216040200", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Brunel University"}, "56214955700": {"Name": "Sela K.", "AuthorID": "56214955700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Widening Participation and Outreach Department, University of Surrey"}}}
