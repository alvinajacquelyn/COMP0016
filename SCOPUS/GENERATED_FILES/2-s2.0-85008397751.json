In the last few years, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has become the gold standard for non invasive diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis with the characteristic subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement. Case presentation: We describe a case of a patient who, in the process of aligning protocols for a trial between different centers, had a paired study with two different contrast agents, Dotarem\u00ae and MultiHance\u00ae. MultiHance\u00ae surprisingly failed to demonstrate the characteristic imaging pattern, showing only non specific late gadolinium enhancement at the inferior right ventricular insertion point and different myocardial extracellular volume fraction compared to the one obtained with Dotarem\u00ae. MultiHance\u00ae is used by many centres, because its partial blood protein binding is a strength for MR angiography, but late gadolinium enhancement, particularly non-ischemic, appears to be compromised. Conclusions: This case report suggests that contrast agents should be selected with caution, especially with new therapies lining up for amyloid and CMR being used as exploratory end point in clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloidosis", "Case report", "CMR", "Contrast"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyloidosis", "Cardiomyopathies", "Contrast Media", "Gadolinium", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008397751", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "55343433500": {"Name": "Martinez-Naharro A.", "AuthorID": "55343433500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free Hospital, National Amyloidosis Centre"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free Hospital, National Amyloidosis Centre"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free Hospital, National Amyloidosis Centre"}, "15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "West Smithfield, Barts Heart Centre"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "West Smithfield, Barts Heart Centre"}, "35620856500": {"Name": "Rosmini S.", "AuthorID": "35620856500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "West Smithfield, Barts Heart Centre"}, "7005246098": {"Name": "Kwong R.Y.", "AuthorID": "7005246098", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Harvard Medical School, Non-Invasive Cardiac Imaging, Cardiovascular Medicine Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}}
