However, there still exist problems with reproducing realistic values of density ratio and surface tension. In this study, a higher-order analysis of a general forcing term is derived. A forcing scheme is then constructed for the pseudopotential method that is able to accurately reproduce the full range of coexistence curves. As a result, multiphase flow of arbitrarily high density ratios independent of the surface tension can be simulated. Furthermore, the interface width can be tuned to allow for grid refinement and systematic error reduction. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme enables independent control of density ratio, surface tension, and interface width simultaneously.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coexistence curve", "Independent control", "Interface widths", "Lattice Boltzmann method", "Numerical results", "Pseudopotential method", "Pseudopotentials", "Systematic error reduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923197301", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"36994749100": {"Name": "Lycett-Brown D.", "AuthorID": "36994749100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
