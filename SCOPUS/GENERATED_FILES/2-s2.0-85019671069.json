This study presents the anonymized results of 13 international experts and resulting analyses from an expert elicitation workshop held in Shanghai in June 2014, the results from which have aided in the construction of the first elicited expertise-based fragility curves for the floor slabs and supporting columns of a generic, mid-rise, open-plan, cast-in-place reinforced concrete frame exposed to fire. The resulting fire intensity-to-structural response and structural response-to-damage relationship judgments from each expert are analyzed to form useful data to be used within a fragility assessment, following the philosophy of the PEER framework.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Expert elicitation", "Fragility assessment", "Fragility curves", "International experts", "Pacific earthquake engineering researches", "Reinforced concrete frames", "Structural response", "Supporting columns"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019671069", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57196982332": {"Name": "Ioannou I.", "AuthorID": "57196982332", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, University College London"}, "7801656850": {"Name": "Rossetto T.", "AuthorID": "7801656850", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "EPICentre, University College London"}, "6701795093": {"Name": "Aspinall W.", "AuthorID": "6701795093", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences and Cabot Institute, University of Bristol"}, "54958734100": {"Name": "Rush D.", "AuthorID": "54958734100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"}, "6507753420": {"Name": "Bisby L.", "AuthorID": "6507753420", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"}}}
