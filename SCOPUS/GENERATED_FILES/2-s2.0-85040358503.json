Creatinine kinetics have been advocated to estimate lean body mass (LBM) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and can be readily calculated in clinical practice from peritoneal dialysate effluent and urine collections. Bioimpedance is increasingly available, and we compared methods in 434 PD patients (55% men, 33.3% diabetics), mean age 55.2 \u00b1 16.2 years. LBM was lower by creatinine kinetics (47.8 \u00b1 16.6 kg men, 37.8 \u00b1 11.2 kg women) vs. bioimpedance (53.2 \u00b1 11.5 kg men, 39.2 \u00b1 7.2 kg women), p < 0.01. The prevalence of muscle wasting was much greater using creatinine kinetics (72.4% men, 52.4% women) vs. bioimpedance (55.2% men, 37.3%), p < 0.05. Estimates of LBM were much lower using creatinine kinetics compared to bioimpedance. Studies reporting the prevalence of muscle loss in PD patients will differ depending upon the method used to estimate muscle mass.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adult", "Aged", "Body Composition", "Body Fluid Compartments", "Creatinine", "Dialysis Solutions", "Electric Impedance", "Female", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscles", "Nutritional Status", "Peritoneal Dialysis", "Prevalence", "Sex Factors", "Wasting Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040358503", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57195753742": {"Name": "Yoowannakul S.", "AuthorID": "57195753742", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology Royal Free Hospital, University College London"}}}
