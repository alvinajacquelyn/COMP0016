We discuss the requirements for an Investigational New Drug application. The only available oral AT<inf>2</inf>R agonist with an extensive preclinical documentation, outlined in previous chapters, is used as the model for this discussion. The growing body of preclinical data in a wide range of areas relevant to clinical applications justifies human proof of concept clinical studies with compound 21 or other AT<inf>2</inf>R agonists in several indication areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AT<inf>2</inf> receptor agonist", "C21", "Clinical trial", "Food and Drug Administration", "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "Marfan syndrome", "Orphan drug", "Unmet medical needs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940030655", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"13004689900": {"Name": "Marina N.", "AuthorID": "13004689900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, University College London"}, "7005932031": {"Name": "Dahl\u00f6f B.", "AuthorID": "7005932031", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
