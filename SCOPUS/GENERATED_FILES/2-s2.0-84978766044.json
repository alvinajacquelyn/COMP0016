In this paper, we consider two applications that involve large-scale CMA, and demonstrate that fast multipole algorithms (FMAs) can be easily incorporated into the implicitly restarted Arnoldi method (IRAM) for eigenanalysis after simple modifications. The first application performs CMA for large platforms made by closed perfectly conducting surfaces. Multilevel FMA (MLFMA) is embedded into a combined field integral equation-based theory of characteristic mode (TCM). The second application addresses multiscale modeling of small but geometrically complicated objects, which possess fine subwavelength structures. An augmented electric field integral equation-based TCM is formulated, and low-frequency (LF-)FMA is adopted to accelerate the required matrix-vector products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Augmented electric field integral equation", "characteristic mode", "combined field integral equation", "fast multipole algorithm (FMA)", "large scale"], "IndexKeywords": ["Augmented electric field integral equations", "Characteristic modes", "Combined field integral equations", "Fast multipole algorithm", "large scale"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978766044", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55387694300": {"Name": "Dai Q.", "AuthorID": "55387694300", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana"}, "56702008900": {"Name": "Gan H.", "AuthorID": "56702008900", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana"}, "26643168800": {"Name": "Chew W.", "AuthorID": "26643168800", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana"}, "56093727200": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "56093727200", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronics and Information, Wuhan University"}, "55510854800": {"Name": "Liu Q.", "AuthorID": "55510854800", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
