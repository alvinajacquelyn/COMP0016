TDF may cause renal tubulopathy in a small proportion of recipients. We aimed to study the risk factors for developing severe renal tubulopathy. Methods We conducted an observational cohort study with retrospective identification of cases of treatment-limiting tubulopathy during TDF exposure. We used multivariate Poisson regression analysis to identify risk factors for tubulopathy, and mixed effects models to analyse adjusted estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slopes. Results Between October 2002 and June 2013, 60 (0.4%) of 15,983 patients who had received TDF developed tubulopathy after a median exposure of 44.1 (IQR 20.4, 64.4) months. Tubulopathy cases were predominantly male (92%), of white ethnicity (93%), and exposed to antiretroviral regimens that contained boosted protease inhibitors (PI, 90%). In multivariate analysis, age, ethnicity, CD4 cell count and use of didanosine or PI were significantly associated with tubulopathy. Tubulopathy cases experienced significantly greater eGFR decline while receiving TDF than the comparator group (\u22126.60 [\u22127.70, \u22125.50] vs. \u22120.34 [\u22120.43, \u22120.26] mL/min/1.73 m2/year, p < 0.0001). Conclusions Older age, white ethnicity, immunodeficiency and co-administration of ddI and PI were risk factors for tubulopathy in patients who received TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy. The presence of rapid eGFR decline identified TDF recipients at increased risk of tubulopathy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral", "Fanconi", "HIV", "Kidney", "Renal", "TDF", "Tenofovir", "Toxicity", "Tubulopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Kidney Diseases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Tenofovir"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011965308", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"24080447200": {"Name": "Hamzah L.", "AuthorID": "24080447200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "7005967261": {"Name": "Post F.A.", "AuthorID": "7005967261", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005100278": {"Name": "Hendry B.M.", "AuthorID": "7005100278", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "55872182100": {"Name": "Jose S.", "AuthorID": "55872182100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.A.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36150412800": {"Name": "Booth J.W.", "AuthorID": "36150412800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57221012087": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "57221012087", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36559400700": {"Name": "Hegazi A.", "AuthorID": "36559400700", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "St George's Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7103401198": {"Name": "Hay P.", "AuthorID": "7103401198", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "St George's Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "41862290500": {"Name": "Rayment M.", "AuthorID": "41862290500", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55722574900": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "55722574900", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55520378700": {"Name": "Bailey A.", "AuthorID": "55520378700", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "56754267000": {"Name": "Levy J.B.", "AuthorID": "56754267000", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "14025002900": {"Name": "Williams D.I.", "AuthorID": "14025002900", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals"}, "7201357349": {"Name": "Chadwick D.R.", "AuthorID": "7201357349", "AffiliationID": "60014315", "AffiliationName": "South Tees Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
