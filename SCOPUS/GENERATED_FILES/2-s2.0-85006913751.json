The first of these missions was the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), but that was followed by missions for studying exoplanets (e.g Terrestrial Planet Finder, Darwin), and then far-infrared interferometers (e.g.The Space Infrared Interferometric Telescope, the Far-Infrared Interferometer). Unfortunately, following the cancellation of SIM, the future for space-based interferometry has been in doubt, and the interferometric community needs to reevaluate the path forward. While interferometers have strong potential for scientific discovery, there are technological developments still needed, and continued maturation of techniques is important for advocacy to the broader astronomical community. We review the status of several concepts for space-based interferometry, and look for possible synergies between missions oriented towards different science goals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Infrared", "Interferometry", "Nulling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Astronomical community", "Far-infrared interferometers", "Nulling", "Scientific discovery", "Space infrared interferometric telescopes", "Space interferometry mission", "Technological development", "Terrestrial Planet Finders"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006913751", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7004577608": {"Name": "Rinehart S.", "AuthorID": "7004577608", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center"}, "6701453964": {"Name": "Leisawitz D.", "AuthorID": "6701453964", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center"}, "57192594615": {"Name": "Juanola-Paramon R.", "AuthorID": "57192594615", "AffiliationID": "107142432", "AffiliationName": "NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow"}, "15844178300": {"Name": "Savini G.", "AuthorID": "15844178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7103145591": {"Name": "Holland W.", "AuthorID": "7103145591", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}, "6602748263": {"Name": "Absil O.", "AuthorID": "6602748263", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e8 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "23008160800": {"Name": "Defr\u00e8re D.", "AuthorID": "23008160800", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "STAR Institute, Universit\u00e8 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "57202554545": {"Name": "Spencer L.", "AuthorID": "57202554545", "AffiliationID": "60024776", "AffiliationName": "University of Lethbridge"}, "36931135500": {"Name": "Rizzo M.", "AuthorID": "36931135500", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "University of Maryland"}, "7003488726": {"Name": "Mozurkewich D.", "AuthorID": "7003488726", "AffiliationID": "100393028", "AffiliationName": "Seabrook Engineering"}}}
