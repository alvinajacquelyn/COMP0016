In this letter, a joint vector perturbation precoding algorithm is proposed for multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) downlink system in the adaptive modulation scenario where different users apply different modulation types. Compared with conventional block diagonalized vector perturbation (BD-VP) and user grouping VP where the search dimension of the perturbation vector is reduced, the proposed algorithm keeps the search dimension unchanged by applying a simple transformation to the VP operation. Our analysis and results show that the proposed algorithm provides an applicable VP solution to the adaptive modulation scenario, with optimal VP performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adaptive modulation", "joint perturbation", "MIMO", "precoding", "vector perturbation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934289078", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56453725100": {"Name": "Li A.", "AuthorID": "56453725100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
