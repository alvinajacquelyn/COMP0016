Furthermore, to compare this new index with the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) and Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA). Patients and methods A training study, consisting of patients with benign ovarian disease (n = 809) and ovarian cancer (n = 246), was used to develop the Copenhagen Index (CPH-I) utilizing the variables serum HE4, serum CA125 and patient age. Eight international studies provided the validation population; comprising 1060 patients with benign ovarian masses and 550 patients with ovarian cancer. Results Overall, 2665 patients were included. CPH-I was highly significant in discriminating benign from malignant ovarian disease. At the defined cut-offof 0.070 for CPH-I the sensitivity and specificity were 95.0% and 78.4% respectively in the training cohort and 82.0% and 88.4% in the validation cohort. Comparison of CPH-I, ROMA and RMI demonstrated area-under-curve (AUC) at 0.960, 0.954 and 0.959 respectively in the training study and 0.951, 0.953 and 0.935 respectively in the validation study. Using a sensitivity of 95.0%, the specificities for CPH-I, ROMA and RMI in the training cohort were 78.4%, 71.7% and 81.5% respectively, and in the validation cohort 67.3%, 70.7% and 69.5% respectively. Conclusion All three indices perform well at the clinically relevant sensitivityof 95%, but CPH-I, unlike RMI and ROMA, is independent of ultrasound and menopausal status, and may provide a simple index to optimize referral of women with suspected ovarian cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age", "Biomarkers", "CA125", "Copenhagen Index", "CPH-I", "HE4", "Ovarian cancer", "Tumor markers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Algorithms", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "CA-125 Antigen", "Cohort Studies", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Multivariate Analysis", "Ovarian Diseases", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Prospective Studies", "Proteins", "Severity of Illness Index", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941425257", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"55332534700": {"Name": "Karlsen M.", "AuthorID": "55332534700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7003756888": {"Name": "H\u00f8gdall E.", "AuthorID": "7003756888", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60017814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Copenhagen, Herlev University Hospital"}, "7006485266": {"Name": "H\u00f8gdall C.", "AuthorID": "7006485266", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "7007084409": {"Name": "Christensen I.", "AuthorID": "7007084409", "AffiliationID": "60083854, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Biotech Research and Innovation Center (BRIC), University of Copenhagen"}, "6602177401": {"Name": "Borgfeldt C.", "AuthorID": "6602177401", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "55338234200": {"Name": "Kalapotharakos G.", "AuthorID": "55338234200", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "55559026500": {"Name": "Zdrazilova-Dubska L.", "AuthorID": "55559026500", "AffiliationID": "60001992", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute"}, "6602422155": {"Name": "Chovanec J.", "AuthorID": "6602422155", "AffiliationID": "60001992", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute"}, "7006410838": {"Name": "Lok C.", "AuthorID": "7006410838", "AffiliationID": "60070177", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Center for Gynecologic Oncology Amsterdam, Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "56676152900": {"Name": "Stiekema A.", "AuthorID": "56676152900", "AffiliationID": "60070177", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Center for Gynecologic Oncology Amsterdam, Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "54385764200": {"Name": "Mutz-Dehbalaie I.", "AuthorID": "54385764200", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Innsbruck Medical University"}, "7203080137": {"Name": "Rosenthal A.", "AuthorID": "7203080137", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56699330300": {"Name": "Moore E.", "AuthorID": "56699330300", "AffiliationID": "60120009", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, Li Ka Shing Centre"}, "56700187300": {"Name": "Schodin B.", "AuthorID": "56700187300", "AffiliationID": "60001681", "AffiliationName": "Abbott Diagnostics"}, "21735125400": {"Name": "Sumpaico W.", "AuthorID": "21735125400", "AffiliationID": "60110677", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, MCU-FDT Medical Foundation"}, "56107701200": {"Name": "Sundfeldt K.", "AuthorID": "56107701200", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg"}, "55043076400": {"Name": "Kristjansdottir B.", "AuthorID": "55043076400", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, University of Gothenburg"}, "25222115300": {"Name": "Zapardiel I.", "AuthorID": "25222115300", "AffiliationID": "60028162", "AffiliationName": "Gynecologic Oncology Unit, La Paz University Hospital"}}}
