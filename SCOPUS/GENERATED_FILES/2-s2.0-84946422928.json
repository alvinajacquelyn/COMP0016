Despite its importance, the spatial distribution of adversaries has often been neglected in mathematical models of conflict. In this paper, we propose an entropy-maximising spatial interaction method for disaggregating the impact of space, employing a general notion of 'threat' between two adversaries. This approach addresses a number of limitations that are associated with partial differential equation approaches to spatial disaggregation. We use this method to spatially disaggregate the Richardson model of conflict escalation, and then explore the resulting model with both analytical and numerical treatments. A bifurcation is identified that dramatically influences the resulting spatial distribution of conflict and is shown to persist under a range of model specifications. Implications of this finding for real-world conflicts are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conflict", "Differential Equations", "Spatial Modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conflict", "Dynamic spatial", "Model specifications", "Numerical treatments", "Richardson model", "Spatial disaggregation", "Spatial interaction", "Spatial modelling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946422928", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55210765400": {"Name": "Baudains P.", "AuthorID": "55210765400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55605786800": {"Name": "Davies T.P.", "AuthorID": "55605786800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7202504799": {"Name": "Bishop S.R.", "AuthorID": "7202504799", "AffiliationID": "60176024, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "55606560400": {"Name": "Fry H.M.", "AuthorID": "55606560400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}, "7404870460": {"Name": "Wilson A.G.", "AuthorID": "7404870460", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
