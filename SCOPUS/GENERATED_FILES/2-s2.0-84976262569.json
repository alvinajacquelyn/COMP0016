The high nonspecific binding of the first-generation TSPO radioligand [11C]PK-11195 limits accurate quantification. [18F]GE-180, a novel TSPO ligand, displays superior binding to [11C]PK-11195 in vitro. Our objectives were to: (1) evaluate tracer characteristics of [18F]GE-180 in the brains of healthy human subjects; and (2) investigate whether the TSPO Ala147Thr polymorphism influences outcome measures. Methods: Ten volunteers (five high-affinity binders, HABs, and five mixed-affinity binders, MABs) underwent a dynamic PET scan with arterial sampling after injection of [18F]GE-180. Kinetic modelling of time\u2013activity curves with one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models and Logan graphical analysis was applied to the data. The primary outcome measure was the total volume of distribution (VT) across various regions of interest (ROIs). Secondary outcome measures were the standardized uptake values (SUV), the distribution volume and SUV ratios estimated using a pseudoreference region. Results: The two-tissue compartment model was the best model. The average regional delivery rate constant (K1) was 0.01 mL cm\u22123 min\u22121 indicating low extraction across the blood\u2013brain barrier (1 %). The estimated median VT across all ROIs was also low, ranging from 0.16 mL cm\u22123 in the striatum to 0.38 mL cm\u22123 in the thalamus. There were no significant differences in VT between HABs and MABs across all ROIs. Conclusion: A reversible two-tissue compartment model fitted the data well and determined that the tracer has a low first-pass extraction (approximately 1 %) and low VT estimates in healthy individuals. There was no observable dependency on the rs6971 polymorphism as compared to other second-generation TSPO PET tracers. Investigation of [18F]GE-180 in populations with neuroinflammatory disease is needed to determine its suitability for quantitative assessment of TSPO expression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GE180", "Kinetic analysis", "Neuroinflammation", "Positron emission tomography (PET)", "Quantification", "Translocator protein (TSPO)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Algorithms", "Brain", "Carbazoles", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Kinetics", "Metabolic Clearance Rate", "Middle Aged", "Models, Neurological", "Molecular Imaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Receptors, GABA", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976262569", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56515047500": {"Name": "Feeney C.", "AuthorID": "56515047500", "AffiliationID": "60020416", "AffiliationName": "Computational, Cognitive and Clinical Neuroimaging Laboratory, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "36716886200": {"Name": "Scott G.", "AuthorID": "36716886200", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "54952540300": {"Name": "Raffel J.", "AuthorID": "54952540300", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "56621969300": {"Name": "Roberts S.", "AuthorID": "56621969300", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "22633329800": {"Name": "Coello C.", "AuthorID": "22633329800", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "57194123570": {"Name": "Jolly A.", "AuthorID": "57194123570", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "23010235000": {"Name": "Searle G.", "AuthorID": "23010235000", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "7101780173": {"Name": "Goldstone A.", "AuthorID": "7101780173", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "57202558741": {"Name": "Brooks D.", "AuthorID": "57202558741", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}, "15768161200": {"Name": "Nicholas R.", "AuthorID": "15768161200", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "7101894687": {"Name": "Gunn R.", "AuthorID": "7101894687", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "35559514400": {"Name": "Sharp D.", "AuthorID": "35559514400", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, Imperial College London"}, "6505810858": {"Name": "Trigg W.", "AuthorID": "6505810858", "AffiliationID": "60106637", "AffiliationName": "GE Healthcare Ltd"}}}
