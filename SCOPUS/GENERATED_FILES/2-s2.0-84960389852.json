The aims of this paper are to: (i) use a cross-sectional study design to compare characteristics of volunteers and recipients of a peer support programme for FCs of people with dementia, in terms of demographic background, social networks and psychological well-being; and (ii) use a longitudinal study design to explore the overall impact of the programme on the volunteers in terms of psychological well-being. Data were collected from programmes run in Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Berkshire and four London boroughs between October 2009 and March 2013. The volunteer role entailed empathic listening and encouragement over a 10-month period. Both carer support volunteers (N = 87) and recipient FCs (N = 109) provided baseline demographic information. Data on social networks, personal growth, self-efficacy, service use and well-being (SF-12; EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Control, Autonomy, Self-Realisation, Pleasure-19) were collected prior to the start of the intervention (N = 43) and at either 3- to 5 month or 10 month follow-up (N = 21). Volunteers were more likely than recipients of support to be female and to have cared for a parent/grandparent rather than spouse. Volunteers were also more psychologically well than support recipients in terms of personal growth, depression and perceived well-being. The longitudinal analysis identified small but significant declines in personal growth and autonomy and a positive correlation between the volunteers' duration of involvement and perceived well-being. These findings suggest that carers who volunteer for emotional support roles are resilient and are at little psychological risk from volunteering.", "AuthorKeywords": ["caregiver", "carer", "dementia", "peer support", "volunteer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Caregivers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dementia", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peer Group", "Qualitative Research", "Social Support", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Volunteers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960389852", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6602617245": {"Name": "Charlesworth G.", "AuthorID": "6602617245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57196608472": {"Name": "Sinclair J.B.", "AuthorID": "57196608472", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational, and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56033390000": {"Name": "Brooks A.", "AuthorID": "56033390000", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Department, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57162197100": {"Name": "Sullivan T.", "AuthorID": "57162197100", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Department, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57161789800": {"Name": "Ahmad S.", "AuthorID": "57161789800", "AffiliationID": "118066215", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Advisory Service, Age Concern Havering"}, "6507156058": {"Name": "Poland F.", "AuthorID": "6507156058", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Allied Health Professions, University of East Anglia"}}}
