On the basis of measurements of compressional sound velocities to \u223c100 GPa in diamond-anvil cells, extrapolated to inner-core pressures, it has been suggested that both the inner-core density and P-wave velocity can be matched simultaneously by the properties of a hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Fe\u2013Si or Fe\u2013Ni\u2013Si alloy. In this paper we present the results of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of hcp-Fe\u2013Si alloys at 360 GPa and at temperatures up to melting. We find that although the inner-core density can be readily matched by an Fe\u2013Si alloy, the same is not true for the wave velocities. At inner-core temperatures, the P-wave velocity in hcp-Fe\u2013Si remains equal to, or slightly above, that of hcp-Fe and shows little change with silicon content. The S-wave velocity is reduced with respect to that of pure hcp-iron, except for temperatures immediately prior to melting, where the velocities are almost equal; this is a consequence of the fact that the strong temperature dependence of the shear modulus that was seen in similar simulations of hcp-Fe just prior to melting was not found in hcp-Fe\u2013Si, and so in this temperature range the reduced S-wave velocity of pure iron closely matches that of the alloy. Our results show that for an hcp-Fe\u2013Si alloy matching the inner-core density, both the P-wave and the S-wave velocities will be higher than those observed by seismology and we conclude, therefore, that our calculations indicate that inner core velocities cannot be explained by an hcp-Fe\u2013Si alloy. The opposite conclusion, obtained previously from experimental data measured at lower pressures, is a consequence of: (i) the necessarily large extrapolation in pressure and temperature required to extend the experimental results to inner-core conditions and (ii) the use of a velocity\u2013density relationship for pure hcp-iron that is now considered to be incorrect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ab initio simulations", "Earth's inner core", "elastic properties", "iron\u2013silicon alloys", "molecular dynamics", "seismic wave velocities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation", "Ab initio simulations", "Earth's inner cores", "Elastic properties", "Hexagonal close packed", "Pressure and temperature", "Seismic wave velocity", "Temperature dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979221792", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"26531498000": {"Name": "Martorell B.", "AuthorID": "26531498000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7102583827": {"Name": "Wood I.", "AuthorID": "7102583827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7004463552": {"Name": "Brodholt J.", "AuthorID": "7004463552", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6603903752": {"Name": "Vo\u010dadlo L.", "AuthorID": "6603903752", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
