Drawing on desk research and interviews, it tests and validates the hypothesis that the key driving force for this development is the coupling of the financialisation of the Chinese economy and the politics of \u2018ecological civilisation\u2019, although learning through international interaction has also played a role. It further shows that the scope for the United Kingdom to benefit from this growth is limited by the structure of UK-China trade, China\u2019s strong macro-economic control and its approach to international relations that prioritises learning and identity transformation rather than the opening up of its markets. Inter-hub competition also plays a part.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chinese solutions", "domestic politics", "financialisation", "green bonds", "inter-hub competition", "learning", "liberalism versus statism", "macro-economic control", "market access", "national identity", "partnership", "UK-China relations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058556023", "SubjectAreas": [["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55578670200": {"Name": "Zhang L.Y.", "AuthorID": "55578670200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College London"}}}
