Our approach extends the generalized source method to nonlinear optical interactions by incorporating the contribution of nonlinear polarization sources to the diffracted field in the algorithm. We derive the mathematical formalism underlying the numerical method and introduce the Fourier-factorization suitable for nonlinear calculations. The numerical efficiency and runtime characteristics of the method are investigated in a set of benchmark calculations. The results corresponding to the fundamental frequency are compared to those obtained froma reference method and the beneficial effects of the modified Fourier-factorization rule on the accuracy of the nonlinear computations is demonstrated. To illustrate the capabilities of our method, we employ it to demonstrate strong enhancement of second-harmonic generationon one- and two-dimensional optical gratings resonantly coupled to a slab waveguide. Our method can be easily extended to other types of nonlinear optical interactions by simply incorporating the corresponding nonlinear polarization sources in the algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Benchmark calculations", "Fundamental frequencies", "Generalized source methods", "Mathematical formalism", "Nonlinear calculations", "Nonlinear computations", "Nonlinear optical interactions", "Nonlinear polarizations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926461821", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55671101600": {"Name": "Weismann M.", "AuthorID": "55671101600", "AffiliationID": "100397288", "AffiliationName": "Photon Design Ltd."}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55635229800": {"Name": "Gallagher D.", "AuthorID": "55635229800", "AffiliationID": "100397288", "AffiliationName": "Photon Design Ltd."}}}
