Rates of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Ukraine have declined to around 2-4%, but little is known about other pregnancy outcomes in this setting. We used data from an observational prospective cohort study to assess pregnancy outcomes among HIV-positive women in Ukraine. Methods The European Collaborative Study (ECS) in EuroCoord is a continuing cohort study, established in Ukraine in 2000. Eligible women are those with a diagnosis of HIV infection before or during pregnancy (including intrapartum) who deliver liveborn babies at seven sites. Maternal sociodemographic, HIV-related, and delivery (mother and infant) data were collected with study-specifi c questionnaires. We used Poisson regression models to identify factors associated with preterm delivery (before 37 weeks' gestation) and small weight for gestational age (less than the tenth percentile of weight for gestational age), based on complete cases. Findings Between January, 2000, and July, 2012, data were collected on 8884 HIV-positive mother and liveborn infant pairs. Median maternal age was 26\u00b75 years (IQR 23\u00b71-30\u00b73). 832 (11%) women had WHO stage 3 or 4 HIV and 1474 (17%) had a history of injecting drug use. 7348 (83%) had received antenatal ART. Among 7435 for whom ART type was available, 4396 (50%) had received zidovudine monotherapy and 2949 (33%) combination ART. Preterm delivery was seen in 780 (9%, 95% CI 8-9) of 8860 births overall and in 77 (9%, 7-11) of 889 babies with small size for gestational age. Factors associated with preterm delivery were history of injecting drug use (adjusted risk ratio 1\u00b764, 95% CI 1\u00b738-1\u00b795), no ART (2\u00b794, 2\u00b743-3\u00b757 vs zidovudine monotherapy), antenatal combination ART (1\u00b740, 1\u00b714-1\u00b773 vs zidovudine monotherapy), WHO stage 4 HIV (2\u00b742, 1\u00b771-3\u00b741 vs WHO stage 1), and being in the most socially deprived group (1\u00b738, 1\u00b711-1\u00b771). Small size for gestational age was associated with history of injecting drug use (adjusted RR 1\u00b739, 95% CI 1\u00b716-1\u00b765), most socially deprived (1\u00b732, 1\u00b709-1\u00b761), no ART (1\u00b760, 1\u00b732-1\u00b794 vs zidovudine monotherapy), and antenatal combination ART (1\u00b733, 1\u00b712-1\u00b760 vs zidovudine monotherapy). Interpretation Some risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes were directly associated with HIV and treatment and others were shared with the general antenatal population. Monitoring of pregnancy outcomes in Ukraine will be important as use of antenatal combination ART increases.
