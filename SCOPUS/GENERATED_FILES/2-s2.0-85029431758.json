This may be due to age-related dopamine (DA) decline affecting neural processing in striatum, prefrontal cortex, or both. We examined this by administering a probabilistic reward learning task to younger and older adults, and combining computational modelling of behaviour, fMRI and PET measurements of DA D1 availability. We found that anticipatory value signals in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) were attenuated in older adults. The strength of this signal predicted performance beyond age and was modulated by D1 availability in nucleus accumbens. These results uncover that a value-anticipation mechanism in vmPFC declines in aging, and that this mechanism is associated with DA D1 receptor availability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Choice Behavior", "Corpus Striatum", "Decision Making", "Dopamine", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neostriatum", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Probability Learning", "Receptors, Dopamine D1", "Reward", "Sweden", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029431758", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56397878100": {"Name": "De Boer L.", "AuthorID": "56397878100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute"}, "7102174121": {"Name": "B\u00e4ckman L.", "AuthorID": "7102174121", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute"}, "12781497100": {"Name": "Guitart-Masip M.", "AuthorID": "12781497100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "57208063706": {"Name": "Axelsson J.", "AuthorID": "57208063706", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Ume\u00e5 Center for Functional Brain Imaging, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "9939877500": {"Name": "Riklund K.", "AuthorID": "9939877500", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Ume\u00e5 Center for Functional Brain Imaging, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "56513444800": {"Name": "Nyberg L.", "AuthorID": "56513444800", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Medical Biology, Physiology, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
