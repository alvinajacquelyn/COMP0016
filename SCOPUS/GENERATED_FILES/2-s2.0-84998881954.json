A scaled model of the CHIPS detector filled with water from the Wentworth 2W pit, proposed site of the CHIPS deployment, in conjunction with a 3.2 m vertical column filled with this water, was used to study the transmission of 405 nm laser light. Results consistent with attenuation lengths of up to 100 m were observed for this wavelength with filtration and UV sterilization alone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Absorption", "Attenuation", "Cherenkov", "Detector", "Filtration", "Neutrino", "Water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attenuation", "Attenuation lengths", "Cherenkov", "Cherenkov light", "Neutrino", "UV-sterilization", "Vertical columns", "Water Cherenkov detectors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84998881954", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57192155664": {"Name": "Amat F.", "AuthorID": "57192155664", "AffiliationID": "60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix Marseille University Saint-Jerome"}, "57192155959": {"Name": "Bizouard P.", "AuthorID": "57192155959", "AffiliationID": "60102127", "AffiliationName": "Aix Marseille University Saint-Jerome"}, "56725056400": {"Name": "Bryant J.", "AuthorID": "56725056400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "22979302300": {"Name": "Germani S.", "AuthorID": "22979302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "56156546400": {"Name": "Perch A.J.", "AuthorID": "56156546400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "57196257540": {"Name": "Pf\u00fctzner M.M.", "AuthorID": "57196257540", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "57202725215": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "57202725215", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin"}, "57171887200": {"Name": "Whitehead L.H.", "AuthorID": "57171887200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}, "57192163061": {"Name": "Joyce T.", "AuthorID": "57192163061", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota"}, "7003643597": {"Name": "Marshak M.", "AuthorID": "7003643597", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota"}, "55711973400": {"Name": "Meier J.", "AuthorID": "55711973400", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota"}, "57212689400": {"Name": "Whitney M.", "AuthorID": "57212689400", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota"}, "57192154472": {"Name": "Kriesten B.", "AuthorID": "57192154472", "AffiliationID": "60016114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, College of William & Mary"}, "15923588200": {"Name": "Nelson J.K.", "AuthorID": "15923588200", "AffiliationID": "60016114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, College of William & Mary"}, "35228166300": {"Name": "Vahle P.", "AuthorID": "35228166300", "AffiliationID": "60016114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, College of William & Mary"}, "57203045500": {"Name": "Carroll T.J.", "AuthorID": "57203045500", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57192164067": {"Name": "Rijck S.D.", "AuthorID": "57192164067", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Texas at Austin"}, "34768860300": {"Name": "Salazar R.", "AuthorID": "34768860300", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57192161400": {"Name": "Trokan-Tenorio J.", "AuthorID": "57192161400", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin"}, "35838450200": {"Name": "Wendt C.", "AuthorID": "35838450200", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin"}, "57192154666": {"Name": "Wade R.", "AuthorID": "57192154666", "AffiliationID": "117777256", "AffiliationName": "Avenir Consulting"}}}
