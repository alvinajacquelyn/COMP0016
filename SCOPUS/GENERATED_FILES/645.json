In the venusian atmosphere, cosmic rays are expected to be the dominant ionization source below ~100. km altitude. While previous studies have considered the effect of cosmic ray ionization using approximate transport methods, we have for the first time performed full 3D Monte Carlo modeling of cosmic ray interaction with the venusian atmosphere, including the contribution of high-. Z cosmic ray ions (. Z=. 1-28). Our predictions are similar to those of previous studies at the ionization peak near 63. km altitude, but are significantly different to these both above and below this altitude. The rate of atmospheric ionization is a fundamental atmospheric property and the results of this study have wide-reaching applications in topics including atmospheric electrical processes, cloud microphysics and atmospheric chemistry.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aeronomy", "Ionospheres", "Venus", "Venus, atmosphere"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907996862", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"25638594500": {"Name": "Nordheim T.A.", "AuthorID": "25638594500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck, University College London"}, "7103145751": {"Name": "Coates A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103145751", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck, University College London"}, "55224172000": {"Name": "Jones G.H.", "AuthorID": "55224172000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60162133", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Planetary Sciences at UCL/Birkbeck, University College London"}, "16444267100": {"Name": "Dartnell L.R.", "AuthorID": "16444267100", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Space Research Centre, University of Leicester"}, "6602940179": {"Name": "Desorgher L.", "AuthorID": "6602940179", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Particle Physics, Paul Scherrer Institute"}}}
