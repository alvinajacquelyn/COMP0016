In this study, a multiscale quasicontinuum (QC) method was used to explore such an issue in a nano-scale copper (Cu) line protruding from a relatively large single crystal Cu substrate during compression. The results show that the yield stress of a rectangular beam on the substrate can be greatly reduced compared with that of a flat surface of the same area. For the rectangular line, the aspect ratio (width/height) affects dislocation morphology at the onset plasticity without much change of yield stress. However, for the trapezoidal line, the yield stress decreases with the base angle (\u03b1), especially when the \u03b1 is over 54.7\u00b0. As the sidewall orientation changes from 100 at \u03b1 = 0\u00b0, then to 111 at \u03b1 = 54.7\u00b0 and finally to 110 at \u03b1 = 90\u00b0, a higher surface energy could enable easier dislocation formation and lower yield stress. Meanwhile, it is found that the interaction between the line and the support substrate also shows a great effect on yield stress. Moreover, although it is possible to open two extra dislocation slip planes inside from the two bottom corners of the Cu line with the \u03b1 over 54.7\u00b0, dislocation nucleation derived from them is only observed at \u03b1 = 90\u00b0.", "AuthorKeywords": ["geometric effect", "multiscale quasicontinuum method", "nanoindentation", "onset plasticity", "patterned line"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dislocation formation", "Dislocation morphology", "Dislocation nucleation", "Geometric effects", "Orientation changes", "patterned line", "Quasi-continuum methods", "Resistance to deformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027237676", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56198051900": {"Name": "Jin J.", "AuthorID": "56198051900", "AffiliationID": "60118677, 60031863", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory for Anisotropy and Texture of Materials (Ministry of Education), Northeastern University"}, "57195330541": {"Name": "Cao J.", "AuthorID": "57195330541", "AffiliationID": "60118677, 60031863", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory for Anisotropy and Texture of Materials (Ministry of Education), Northeastern University"}, "57195330637": {"Name": "Zhou S.", "AuthorID": "57195330637", "AffiliationID": "60118677, 60031863", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory for Anisotropy and Texture of Materials (Ministry of Education), Northeastern University"}, "57195330413": {"Name": "Yang P.", "AuthorID": "57195330413", "AffiliationID": "60118677, 60031863", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Key Laboratory for Anisotropy and Texture of Materials (Ministry of Education), Northeastern University"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Materials Research and Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
