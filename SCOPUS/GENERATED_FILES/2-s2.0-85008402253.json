Through a detailed examination of its interiors, it provides an understanding of local perspectives on traditional households. Tracing the historical process of undressing and remaking this space, the article highlights the shifting local attitudes toward domesticity and different sentiments toward the house voiced by source communities and museum professionals. It aims to illuminate the contrasting time-spaces in which rural households are embedded and to provide a context for rethinking this material in the museum setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronotope", "Household", "Interior decoration", "Material culture", "Romania"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008402253", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"56505536900": {"Name": "Buchczyk M.", "AuthorID": "56505536900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Bristol"}}}
