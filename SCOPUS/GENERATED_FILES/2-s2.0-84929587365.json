LRBA) gene were recently described in patients with combined immunodeficiency, enteropathy and autoimmune cytopenia. Here, we extend the clinical and immunological phenotypic spectrum of LRBA associated disorders by reporting on three patients from two unrelated families who presented with splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy, cytopenia, elevated double negative T cells and raised serum Fas ligand levels resembling autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and one asymptomatic patient. Homozygous loss of function mutations in LRBA were identified by whole exome analysis. Similar to ALPS patients, Fas mediated apoptosis was impaired in LRBA deficient patients, while apoptosis in response to stimuli of the intrinsic mitochondria mediated apoptotic pathway was even enhanced. This manuscript illustrates the phenotypic overlap of other primary immunodeficiencies with ALPS-like disorders and strongly underlines the necessity of genetic diagnosis in order to provide early correct diagnosis and subsequent care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder", "Immunodeficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Apoptosis", "Apoptosis", "Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome", "Autoimmune Lymphoproliferative Syndrome", "Child", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Child, Preschool", "Humans", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant", "Male", "Male", "Mutation", "Mutation", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929587365", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"6603436524": {"Name": "Revel-Vilk S.", "AuthorID": "6603436524", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "6506302933": {"Name": "Stepensky P.", "AuthorID": "6506302933", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "22634120400": {"Name": "Fischer U.", "AuthorID": "22634120400", "AffiliationID": "60072305, 60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University"}, "56415058900": {"Name": "Nabhani S.", "AuthorID": "56415058900", "AffiliationID": "60072305, 60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University"}, "8624306900": {"Name": "Gombert M.", "AuthorID": "8624306900", "AffiliationID": "60072305, 60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University"}, "27267721100": {"Name": "H\u00f6nscheid A.", "AuthorID": "27267721100", "AffiliationID": "60072305, 60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University"}, "7004279679": {"Name": "Borkhardt A.", "AuthorID": "7004279679", "AffiliationID": "60072305, 60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich-Heine-University"}, "34067691200": {"Name": "Keller B.", "AuthorID": "34067691200", "AffiliationID": "60025641, 60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center and University of Freiburg"}, "36088833300": {"Name": "G\u00e1mez-D\u00edaz L.", "AuthorID": "36088833300", "AffiliationID": "60025641, 60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center and University of Freiburg"}, "6507946519": {"Name": "Rensing-Ehl A.", "AuthorID": "6507946519", "AffiliationID": "60025641, 60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center and University of Freiburg"}, "26643476400": {"Name": "Grimbacher B.", "AuthorID": "26643476400", "AffiliationID": "60025641, 60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center and University of Freiburg"}, "6701810147": {"Name": "Warnatz K.", "AuthorID": "6701810147", "AffiliationID": "60025641, 60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center and University of Freiburg"}, "57196915525": {"Name": "Saleh H.", "AuthorID": "57196915525", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Unit, Augusta Victoria Hospital"}, "6701787848": {"Name": "Shaag A.", "AuthorID": "6701787848", "AffiliationID": "60072445, 60007903", "AffiliationName": "Monique and Jacques Roboh Department of Genetic Research, Hadassah, Hebrew University Medical Center"}, "7007177914": {"Name": "Elpeleg O.", "AuthorID": "7007177914", "AffiliationID": "60072445, 60007903", "AffiliationName": "Monique and Jacques Roboh Department of Genetic Research, Hadassah, Hebrew University Medical Center"}}}
