Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground & Aims: Screening for oesophageal varices (OV) using conventional oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (C-OGD) is invasive and requires costly monitoring, recovery, and decontamination facilities. We aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility, acceptability and accuracy of a novel, portable and disposable office-based transnasal endoscope (EG Scan\u2122) compared to C-OGD as the reference standard. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. Consecutive adult patients with cirrhosis were invited to participate. All subjects underwent the two procedures on the same day performed by two endoscopists in a blinded design. Patients completed preference and validated tolerability (10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)) questionnaires on day 0 and day 14 post procedures. Results: Forty-five of 50 patients (90%) completed both interventions. Mean age was 59 years and OV prevalence was 49%. Patients reported higher preference (percentage) and better experience (mean VAS) with EG Scan compared to C-OGD on day 0 (76.5% vs. 23.5%, P < 0.001; 7.8 vs. 6.8, P = 0.058, respectively) and day 14 (77.8% vs. 22.2%, P < 0.001; 7.0 vs. 5.5, P = 0.0013 respectively). Sensitivity and specificity of the EG Scan for the diagnosis of any size OV were 0.82 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60\u20130.95), and 0.78 (95% CI 0.56\u20130.93) respectively. Corresponding values for the diagnosis of clinically significant (medium/large) OV were 0.92 (95% CI 0.62\u20131.0), 0.97 (95% CI 0.84\u20131.0) respectively. No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions: EG Scan accuracy was higher for the diagnosis of medium/large OV compared to any size OV. Patients' preference and overall experience of the EG Scan was favourable compared to C-OGD 14 days after procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["endoscopy", "screening", "transnasal", "varices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Disposable Equipment", "Endoscopy, Digestive System", "Esophageal and Gastric Varices", "Esophagoscopy", "Female", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Tertiary Care Centers", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971265411", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"55912766000": {"Name": "Sami S.S.", "AuthorID": "55912766000", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "6603107719": {"Name": "Ragunath K.", "AuthorID": "6603107719", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "57189469037": {"Name": "Wilkes E.A.", "AuthorID": "57189469037", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "25958622600": {"Name": "James M.", "AuthorID": "25958622600", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "57189457962": {"Name": "Mansilla-Vivar R.", "AuthorID": "57189457962", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "56076874600": {"Name": "Ortiz-Fern\u00e1ndez-Sordo J.", "AuthorID": "56076874600", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "57189456007": {"Name": "White J.", "AuthorID": "57189456007", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "57206320910": {"Name": "Khanna A.", "AuthorID": "57206320910", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "36646660200": {"Name": "Samuel S.", "AuthorID": "36646660200", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "6701559363": {"Name": "Aithal G.P.", "AuthorID": "6701559363", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "12242268700": {"Name": "Guha I.N.", "AuthorID": "12242268700", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Unit, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "36787498200": {"Name": "Coletta M.", "AuthorID": "36787498200", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60007067", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}}}
