They can be obtained by dynamical networks in which a preferential attachment process takes place. However, this mechanism is non-local, in the sense that it requires knowledge of the whole graph in order for the graph to be updated. Instead, if preferential attachment and realistic networks occur in physical systems, these features need to emerge from a local model. In this paper, we propose a local model and show that a possible ingredient (which is often underrated) for obtaining scale-free networks with local rules is memory. Such a model can be realised in solid-state circuits, using non-linear passive elements with memory such as memristors, and thus can be tested experimentally.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922362117", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36157854300": {"Name": "Caravelli F.", "AuthorID": "36157854300", "AffiliationID": "112681249", "AffiliationName": "London Institute of Mathematical Sciences"}, "8958614200": {"Name": "Hamma A.", "AuthorID": "8958614200", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Center for Quantum Information, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University"}, "7003831895": {"Name": "Di Ventra M.", "AuthorID": "7003831895", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of California-San Diego"}}}
