Human Brain Mapping Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Novel methods that stimulate neuroplasticity are increasingly being studied to treat neurological and psychiatric conditions. We sought to determine whether real-time fMRI neurofeedback training is feasible in Huntington's disease (HD), and assess any factors that contribute to its effectiveness. In this proof-of-concept study, we used this technique to train 10 patients with HD to volitionally regulate the activity of their supplementary motor area (SMA). We collected detailed behavioral and neuroimaging data before and after training to examine changes of brain function and structure, and cognitive and motor performance. We found that patients overall learned to increase activity of the target region during training with variable effects on cognitive and motor behavior. Improved cognitive and motor performance after training predicted increases in pre-SMA grey matter volume, fMRI activity in the left putamen, and increased SMA\u2013left putamen functional connectivity. Although we did not directly target the putamen and corticostriatal connectivity during neurofeedback training, our results suggest that training the SMA can lead to regulation of associated networks with beneficial effects in behavior. We conclude that neurofeedback training can induce plasticity in patients with Huntington's disease despite the presence of neurodegeneration, and the effects of training a single region may engage other regions and circuits implicated in disease pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain training", "Huntington's disease", "neurodegenerative diseases", "neurofeedback training", "neuroplasticity", "real-time fMRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Brain Mapping", "Cognition", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Motor Cortex", "Neurofeedback", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Organ Size", "Proof of Concept Study", "Putaminal Hemorrhage", "Volition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037997191", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56118589600": {"Name": "Papoutsi M.", "AuthorID": "56118589600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Huntington's Disease Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.J.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Huntington's Disease Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602786222": {"Name": "Weiskopf N.", "AuthorID": "6602786222", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57207864364": {"Name": "Langbehn D.", "AuthorID": "57207864364", "AffiliationID": "60009788, 60024324", "AffiliationName": "Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa"}, "6602616645": {"Name": "Reilmann R.", "AuthorID": "6602616645", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Section for Neurodegeneration and Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of Tuebingen"}}}
