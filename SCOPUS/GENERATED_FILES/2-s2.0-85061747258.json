Using this methodology, study participants repeatedly answer a set of questions, constructing a rich overview of the studied phenomena. One of the methodological decisions faced by researchers is deciding on the question scheduling. The literature defines three distinct schedule types: randomised, interval-based, or event-based (in our case, smartphone unlock). However, little evidence exists regarding the side-effects of these schedules on response rate and recall accuracy, and how they may bias study findings. We evaluate the effect of these three contingency configurations in a 3-week within-subjects study (N = 20). Participants answered various objective questions regarding their phone usage, while we simultaneously establish a ground-truth through smartphone instrumentation. We find that scheduling questions on phone unlock yields a higher response rate and accuracy. Our study provides empirical evidence for the effects of notification scheduling on participant responses, and informs researchers who conduct experience sampling studies on smartphones.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accuracy", "Contingency", "Data quality", "Ecological momentary assessment", "EMA", "ESM", "Experience sampling method", "Mobile questionnaires", "Response rate", "Self-report", "Smartphone", "Validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accuracy", "Contingency", "Data quality", "Ecological momentary assessment", "Experience sampling method", "Mobile questionnaires", "Response rate", "Self-report", "Validation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061747258", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human Factors and Ergonomics", "SOCI", "3307"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"]], "AuthorData": {"56032304300": {"Name": "van Berkel N.", "AuthorID": "56032304300", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Interaction Design Lab, The University of Melbourne"}, "7103326186": {"Name": "Goncalves J.", "AuthorID": "7103326186", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Interaction Design Lab, The University of Melbourne"}, "6508135447": {"Name": "Kostakos V.", "AuthorID": "6508135447", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Interaction Design Lab, The University of Melbourne"}, "57195415020": {"Name": "Lov\u00e9n L.", "AuthorID": "57195415020", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Center for Ubiquitous Computing, University of Oulu"}, "39961368900": {"Name": "Ferreira D.", "AuthorID": "39961368900", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Center for Ubiquitous Computing, University of Oulu"}, "15044553200": {"Name": "Hosio S.", "AuthorID": "15044553200", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Center for Ubiquitous Computing, University of Oulu"}}}
