It is important to understand if the use of these workstations has an impact on worker productivity. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effect of active workstations on workplace productivity and performance. A total of 3303 articles were initially identified by a systematic search and seven articles met eligibility criteria for inclusion. A quality appraisal was conducted to assess risk of bias, confounding, internal and external validity, and reporting. Most of the studies reported cognitive performance as opposed to productivity. Five studies assessed cognitive performance during use of an active workstation, usually in a single session. Sit-stand desks had no detrimental effect on performance, however, some studies with treadmill and cycling workstations identified potential decreases in performance. Many of the studies lacked the power required to achieve statistical significance. Three studies assessed workplace productivity after prolonged use of an active workstation for between 12 and 52 weeks. These studies reported no significant effect on productivity. Active workstations do not appear to decrease workplace performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active workstation", "Performance", "Physical activity", "Productivity", "Sedentary behavior", "Sit-stand", "Treadmill desk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Efficiency", "Employee Performance Appraisal", "Humans", "Interior Design and Furnishings", "Movement", "Posture", "Sedentary Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042781806", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57200987461": {"Name": "Ojo S.", "AuthorID": "57200987461", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Health Research, University of Bedfordshire"}, "7003309148": {"Name": "Hewson D.", "AuthorID": "7003309148", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Health Research, University of Bedfordshire"}, "56277724200": {"Name": "Bailey D.", "AuthorID": "56277724200", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sport and Physical Activity Research, School of Sport Science and Physical Activity, University of Bedfordshire"}, "54408176900": {"Name": "Chater A.", "AuthorID": "54408176900", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sport and Physical Activity Research, School of Sport Science and Physical Activity, University of Bedfordshire"}}}
