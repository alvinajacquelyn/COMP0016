All rights reserved.Objective We estimated associations of time of day with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors measured in older men. Methods CVD risk factors (markers of inflammation and haemostasis, and cardiac markers) were measured on one occasion between 08:00 and 19:00 hours in 4252 men aged 60-79 years from the British Regional Heart Study. Linear models were used to estimate associations between time of day and risk factors. When an association was found, we examined whether the relationship between risk factors and cardiovascular mortality was affected by the adjustment for time of day using survival analyses. Results N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels increased by 3.3% per hour (95% CI 1.9% to 4.8%), interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased by 2.6% per hour (95% CI 1.8% to 3.4%), while tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) decreased by 3.3% per hour (95% CI 3.7% to 2.9%); these associations were unaffected by adjustment for possible confounding factors. The percentages of variation in these risk factors attributable to time of day were less than 2%. In survival analyses, the association of IL-6, NT-proBNP and t-PA with cardiovascular mortality was not affected by the adjustment for time of day. C reactive protein, fibrinogen, D-dimer, von Willebrand factor and cardiac troponin T showed no associations with time of day. Conclusions In older men, markers of inflammation (IL-6), haemostasis (t-PA) and a cardiac marker (NT-proBNP) varied by time of day. The contribution of time of day to variations in these markers was small and did not appear to be relevant for the CVD risk prediction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biological Markers", "Cardiovascular Disease", "Diurnal Variations", "Older Adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biomarkers", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Natriuretic Peptide, Brain", "Peptide Fragments", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis", "Time Factors", "Tissue Plasminogen Activator", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049713866", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55811454000": {"Name": "Sartini C.", "AuthorID": "55811454000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.J.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "56678958000": {"Name": "Lowe G.D.O.", "AuthorID": "56678958000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"}, "35308260700": {"Name": "Welsh P.", "AuthorID": "35308260700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"}, "7007043802": {"Name": "Sattar N.", "AuthorID": "7007043802", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow, Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences"}, "57203678577": {"Name": "Morris R.W.", "AuthorID": "57203678577", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, Schoolof Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
