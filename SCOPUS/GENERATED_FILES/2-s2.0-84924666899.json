Many hydrogen-evolving photocatalysts are active in the ultraviolet range, but ultraviolet light accounts for only 3% of the energy available in the solar spectrum at ground level. Solid-state crystalline photocatalysts have light absorption profiles that are a discrete function of their crystalline phase and that are not always tunable. Here, we prepare a series of amorphous, microporous organic polymers with exquisite synthetic control over the optical gap in the range 1.94-2.95 eV. Specific monomer compositions give polymers that are robust and effective photocatalysts for the evolution of hydrogen from water in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, without the apparent need for an added metal cocatalyst. Remarkably, unlike other organic systems, the best performing polymer is only photoactive under visible rather than ultraviolet irradiation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Evolution of hydrogens", "Hydrogen evolution", "Microporous organic polymers", "Monomer compositions", "Photocatalytic hydrogen production", "Sacrificial electron donors", "Ultraviolet irradiations", "Visible-light-driven"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924666899", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"36657600800": {"Name": "Sprick R.", "AuthorID": "36657600800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "8720613000": {"Name": "Jiang J.", "AuthorID": "8720613000", "AffiliationID": "60000174", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Shaanxi Normal University"}, "23099464700": {"Name": "Bonillo B.", "AuthorID": "23099464700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "57199765186": {"Name": "Ren S.", "AuthorID": "57199765186", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Polymer Science and Engineering, Sichuan University"}, "55470482700": {"Name": "Ratvijitvech T.", "AuthorID": "55470482700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "55015893700": {"Name": "Adams D.", "AuthorID": "55015893700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "7401832651": {"Name": "Cooper A.", "AuthorID": "7401832651", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Materials Discovery, University of Liverpool"}, "55805566600": {"Name": "Guiglion P.", "AuthorID": "55805566600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
