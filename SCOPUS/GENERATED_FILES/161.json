Some studies have suggested that parents are especially sensitive to risks to their children. We compared 245 parents' willingness to vaccinate their child versus themselves in nine hypothetical scenarios relating to influenza strains. Scenarios varied according to non-vaccination risk (low, medium and high) and 'risk target' (oneself, one's child or, as a comparator, one's elderly parent). Participants were more willing to vaccinate their child (61% acceptance) than themselves (54%) or their parent (56%). Parents may be more risk-sensitive when deciding for their child than for themselves.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "health behaviour", "health psychology", "quantitative methods", "risk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude to Health", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Choice Behavior", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Influenza, Human", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parent-Child Relations", "Vaccination", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966546053", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"57189244866": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "57189244866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Health Behaviour Research Centre"}, "15123109500": {"Name": "Shahab L.", "AuthorID": "15123109500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Health Behaviour Research Centre"}, "35723547800": {"Name": "Gardner B.", "AuthorID": "35723547800", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "35619646000": {"Name": "Robb K.", "AuthorID": "35619646000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow"}}}
