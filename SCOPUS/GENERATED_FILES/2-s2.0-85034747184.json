Narratives comprising attachment-dependent content were proposed to modulate activation of cognitive-emotional schemata in listeners. We studied the effects after listening to prototypical attachment narratives on wellbeing and countertransference-reactions in 149 healthy participants. Neural correlates of these cognitive-emotional schema activations were investigated in a 7 Tesla rest-task-rest fMRI-study (23 healthy males) using functional connectivity (FC) analysis of the social approach network (seed regions: left and right Caudate Nucleus, CN). Reduced FC between left CN and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) represented a general effect of prior auditory stimulation. After presentation of the insecure-dismissing narrative, FC between left CN and bilateral temporo-parietal junction, and right dorsal posterior Cingulum was reduced, compared to baseline. Post-narrative FC-patterns of insecure-dismissing and insecure-preoccupied narratives differed in strength between left CN and right DLPFC. Neural correlates of the moderating effect of individual attachment anxiety were represented in a reduced CN-DLPFC FC as a function of individual neediness-levels. These findings suggest specific neural processing of prolonged mood-changes and schema activation induced by attachment-specific speech patterns. Individual desire for interpersonal proximity was predicted by attachment anxiety and furthermore modulated FC of the social approach network in those exposed to such narratives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attachment", "brain connectivity", "brain networks", "fMRI", "human social interaction", "resting state"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Emotions", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Narration", "Neural Pathways", "Object Attachment", "Social Perception", "Speech Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034747184", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56345735400": {"Name": "Krause A.L.", "AuthorID": "56345735400", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Otto von Guericke University"}, "55027681600": {"Name": "Colic L.", "AuthorID": "55027681600", "AffiliationID": "60020075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Neurology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology"}, "56346100200": {"Name": "Borchardt V.", "AuthorID": "56346100200", "AffiliationID": "60020075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Neurology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology"}, "57157764900": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57157764900", "AffiliationID": "60020075", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioral Neurology, Leibniz Institute for Neurobiology"}, "35300798800": {"Name": "Walter M.", "AuthorID": "35300798800", "AffiliationID": "113133429", "AffiliationName": "Center for Behavioral Brain Sciences (CBBS)"}, "55455767700": {"Name": "Strauss B.", "AuthorID": "55455767700", "AffiliationID": "60023251", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Jena, Institute of Psychosocial Medicine and Psychotherapy"}, "6603617382": {"Name": "Buchheim A.", "AuthorID": "6603617382", "AffiliationID": "60009999", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Innsbruck"}, "55901629300": {"Name": "Wildgruber D.", "AuthorID": "55901629300", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Eberhard-Karls University"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "36017210900": {"Name": "Nolte T.", "AuthorID": "36017210900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
