This enables us to generate inter-regional migration flows within Europe. The chapter proposes a methodology for estimating the inter-regional flows which pose particular local policy problems within Europe. A new multi-level spatial interaction model (MLSIM) is proposed which incorporates data at both country and regional levels in Europe to produce estimates of the inter-regional, inter-country flows consistent with known information at these different levels. The chapter concentrates on 2006, but data for other years exist, and so a natural extension to this work would be to explore the temporal dynamics of particular sets of inter-regional flows in the system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biproportional fitting", "Entropy-maximising methods", "Europe", "Inter-regional migration", "Model parameter calibration", "Multi-level spatial interaction model", "Spatial system"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017412444", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"26030392400": {"Name": "Dennett A.", "AuthorID": "26030392400", "AffiliationID": "60179133", "AffiliationName": "Royal Geographical Society"}, "7404870460": {"Name": "Wilson A.", "AuthorID": "7404870460", "AffiliationID": "118346000", "AffiliationName": "Home Office Science Advisory Council"}}}
