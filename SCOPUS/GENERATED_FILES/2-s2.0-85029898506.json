No formal validity arguments exist for the ICCE, but it claims to prepare students for university entrance. This article assesses the validity of the ICCE by comparing the stated objectives in ACE workbooks with the activities on its tests. It is argued that many of the learning objectives are never tested at all. Those that are tested are frequently covered only superficially. The tests rely extensively on rote memorisation which fails to prove understanding of concepts, and ACE\u2019s definitions of academic disciplines are often rather different from, and inferior to, the understandings of mainstream academia. It is concluded that, while students from alternative educational backgrounds should not be penalised, ICCE results cannot provide the robust evidence of academic achievement that universities are entitled to expect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerated Christian Education", "assessment", "Christian education", "curriculum", "validity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029898506", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57195835954": {"Name": "Scaramanga J.", "AuthorID": "57195835954", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "7202205455": {"Name": "Reiss M.J.", "AuthorID": "7202205455", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
