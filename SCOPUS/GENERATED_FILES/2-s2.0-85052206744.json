Aims To investigate which factors predict disengagement with EIP services. Method Using data from a naturalistic cohort of 786 EIP clients in East Anglia (UK), we investigated the association between sociodemographic and clinical predictors and disengagement using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results Over half (54.3%) of our sample were discharged before receiving 3 years of EIP care, with 92 (11.7%) participants discharged due to disengagement. Milder negative symptoms, more severe hallucinations, not receiving an FEP diagnosis, polysubstance use and being employed were associated with greater disengagement. Conclusions Our findings highlight heterogeneous reasons for disengagement with EIP services. For some patients, early disengagement may hinder efforts to sustain positive long-term EIP outcomes. Efforts to identify true FEP cases and target patients with substance use problems and more severe positive symptoms may increase engagement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cohort study", "Early intervention services", "Psychosis", "SEPEA", "Social Epidemiology of Psychosis in East Anglia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cohort Studies", "Early Diagnosis", "Early Medical Intervention", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Patient Compliance", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenic Psychology", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052206744", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57212959813": {"Name": "Mohammadi A.", "AuthorID": "57212959813", "AffiliationID": "60001306", "AffiliationName": "St. Ann's Hospital"}, "35976805300": {"Name": "Perez J.A.", "AuthorID": "35976805300", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust, National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care East of England"}, "26021246400": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "26021246400", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Foundation Trust, National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care East of England"}, "33067781700": {"Name": "Hameed Y.", "AuthorID": "33067781700", "AffiliationID": "60171632", "AffiliationName": "Norfolk and Suffolk Foundation Trust"}, "57218240440": {"Name": "Kirkbride J.B.", "AuthorID": "57218240440", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology, Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "55263597100": {"Name": "Solmi F.", "AuthorID": "55263597100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "PsyLife Group, Division of Psychiatry, University College London, Wing B, Maple House"}}}
