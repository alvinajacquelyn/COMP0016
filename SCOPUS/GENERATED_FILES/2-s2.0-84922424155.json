We attempted to understand this relationship and create a mathematical model to relate these two methods of determining mycobacterial load. Methods: Sequential bacteriological load data from clinical trials determined by MGIT and cfu were collected and mathematical models derived. All model fittings were conducted in the R statistical software environment (version 3.0.2), using the lm and nls functions. Results: TTP showed a negative correlation with log10 cfu on all 14 days of the study. There was an increasing gradient of the regression line and y-intercept as treatment progressed. There was also a trend towards an increasing gradient with higher doses of rifampicin. Conclusions: These data suggest that there is a population of mycobacterial cells that are more numerous when detected in liquid than on solid medium. Increasing doses of rifampicin differentially kill this group of organisms. These findings support the idea that increased doses of rifampicin are more effective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["M. tuberculosis", "TB", "TTP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Antitubercular Agents", "Bacterial Load", "Datasets as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Models, Statistical", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Phenotype", "Sputum", "Tuberculosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922424155", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55967920700": {"Name": "Bowness R.", "AuthorID": "55967920700", "AffiliationID": "60022132, 60009979", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of St Andrews"}, "7101706332": {"Name": "Gillespie S.H.", "AuthorID": "7101706332", "AffiliationID": "60022132, 60009979", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of St Andrews"}, "6701324148": {"Name": "Boeree M.J.", "AuthorID": "6701324148", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center, Department of Pulmonary Diseases"}, "6506988890": {"Name": "Plemper van balen G.", "AuthorID": "6506988890", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center, Department of Pulmonary Diseases"}, "6603807383": {"Name": "Aarnoutse R.", "AuthorID": "6603807383", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center, Department of Clinical Pharmacy"}, "24471532800": {"Name": "Dawson R.", "AuthorID": "24471532800", "AffiliationID": "60079962", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonology, Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town Lung Institute"}, "7004254865": {"Name": "Diacon A.", "AuthorID": "7004254865", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University"}, "55775435600": {"Name": "Mangu C.", "AuthorID": "55775435600", "AffiliationID": "113364008", "AffiliationName": "NIMR-Mbeya Medical Research Centre"}, "55382485700": {"Name": "Ntinginya N.E.", "AuthorID": "55382485700", "AffiliationID": "113364008", "AffiliationName": "NIMR-Mbeya Medical Research Centre"}, "57208245661": {"Name": "Kohlenberg A.", "AuthorID": "57208245661", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department for Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, University of Munich"}, "41762113200": {"Name": "Mtafya B.", "AuthorID": "41762113200", "AffiliationID": "113364008", "AffiliationName": "NIMR-Mbeya Medical Research Centre"}, "27867640800": {"Name": "Heinrich N.", "AuthorID": "27867640800", "AffiliationID": "118011497", "AffiliationName": "DZIF German Centre for Infection Research"}, "6508250293": {"Name": "Rachow A.", "AuthorID": "6508250293", "AffiliationID": "118011497", "AffiliationName": "DZIF German Centre for Infection Research"}, "18234077800": {"Name": "Phillips P.P.J.", "AuthorID": "18234077800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council (MRC), Clinical Trials Unit, at UCL"}}}
