Of high clinical importance, the pathway incorporates rate limiting enzymatic reactions with multiple negative feedbacks. In this work we investigate the pathway dynamics and demonstrate that rate limiting steps and negative feedbacks within it act in concert to tightly regulate intracellular cholesterol levels. Formulated using the theory of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and parameterised in the context of a hepatocyte, the governing equations are analysed numerically and analytically. Sensitivity and mathematical analysis demonstrate the importance of the two rate limiting enzymes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and squalene synthase in controlling the concentration of substrates within the pathway as well as that of cholesterol. The role of individual feedbacks, both global (between that of cholesterol and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2; SREBP-2) and local internal (between substrates in the pathway) are investigated. We find that whilst the cholesterol SREBP-2 feedback regulates the overall system dynamics, local feedbacks activate within the pathway to tightly regulate the overall cellular cholesterol concentration. The network stability is analysed by constructing a reduced model of the full pathway and is shown to exhibit one real, stable steady-state. We close by addressing the biological question as to how farnesyl-PP levels are affected by CYP51 inhibition, and demonstrate that the regulatory mechanisms within the network work in unison to ensure they remain bounded.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Feedback", "HMGCR", "Nonlinear ordinary differential equation", "Squalene synthase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cholesterol", "Cytochrome P450 Family 51", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Lipogenesis", "Mevalonic Acid", "Models, Biological", "Polyisoprenyl Phosphates", "Sesquiterpenes", "Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041898382", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57197867315": {"Name": "Pool F.", "AuthorID": "57197867315", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7103088722": {"Name": "Currie R.", "AuthorID": "7103088722", "AffiliationID": "60012970", "AffiliationName": "Syngenta, Jealott's Hill International Research Centre"}, "6602267577": {"Name": "Sweby P.", "AuthorID": "6602267577", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Reading"}, "16314290300": {"Name": "Tindall M.", "AuthorID": "16314290300", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Research, University of Reading"}, "23670678800": {"Name": "Salazar J.", "AuthorID": "23670678800", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": null}}}
