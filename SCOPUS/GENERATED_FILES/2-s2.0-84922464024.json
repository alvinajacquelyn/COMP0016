All rights reserved.Introduction Coagulopathy associates with poor outcome in sepsis. Mild induced hypothermia has been proposed as treatment in sepsis but it is not known whether this intervention worsens functional coagulopathy. Materials and methods Interim analysis data from an ongoing randomized controlled trial; The Cooling And Surviving Septic shock (CASS) study. Patients suffering severe sepsis/septic shock are allocated to either mild induced hypothermia (cooling to 32-34 \u00b0C for 24 hours) or control (uncontrolled temperature). Trial registration: NCT01455116. Thrombelastography (TEG) is performed three times during the first day after study enrollment in all patients. Reaction time (R), maximum amplitude (MA) and patients' characteristics are here reported. Results One hundred patients (control n = 50 and intervention n = 50; male n = 59; median age 68 years) with complete TEG during follow-up were included. At enrollment, 3%, 38%, and 59% had a hypocoagulable, normocoagulable, and hypercoagulable TEG clot strength (MA), respectively. In the hypothermia group, functional coagulopathy improved during the hypothermia phase, measured by R and MA, in patients with hypercoagulation as well as in patients with hypocoagulation (correlation between \u0394R and initial R: rho = -0.60, p < 0.0001 and correlation between \u0394MA and initial MA: rho = -0.50, p = 0.0002). Similar results were not observed in the control group neither for R (rho = -0.03, p = 0.8247) nor MA (rho = -0.15, p = 0.3115). Conclusion Mild induced hypothermia did seem to improve functional coagulopathy in septic patients. This improvement of functional coagulopathy parameters during the hypothermia intervention persisted after rewarming. Randomized trials are warranted to determine whether the positive effect on sepsis-related coagulopathy can be transformed to improved survival.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coagulopathy", "Mild induced hypothermia", "Randomized controlled trial", "Sepsis", "Thrombelastography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Coagulation", "Blood Coagulation Disorders", "Elasticity", "Female", "Humans", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sepsis", "Shock, Septic", "Temperature", "Thrombelastography", "Thrombophilia", "Treatment Outcome", "Viscosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922464024", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"55168171500": {"Name": "Johansen M.E.", "AuthorID": "55168171500", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Reumathology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "14622583000": {"Name": "Jensen J.U.", "AuthorID": "14622583000", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Reumathology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "14825469800": {"Name": "Kj\u00e6r J.", "AuthorID": "14825469800", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Reumathology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free and University College Medical School London"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases and Reumathology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}, "6602955356": {"Name": "Bestle M.H.", "AuthorID": "6602955356", "AffiliationID": "60022645", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Nordsjaellands Hospital"}, "7006413776": {"Name": "Ostrowski S.R.", "AuthorID": "7006413776", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Section for Transfusion Medicine, Capital Region Blood Bank, Rigshospitalet"}, "8683869300": {"Name": "Johansson P.I.", "AuthorID": "8683869300", "AffiliationID": "60021568", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of Texas Medical School"}, "24492377500": {"Name": "Thormar K.", "AuthorID": "24492377500", "AffiliationID": "60025840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Bispebjerg Hospital"}, "56508946800": {"Name": "Christensen H.", "AuthorID": "56508946800", "AffiliationID": "60017814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Herlev"}, "8094934500": {"Name": "Pedersen H.P.", "AuthorID": "8094934500", "AffiliationID": "112722852", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Roskilde"}, "55307476000": {"Name": "Poulsen L.", "AuthorID": "55307476000", "AffiliationID": "114976052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital K\u00f8ge"}, "39762368600": {"Name": "Mohr T.", "AuthorID": "39762368600", "AffiliationID": "60014959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, University Hospital Gentofte"}, "35448468800": {"Name": "M\u00f8ller K.", "AuthorID": "35448468800", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Neurointensive Care Unit 2093, Department of Neuroanaesthesiology, University Hospital Rigshospitalet"}, "7005070493": {"Name": "T\u00f8nnesen E.", "AuthorID": "7005070493", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital"}}}
