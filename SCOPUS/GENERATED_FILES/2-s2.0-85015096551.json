Methods: A radiofrequency coil was designed for optimized signal homogeneity and sensitivity in the finger at ultrahigh magnetic field strength (7 T), providing high measurement sensitivity. Imaging sequences (2D turbo-spin echo (TSE) and 3D magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE)) were adapted for high spatial resolution and good contrast of different tissues in the finger, while keeping acquisition time below 10 minutes. Data was postprocessed to display finger structures in three dimensions. Results: 3D MPRAGE data with isotropic resolution of 200 \u00b5m, along with 2D TSE images with in-plane resolutions of 58 \u00d7 78 \u00b5m2 and 100 \u00d7 97 \u00b5m2, allowed clear identification of various anatomical features such as bone and bone marrow, tendons and annular ligaments, cartilage, arteries and veins, nerves, and Pacinian corpuscles. Conclusion: Using this dedicated finger coil at 7 T, together with adapted acquisition sequences, it is possible to depict the internal structures of the human finger in vivo within patient-compatible measurement time. It may serve as a tool for diagnosis and treatment monitoring in pathologies ranging from inflammatory or erosive joint diseases to injuries of tendons and ligaments to nervous or vascular disorders in the finger.
