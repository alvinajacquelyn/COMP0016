We aimed to evaluate if patients carrying X4 or R5 strains have a different liver fibrosis (LF) progression over time. Methods A total of 1,137 HIV-infected patients in ICONA cohort (21% females, 7% HCV co-infected) with an available determination of HIV-1 co-receptor tropism (CRT), a Fibrosis-4 Index for Liver Fibrosis (FIB-4) <3.25 and at least one-year follow-up were included. CRT was assessed by gp120 sequencing on plasma RNA and geno2pheno algorithm (10% false positive rate) or by Trofile. LF was assessed by means of FIB-4. LF progression was defined as an absolute score increase or a transition to higher fibrosis stratum and/or occurrence of liver-related clinical events. Results A total of 249 (22%) patients carried X4 strains, which were associated with older age, lower CD4 count, lower nadir CD4, and intravenous drug use. Overall, X4 and R5 patients had similar baseline FIB-4 scores and similar mean FIB-4 slope after a median follow-up of 35 months. There was no difference between X4 and R5 for time to LF progression (p = 0.925). Estimated risk of LF at 24 months (95% CI) after baseline in X4 and R5 was 10.6% (8.3\u201312.9) and 9.9% (5.9\u201314.0), respectively. Age, HCV co-infection, diabetes, HIV-duration, HIV-RNA>100.000 cp/mL, antiretroviral therapy exposure were associated with LF progression at multivariate analysis. Conclusions A slight LF progression over time was observed in HIV-infected patients. No difference was demonstrated for X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains in accelerating LF evolution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Female", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Receptors, Virus", "Viral Tropism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040368153", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003735127": {"Name": "Saracino A.", "AuthorID": "7003735127", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Bari"}, "56729224700": {"Name": "Bruno G.", "AuthorID": "56729224700", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Bari"}, "7006604745": {"Name": "Monno L.", "AuthorID": "7006604745", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Bari"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}, "47062144400": {"Name": "Shanyinde M.", "AuthorID": "47062144400", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus"}, "57220937525": {"Name": "Silberstein F.C.", "AuthorID": "57220937525", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Tor Vergata"}, "6506769500": {"Name": "Nozza S.", "AuthorID": "6506769500", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "57202566978": {"Name": "Biagio A.D.", "AuthorID": "57202566978", "AffiliationID": "60107402", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Department, IRCCS San Martino Hospital"}, "6603229733": {"Name": "Cassola G.", "AuthorID": "6603229733", "AffiliationID": "60018618", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Galliera Hospital"}, "7006361490": {"Name": "Capobianchi M.", "AuthorID": "7006361490", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Virology, National Institute for Infectious Diseases \"L.
