In particular, the notions of diagonal stability and Split Lyapunov stability that have found wide success for Lotka-Volterra systems are extended for Kolmogorov systems. Several examples from theoretical ecology and evolutionary game theory are discussed to illustrate the results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attraction", "Fixed points", "Global asymptotic stability", "Heteroclinic limit cycles", "Kolmogorov systems", "Repulsion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923974581", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7201896519": {"Name": "Hou Z.", "AuthorID": "7201896519", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, London Metropolitan University"}, "57209125752": {"Name": "Baigent", "AuthorID": "57209125752", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, UCL"}}}
