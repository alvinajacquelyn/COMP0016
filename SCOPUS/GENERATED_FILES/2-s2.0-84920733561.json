Participatory urban planning ties climate change adaptation to local development opportunities. Previous discussions suggest that participatory urban planning may help to understand structural inequalities, to gain, even if temporally, institutional support and to deliver a planning process in constant negotiation with local actors. Building upon an action research project which implemented a process of participatory urban planning for climate change in Maputo, Mozambique, this paper reflects upon the practical lessons that emerged from these experiences, in relation to the incorporation of climate change information, the difficulties to secure continued support from local governments and the opportunities for local impacts through the implementation of the proposals emerging from this process.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920733561", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"18435898700": {"Name": "Broto V.C.", "AuthorID": "18435898700", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Development Planning Unit, UCL"}, "16306204400": {"Name": "Boyd E.", "AuthorID": "16306204400", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environmental Science, Reading University"}, "7004575630": {"Name": "Ensor J.", "AuthorID": "7004575630", "AffiliationID": "60016418, 60015157", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Environment Institute, University of York"}}}
