We investigated the incidence of IFD and risk factors using the revised European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Mycoses Study Group (MSG) definitions. Patients (N = 203) undergoing intensive therapy with expected neutropenia \u226510 d were recruited prospectively and followed for a median (range) of 556 (12-730) d. Baseline chest computerized tomography (CT) was performed pre-therapy. Twice-weekly surveillance with galactomannan (GM) was combined with targeted \u03b2-d-glucan (BDG) testing on patients with possible IFD or who were GM-positive. Tissue diagnosis was obtained whenever possible. The cumulative incidence of proven/probable IFD among the 202 evaluable cases after 2 years follow-up was 21%, including 14 proven and 30 probable IFDs. Using either GM or BDG as the sole biomarker (plus host and clinical evidence) the apparent overall incidence of proven/probable IFD was 11% and 16%, respectively. Combined GM/BDG detected all biopsy-proven mould IFD. Baseline CT abnormalities were found in 76/202 (38%) patients. Baseline CT abnormalities and Karnofsky score <90, monocytopenia >10 d and bacteraemia were independent risk factors associated with greater than twofold increased IFD risk. This combined diagnostic approach identified a high incidence of IFD and important risk factors in this cohort.", "AuthorKeywords": ["galactomannan", "incidence", "invasive fungal disease", "risk factors", "\u03b2-d-glucan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biopsy", "Female", "Glucans", "Hematologic Diseases", "Humans", "Male", "Mannans", "Middle Aged", "Mycoses", "Risk Factors", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027941745", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"15043849300": {"Name": "Ceesay M.M.", "AuthorID": "15043849300", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55901104100": {"Name": "Desai S.R.", "AuthorID": "55901104100", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195455042": {"Name": "Berry L.", "AuthorID": "57195455042", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200662196": {"Name": "Cleverley J.", "AuthorID": "57200662196", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005677568": {"Name": "Kibbler C.C.", "AuthorID": "7005677568", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25628213000": {"Name": "Pomplun S.", "AuthorID": "25628213000", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213082630": {"Name": "Nicholson A.G.", "AuthorID": "57213082630", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7801315826": {"Name": "Douiri A.", "AuthorID": "7801315826", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201786744": {"Name": "Wade J.", "AuthorID": "7201786744", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203756290": {"Name": "Smith M.", "AuthorID": "57203756290", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55950581200": {"Name": "Mufti G.J.", "AuthorID": "55950581200", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55403578800": {"Name": "Pagliuca A.", "AuthorID": "55403578800", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
