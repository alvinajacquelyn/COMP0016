This study compared emotion recognition in ASD in three types of emotion expression media (still image, dynamic image, auditory) across human stimuli (e.g. photo of a human face) and animated stimuli (e.g. cartoon face). Participants were 37 adolescents (age 11\u201316) with a diagnosis of ASD (33 male, 4 female). 42 males and 39 females served as typically developing, age-matched controls. Overall there was significant advantage for control groups over the ASD group for emotion recognition in human stimuli but not animated stimuli, across modalities. For static animated images specifically, those with ASD significantly outperformed controls. The findings are consistent with the ASD group using atypical explicit strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animated cartoon stimuli", "Autism spectrum disorder", "Emotion recognition", "Multimodal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Emotions", "Face", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Recognition (Psychology)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929962285", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"35551579100": {"Name": "Brosnan M.", "AuthorID": "35551579100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}, "7403244143": {"Name": "Johnson H.", "AuthorID": "7403244143", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}, "15135262900": {"Name": "Chapman E.", "AuthorID": "15135262900", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}, "56479125800": {"Name": "Grawmeyer B.", "AuthorID": "56479125800", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60117699", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "39060961100": {"Name": "Benton L.", "AuthorID": "39060961100", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60117699", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
