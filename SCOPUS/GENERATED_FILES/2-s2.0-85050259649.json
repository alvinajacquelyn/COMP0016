Unlike classical systems, a measurement on a quantum system typically alters it drastically as a result of wave function collapse. Here we suggest that this feature can be exploited for inducing quench dynamics in a many-body system while leaving its Hamiltonian unchanged. Importantly, by doing away with dedicated macroscopic devices for inducing a quench - using instead the indispensable measurement apparatus only - the protocol is expected to be easier to implement and more resilient against decoherence. By way of various case studies, we show that our scheme also has decisive advantages beyond reducing decoherence - for spectroscopy purposes and probing nonequilibrium scaling of critical and quantum impurity many-body systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Classical systems", "Many-body systems", "Measurement apparatus", "Non equilibrium", "Quantum impurity", "Quantum physics", "Quantum system", "Wave function collapse"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050259649", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8958172800": {"Name": "Bayat A.", "AuthorID": "8958172800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "36730856200": {"Name": "Alkurtass B.", "AuthorID": "36730856200", "AffiliationID": "60013183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, King Saud University"}, "7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56248410100": {"Name": "Sodano P.", "AuthorID": "56248410100", "AffiliationID": "60023857", "AffiliationName": "International Institute of Physics, Universidade Federal Do Rio Grande Do Norte"}, "7005199114": {"Name": "Johannesson H.", "AuthorID": "7005199114", "AffiliationID": "60104686", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Computational Science Research Center"}}}
