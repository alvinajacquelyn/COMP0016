A questionnaire-based survey on the determinants of hand-washing with soap and cleaning of household surfaces was conducted in at least 1000 households in each of twelve countries across the world (N = 12,239). A structural equation model of hygiene behaviour and its consequences derived from theory was then estimated on this dataset for both behaviours, using a maximum likelihood procedure. The analysis showed that the frequency of handwashing with soap is significantly related to how automatically it is performed, and whether or not someone is busy, or tired. Surface cleaning was strongly linked to possessing a cleaning routine, the perception that one is living in a dirty environment and that others are doing the behaviour, whether one has a strong sense of contamination, as well as a felt need to keep one's surroundings tidy. Being concerned with good manners is also linked to the performance of both behaviours. This study is the first to identify the role ofmanners, orderliness and routine on hygiene behaviours globally. Such findings should prove helpful in designing programs to improve domestic hygiene practices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Habits", "Hand Disinfection", "Health Behavior", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Hygiene", "International Agencies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Self Report", "Soaps", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984832178", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6603455446": {"Name": "Aunger R.", "AuthorID": "6603455446", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Health Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "28567707500": {"Name": "Greenland K.", "AuthorID": "28567707500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Health Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55391830600": {"Name": "Schmidt W.", "AuthorID": "55391830600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Health Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57206446363": {"Name": "Curtis V.", "AuthorID": "57206446363", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Health Group, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7102877671": {"Name": "Oxford J.", "AuthorID": "7102877671", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of London"}}}
