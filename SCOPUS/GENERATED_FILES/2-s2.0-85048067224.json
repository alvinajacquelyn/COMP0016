We aimed to identify metabolite profiles associated with high adherence to dietary recommendations - the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) - and the extent to which metabolites associated with AHEI also predict incident CVD. Relations between AHEI score and 80 circulating lipids and metabolites, quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics, were examined using linear regression models in the Whitehall II study (n = 4824, 55.9 \u00b1 6.1 years, 28.0% women) and were replicated in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study (n = 1716, 37.7 \u00b1 5.0 years, 56.3% women). We used Cox models to study associations between metabolites and incident CVD over the 15.8-year follow-up in the Whitehall II study. After adjustment for confounders, higher AHEI score (indicating healthier diet) was associated with higher degree of unsaturation of fatty acids (FA) and higher ratios of polyunsaturated FA, omega-3 and docosahexaenoic acid relative to total FA in both Whitehall II and Young Finns studies. A concordance of associations of metabolites with higher AHEI score and lower CVD risk was observed in Whitehall II. Adherence to healthy diet seems to be associated with specific FA that reduce risk of CVD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biological Factors", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Healthy Diet", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Male", "Metabolome", "Metabolomics", "Middle Aged", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048067224", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"15070433300": {"Name": "Akbaraly T.", "AuthorID": "15070433300", "AffiliationID": "60027946", "AffiliationName": "EPHE"}, "6603586062": {"Name": "Desrumaux C.", "AuthorID": "6603586062", "AffiliationID": "60027946", "AffiliationName": "EPHE"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60014856, 60106085, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1018, Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, H\u00f4pital Paul Brousse"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, London, University College London"}, "12769331900": {"Name": "Haapakoski R.", "AuthorID": "12769331900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, London, University College London"}, "57202382781": {"Name": "Lehto M.", "AuthorID": "57202382781", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, London, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "54879856600": {"Name": "W\u00fcrtz P.", "AuthorID": "54879856600", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Computational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oulu and Biocenter Oulu"}, "24597745500": {"Name": "Kangas A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597745500", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Computational Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oulu and Biocenter Oulu"}, "6603924570": {"Name": "Soininen P.", "AuthorID": "6603924570", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "NMR Metabolomics Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7003418142": {"Name": "Ala-Korpela M.", "AuthorID": "7003418142", "AffiliationID": "60008014, 60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences, Alfred Hospital, Monash University"}, "7006708451": {"Name": "K\u00e4h\u00f6nen M.", "AuthorID": "7006708451", "AffiliationID": "60011170, 60008760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology, University of Tampere, School of Medicine and Tampere University Hospital"}, "7004828916": {"Name": "Raitakari O.", "AuthorID": "7004828916", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Turku University Hospital"}, "7006539182": {"Name": "Lehtim\u00e4ki T.", "AuthorID": "7006539182", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Fimlab Laboratories, University of Tampere School of Medicine"}, "57202099714": {"Name": "Mikkil\u00e4 V.", "AuthorID": "57202099714", "AffiliationID": "60006876", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre of Applied and Preventive Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Turku"}, "7005545809": {"Name": "Hingorani A.", "AuthorID": "7005545809", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
