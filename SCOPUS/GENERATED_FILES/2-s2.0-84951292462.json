Using our approach, we successfully grew and released a citation web service. This web service can be invoked by existing applications to introduce a new citation counting feature. We demonstrate that GI can grow genuinely useful code in this way, so we deployed the SBSE-grown web service into widely-used publications repositories, such as the GP bibliography. In the first 24 hours of deployment alone, the service was used to provide GP bibliography citation data 369 times from 29 countries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Citation data", "Genetic improvements"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951292462", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"25822621600": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "25822621600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CREST, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7006379048": {"Name": "Harman M.", "AuthorID": "7006379048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CREST, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "8724450500": {"Name": "Langdon W.", "AuthorID": "8724450500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CREST, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56311537300": {"Name": "Marginean A.", "AuthorID": "56311537300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CREST, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
