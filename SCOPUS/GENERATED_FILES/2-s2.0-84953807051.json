The improvement in the system performance through the use of SSBI cancellation, which mitigates the nonlinear distortion caused by the square-law detection, was quantified by simulations and experiments for a 25 Gb/s N-SCM signal occupying an optical bandwidth of 8.75 GHz. A reduction of 3.6 dB in the back-to-back required OSNR at the 7% overhead HD-FEC threshold was achieved. A 1.1 dB increase in the Q2-factor after transmission over 800 km of uncompensated standard SMF was measured.", "AuthorKeywords": ["direct detection", "electronic dispersion pre-compensation", "Nyquist pulse shaping", "signal-signal beat interference cancellation", "subcarrier modulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953807051", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56703765300": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56703765300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "37028187400": {"Name": "Erkilinc M.", "AuthorID": "37028187400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602650040": {"Name": "Pachnicke S.", "AuthorID": "6602650040", "AffiliationID": "60113089", "AffiliationName": "ADVA Optical Networking SE"}, "14019344200": {"Name": "Griesser H.", "AuthorID": "14019344200", "AffiliationID": "60113089", "AffiliationName": "ADVA Optical Networking SE"}}}
