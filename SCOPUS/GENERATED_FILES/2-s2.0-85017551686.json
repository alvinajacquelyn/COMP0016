We report here a facile synthesis of graphene decorated with in-plane boron nitride domains via control of both the doping sequence of heteroatoms and the oxygen content of the graphene precursor, showing significant differences in the doping pattern compared with B and/or N singly doped or co-doped graphene. We uncover that the formation of BN domains in graphene is critical for engineering the band gap and delivering an improved activity for photocatalytic hydrogen generation in the absence of any photosensitizer. This work paves the way for the rational design and construction of graphene-based photocatalysts for efficient photocatalysis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic levels", "Facile synthesis", "Heteroatoms", "Improved activities", "Novel materials", "Oxygen content", "Photocatalytic hydrogen", "Rational design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017551686", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57145113100": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57145113100", "AffiliationID": "60103141, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University"}, "57207236600": {"Name": "Tang P.", "AuthorID": "57207236600", "AffiliationID": "60103141, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University"}, "18042811000": {"Name": "Xie J.", "AuthorID": "18042811000", "AffiliationID": "60103141, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University"}, "55443725100": {"Name": "Ma D.", "AuthorID": "55443725100", "AffiliationID": "60103141, 60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, Peking University"}, "57193928865": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57193928865", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56015403800": {"Name": "Zhao Y.", "AuthorID": "56015403800", "AffiliationID": "60026311, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Photochemical Conversion and Optoelectronic Materials, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55154571900": {"Name": "Zhao Y.", "AuthorID": "55154571900", "AffiliationID": "60026311, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Photochemical Conversion and Optoelectronic Materials, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "17436570200": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "17436570200", "AffiliationID": "60026311, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Photochemical Conversion and Optoelectronic Materials, Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57191580232": {"Name": "Xie N.", "AuthorID": "57191580232", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123072", "AffiliationName": "Innovative Catalysis Program, Key Laboratory of Organic Optoelectronics and Molecular Engineering, Department of Chemistry, Tsinghua University"}, "36551211600": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "36551211600", "AffiliationID": "60115524", "AffiliationName": "Syncat at Beijing, Synfuels China Technology Company, Ltd."}, "7401490462": {"Name": "Hu G.", "AuthorID": "7401490462", "AffiliationID": "114581170", "AffiliationName": "Israel Chemicals Limited"}}}
