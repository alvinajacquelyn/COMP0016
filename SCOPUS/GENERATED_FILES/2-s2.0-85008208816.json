On the basis of conflicting results from the two available studies, the panel rated the quality of the evidence, the harm-to-benefit ratio, patient preferences, and costs. Finally, the panel, including representatives from a patient advocate group (International Kidney Cancer Coalition) voted and reached a consensus to not recommend adjuvant therapy with sunitinib for patients with high-risk RCC after nephrectomy. Patient summary In two studies, sunitinib was given for 1 yr and compared to no active treatment (placebo) in patients who had their kidney tumour removed and who had a high risk of cancer coming back after surgery. Although one study demonstrated that 1 yr of sunitinib therapy resulted in a 1.2-yr longer time before the disease recurred, the other study did not show a benefit and it has not been shown that patients live longer. Despite having been diagnosed with high-risk disease, many patients remain without recurrence, and the side effects of sunitinib are high. Therefore, the panel members, including patient representatives, do not recommend sunitinib after tumour removal in these patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adjuvant", "Guidelines", "Management", "Renal cell cancer", "Sorafenib", "Sunitinib"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Chemotherapy, Adjuvant", "Europe", "Humans", "Indoles", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Nephrectomy", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Pyrroles", "Societies, Medical", "Urology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008208816", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"7004237921": {"Name": "Bex A.", "AuthorID": "7004237921", "AffiliationID": "60070177, 60015205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "9233462800": {"Name": "Albiges L.", "AuthorID": "9233462800", "AffiliationID": "60027386", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Medicine, Institut Gustave Roussy"}, "35408207900": {"Name": "Ljungberg B.", "AuthorID": "35408207900", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical and Perioperative Sciences, Urology and Andrology, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "6602511770": {"Name": "Bensalah K.", "AuthorID": "6602511770", "AffiliationID": "112627409", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of Rennes"}, "55086297200": {"Name": "Dabestani S.", "AuthorID": "55086297200", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "7102265783": {"Name": "Giles R.H.", "AuthorID": "7102265783", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Utrecht, Nephrology Department"}, "56156358200": {"Name": "Hofmann F.", "AuthorID": "56156358200", "AffiliationID": "60052061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Sunderby Hospital"}, "7004855950": {"Name": "Hora M.", "AuthorID": "7004855950", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Faculty Hospital and Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University in Prague"}, "55399149900": {"Name": "Kuczyk M.A.", "AuthorID": "55399149900", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Urologic Oncology, Hannover Medical School"}, "24344059800": {"Name": "Lam T.B.", "AuthorID": "24344059800", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, University of Aberdeen"}, "57203045866": {"Name": "Marconi L.", "AuthorID": "57203045866", "AffiliationID": "60019112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Coimbra University Hospital"}, "6603057236": {"Name": "Merseburger A.S.", "AuthorID": "6603057236", "AffiliationID": "60015196", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein"}, "12040220900": {"Name": "Staehler M.", "AuthorID": "12040220900", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Ludwig-Maximilians University"}, "55506372400": {"Name": "Volpe A.", "AuthorID": "55506372400", "AffiliationID": "60029535, 60003668", "AffiliationName": "Division of Urology, Maggiore della Carit\u00e0 Hospital, University of Eastern Piedmont"}, "34572458000": {"Name": "Powles T.", "AuthorID": "34572458000", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60170516, 60021435", "AffiliationName": "The Royal Free NHS Trust and Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
