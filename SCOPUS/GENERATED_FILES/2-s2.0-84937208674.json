However, the mechanism of such atom-economical transformations, and synergy with functional supports, remains poorly understood. Alkali-free Mg-Al hydrotalcites are excellent solid base catalysts for the aerobic oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), but only in concert with high concentrations of metallic gold nanoparticles. In the absence of soluble base, competitive adsorption between strongly-bound HMF and reactively-formed oxidation intermediates site-blocks gold. Aqueous NaOH dramatically promotes solution phase HMF activation, liberating free gold sites able to activate the alcohol function within the metastable 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) reactive intermediate. Synergistic effects between moderate strength base sites within alkali-free hydrotalcites and high gold surface concentrations can afford highly selective and entirely heterogeneous catalysts for aqueous phase aldehyde and alcohol cascade oxidations pertinent to biomass transformation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["5 hydroxymethyl furfurals", "Biomass transformation", "Competitive adsorption", "Heterogeneous catalyst", "Mg Al hydrotalcites", "Nanoparticulate gold", "Reactive intermediate", "Solid base catalysts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937208674", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56725822600": {"Name": "Ardemani L.", "AuthorID": "56725822600", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7405628120": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "7405628120", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "37119172200": {"Name": "Parlett C.", "AuthorID": "37119172200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7403725899": {"Name": "Wilson K.", "AuthorID": "7403725899", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "6603438328": {"Name": "Cibin G.", "AuthorID": "6603438328", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7006346007": {"Name": "Dent A.", "AuthorID": "7006346007", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55640024800": {"Name": "Parry S.", "AuthorID": "55640024800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "57190173613": {"Name": "Kyriakou G.", "AuthorID": "57190173613", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Hull"}}}
