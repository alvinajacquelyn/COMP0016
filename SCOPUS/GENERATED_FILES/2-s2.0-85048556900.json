Karger GmbH, Freiburg.Background: Dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (DDC) accounts for a small proportion of chondrosarcomas. They demonstrate aggressive behaviour with a high rate of local recurrence and systemic progression resulting in poor long-term survival rates. Due to its relatively low incidence, previous studies have grouped different histiotypes together to achieve adequate study numbers for analysis. Methods: This retrospective study examines the clinical course and the role of chemotherapy in the subgroup of patients with DDC where osteosarcoma is the predominant dedifferentiated component. Between 2000-2010, 21 patients were identified. Results: The mean age at presentation was 64 years (range 35-80 years). 12 patients were considered unfit for chemotherapy, whilst 2 patients declined chemotherapy. 5 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with less than 90% necrosis demonstrated in all these cases. 3 patients received post-operative chemotherapy. The median survival for the entire group was 9.5 months. In the 7 patients who received chemotherapy, the median survival was 17 months, and those who had chemotherapy had a greater median time to local recurrence. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that cytotoxic chemotherapy may be offered to appropriately selected patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adjuvant", "Anaplasia", "Bone neoplasm", "Chemotherapy", "Chondrosarcoma", "Necrosis", "Osteosarcoma", "Retrospective studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Bone Neoplasms", "Chondrosarcoma", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Leukopenia", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Osteosarcoma", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048556900", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"36472974700": {"Name": "Dhinsa B.S.", "AuthorID": "36472974700", "AffiliationID": "60007081", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Hospital, Orthopaedic Consultant Surge."}, "57202498221": {"Name": "Delisa M.", "AuthorID": "57202498221", "AffiliationID": "60031624, 60085015", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e0 Politecnica Delle Marche, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti Umberto i"}, "55424579500": {"Name": "Pollock R.", "AuthorID": "55424579500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7006896813": {"Name": "Flanagan A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006896813", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7202609757": {"Name": "Whelan J.", "AuthorID": "7202609757", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "London Sarcoma Service, University College Hospital"}, "26221225300": {"Name": "Gregory J.", "AuthorID": "26221225300", "AffiliationID": "60015177", "AffiliationName": "Royal Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust"}}}
