We show that this variation is constrained and that some of these mechanisms can be blocked and/or forced depending on the properties of the conjuncts. Finally, we offer the suggestion that the presence of intraindividual variation arises because of ambiguous properties of the primary linguistic data.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921477296", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"15118977800": {"Name": "Maru\u0161i\u010d F.", "AuthorID": "15118977800", "AffiliationID": "60025254", "AffiliationName": "University of Nova Gorica, Center for Cognitive Science of Language"}, "23025748800": {"Name": "Nevins A.", "AuthorID": "23025748800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Linguistics Department"}, "6603791649": {"Name": "Badecker W.", "AuthorID": "6603791649", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "University of Arizona, Cognitive Science Program"}}}
