We demonstrate that electrons within a 1D channel can be partially spin polarized as the effective length of the 1D channel is varied in agreement with the theoretical prediction. Such polarized 1D electrons when injected into a 2D region result in a split in the odd-focusing peaks, whereas the even peaks remain unaffected (single peak). On the other hand, the unpolarized electrons do not affect the focusing spectrum and the odd and even peaks remain as single peaks, respectively. The split in odd-focusing peaks is evidence of direct measurement of spin polarization within a 1D channel, where each sub-peak represents the population of a particular spin state. Confirmation of the spin splitting is determined by a selective modulation of the focusing peaks due to the Zeeman energy in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. We suggest that the SOI in the 2D regime is enhanced by a stream of polarized 1D electrons. The spatial control of spin states of injected 1D electrons and the possibility of tuning the SOI may open up a new regime of spin-engineering with application in future quantum information schemes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["spin polarization", "spin-orbit interaction", "spintronics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direct measurement", "In-plane magnetic fields", "Quantum Information", "Spatial control", "Spin engineering", "Spin orbit interactions", "Spin splittings", "Zeeman energies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041900671", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57193274229": {"Name": "Yan C.", "AuthorID": "57193274229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202530291": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "57202530291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7402627858": {"Name": "Thomas K.", "AuthorID": "7402627858", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56463590500": {"Name": "Pepper M.", "AuthorID": "56463590500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701461985": {"Name": "See P.", "AuthorID": "6701461985", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "8546355000": {"Name": "Farrer I.", "AuthorID": "8546355000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "36050490200": {"Name": "Ritchie D.", "AuthorID": "36050490200", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "57203312733": {"Name": "Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "57203312733", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "57056797900": {"Name": "Jones G.", "AuthorID": "57056797900", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}}}
