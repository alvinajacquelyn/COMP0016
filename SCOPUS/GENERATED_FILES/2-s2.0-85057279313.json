Such spontelectric fields are found in cis-methyl formate (cis-MF) and the present work combines observation of these fields with high quality ab initio studies of cis-MF monomers and dimers. This enables a prediction of the structural motif within the unit cell of the crystalline phase of solid cis-MF, showing it to be a non-polar dimer. Dimer formation at deposition temperatures of >90 K is therefore cited to contribute to the observed collapse of the spontelectric field at these temperatures. This is the first time that such a structural prediction has been made using observations of spontelectric behaviour as a key indicator.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057279313", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57200675467": {"Name": "Roman M.", "AuthorID": "57200675467", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "57200673314": {"Name": "Dunn A.", "AuthorID": "57200673314", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Q2 Solutions, Alba Campus"}, "57194050930": {"Name": "Taj S.", "AuthorID": "57194050930", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "55879534400": {"Name": "Keolopile Z.", "AuthorID": "55879534400", "AffiliationID": "60021221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Botswana"}, "55308126000": {"Name": "Rosu-Finsen A.", "AuthorID": "55308126000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56277563100": {"Name": "Gutowski M.", "AuthorID": "56277563100", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "6603830532": {"Name": "McCoustra M.", "AuthorID": "6603830532", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "54410288000": {"Name": "Cassidy A.", "AuthorID": "54410288000", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Aarhus"}, "36730399300": {"Name": "Field D.", "AuthorID": "36730399300", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Aarhus"}}}
