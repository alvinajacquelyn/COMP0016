Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of host immune responses in LTBI granulomas is essential to designing effective post-exposure therapies that inhibit progression to TB. Information arising from cancer studies and other modalities \u2013 where local chronic inflammation leads to immunopathology \u2013 can help provide insights into the biological pathways at play in LTBI granulomas. Translational studies using patient material as well as LTBI+ donor-derived tissue samples are instrumental in understanding the various components of granuloma dynamics, immunological landscapes therein and how this could help to identify therapeutic targets. Deep sequencing technologies may aid to decipher the genetic changes in lung granuloma and blood samples from LTBI+ individuals associated with progression to active TB disease. This may lead to advancement of development of targeted Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) and their evaluation as adjunct TB therapies for improving treatment outcomes for LTBI and pulmonary TB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["granuloma", "host-directed therapies", "immune landscape", "latent tuberculosis infection", "mutations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Granuloma", "Humans", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062191424", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57216111663": {"Name": "Rao M.", "AuthorID": "57216111663", "AffiliationID": "60113882", "AffiliationName": "Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown"}, "7102706668": {"Name": "Ippolito G.", "AuthorID": "7102706668", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Diseases, Lazzaro Spallanzani"}, "6603198848": {"Name": "Mfinanga S.", "AuthorID": "6603198848", "AffiliationID": "112949974", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Medical Research Muhimbili"}, "7004125689": {"Name": "Ntoumi F.", "AuthorID": "7004125689", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Tropical Medicine, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "14036737200": {"Name": "Yeboah-Manu D.", "AuthorID": "14036737200", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bacteriology, Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research"}, "6507519979": {"Name": "Vilaplana C.", "AuthorID": "6507519979", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Tuberculosis Unit (UTE), Fundaci\u00f3 Institut Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona (UAB)"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60176023, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004422039": {"Name": "Maeurer M.", "AuthorID": "7004422039", "AffiliationID": "60010405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology and Oncology, Krankenhaus Nordwest"}}}
