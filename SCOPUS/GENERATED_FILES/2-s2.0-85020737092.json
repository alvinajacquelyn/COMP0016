In turn, such interpretations and predictions are important to help mitigate risk of destruction from future large on- and offshore earthquakes similar to those that Portugal has experienced in the past (e.g. the Mw 8.5\u20138.7 tsunamigenic event in 1755). In this study, we measured teleseismic Rayleigh Wave Ellipticity (RWE) from 33 permanent and temporary seismic stations in Portugal with wave periods between 15 s and 60 s, and inverted it for 1-D models of shear wave velocity (Vs) structure beneath each station using a fully non-linear Monte Carlo method. Because RWE is strongly sensitive to the uppermost few kilometres of the crust, both RWE measurements and Vs models are spatially correlated with surface geology in Portugal. For instance, we find that sedimentary basins produced by rifting that had begun in the Mesozoic such as the Lusitanian Basin (LB) and the Lower Tagus-Sado Basin (LTSB) are characterised by higher RWE (lower Vs). Interestingly, we observe similar RWE (and Vs) values in the interior of the Central Iberian Zone (CIZ), which is a metamorphic belt of Paleozoic age. Together with reduced crustal thickness previously estimated for the same parts of the CIZ, this suggests that the CIZ might have experienced an episode of extension possibly simultaneous to Mesozoic rifting. The Galicia-Tras-os-Montes-Zone (GTMZ) that has undergone polyphased deformation since the Paleozoic is characterised by the lowest RWE (highest Vs) in Portugal. Ossa Morena Zone and the South Portuguese Zone exhibit intermediate Vs values when compared to that of basins and the GTMZ. Our crustal Vs model can be used to provide new insights into the tectonics, seismicity and strong ground motion in Portugal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geology of Portugal", "Monte Carlo inversion", "Rayleigh Wave Ellipticity", "Seismic structure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Offshore earthquake", "Portugal", "Seismic structure", "Seismicity and tectonics", "Shear velocity models", "Shear wave velocity", "South portuguese zones", "Strong ground motion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020737092", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"45861160100": {"Name": "Attanayake J.", "AuthorID": "45861160100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14119629500": {"Name": "Ferreira A.M.G.", "AuthorID": "14119629500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507260889": {"Name": "Berbellini A.", "AuthorID": "6507260889", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Faculty of Maths & Physical Sciences, University College London"}, "55724939200": {"Name": "Morelli A.", "AuthorID": "55724939200", "AffiliationID": "60000243", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia"}}}
