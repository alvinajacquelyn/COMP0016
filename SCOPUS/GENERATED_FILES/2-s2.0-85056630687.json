The composition of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire underlying this response remains poorly characterised, especially within African populations in which CMV is endemic from infancy. Here we focus on the immunodominant CD8+ T cell response to the immediate-early 2 (IE-2)-derived epitope NEGVKAAW (NW8) restricted by HLA-B*44:03, a highly prevalent response in African populations, which in some subjects represents >10% of the circulating CD8+ T cells. Using pMHC multimer staining and sorting of NW8-specific T cells, the TCR repertoire raised against NW8 was characterised here using high-throughput sequencing in 20 HLA-B*44:03 subjects. We found that the CD8+ T cell repertoire raised in response to NW8 was highly skewed and featured preferential use of a restricted set of V and J gene segments. Furthermore, as often seen in immunity against ancient viruses like CMV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the response was strongly dominated by identical TCR sequences shared by multiple individuals, or \u201cpublic\u201d TCRs. Finally, we describe a pair \u201csuperdominant\u201d TCR clonotypes, which were germline or nearly germline-encoded and produced at remarkably high frequencies in certain individuals, with a single CMV-specific clonotype representing up to 17% of all CD8+ T cells. Given the magnitude of the NW8 response, we propose that this major skewing of CMV-specific immunity leads to massive perturbations in the overall TCR repertoire in HLA-B*44:03 individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cytomegalovirus", "HLA-B*44:03", "Repertoire", "Sequencing", "T cell", "T cell receptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "African Continental Ancestry Group", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cytomegalovirus", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte", "Flow Cytometry", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "HLA-B44 Antigen", "Humans", "Immediate-Early Proteins", "Immunity, Cellular", "Immunodominant Epitopes", "Male", "Peptides", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell", "South Africa", "Trans-Activators", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056630687", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"54415325100": {"Name": "Attaf M.", "AuthorID": "54415325100", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Cardiff University School of Medicine"}, "7004981111": {"Name": "Sewell A.K.", "AuthorID": "7004981111", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University"}, "56185778900": {"Name": "Malik A.", "AuthorID": "56185778900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}, "7003741802": {"Name": "Goulder P.", "AuthorID": "7003741802", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}, "57199854604": {"Name": "Severinsen M.C.", "AuthorID": "57199854604", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60013332", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "54790224600": {"Name": "Roider J.", "AuthorID": "54790224600", "AffiliationID": "60000291, 60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of infectious diseases, Medizinische Klinik IV, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich"}, "56709641600": {"Name": "Ogongo P.", "AuthorID": "56709641600", "AffiliationID": "60037596", "AffiliationName": "Department of Tropical and Infectious Diseases, Institute of Primate Research"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung'u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7102795676": {"Name": "Leslie A.", "AuthorID": "7102795676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "16230399500": {"Name": "Kl\u00f8verpris H.N.", "AuthorID": "16230399500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55625990000": {"Name": "Buus S.", "AuthorID": "55625990000", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60013332", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "57203255155": {"Name": "Matthews P.C.", "AuthorID": "57203255155", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}}}
