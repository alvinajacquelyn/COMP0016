The excessive and long-term use of antibiotics in human cause several side effects. It is important to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of action of antibiotics in the host cell to avoid the side effects due to the prevalent uses. In the current study, we investigated the crosstalk between mitochondria and lysosomes in the presence of widely used antibiotics: erythromycin (ERM) and clindamycin (CLDM), which target the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes. We report here that both ERM and CLDM induced caspase activation and cell death in several different human cell lines. The activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain was compromised in the presence of ERM and CLDM leading to bioenergetic crisis and generation of reactive oxygen species. Antibiotics treatment impaired autophagy flux and lysosome numbers, resulting in decreased removal of damaged mitochondria through mitophagy, hence accumulation of defective mitochondria. We further show that over-expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB) increased the lysosome number, restored mitochondrial function and rescued ERM- and CLDM-induced cell death. These studies indicate that antibiotics alter mitochondria and lysosome interactions leading to apoptotsis and may develop a novel approach for targeting inter-organelle crosstalk to limit deleterious antibiotic-induced side effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiotics", "Autophagy", "Lysosome", "Mitochondria", "Side effects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Apoptosis", "Autophagosomes", "Autophagy", "Cell Line", "Clindamycin", "Erythromycin", "Humans", "Lysosomes", "Membrane Fusion", "Mitochondria", "Mitophagy", "Models, Biological", "Organelle Biogenesis", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Ribosome Subunits, Large, Bacterial"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068986464", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55358830100": {"Name": "Prajapati P.", "AuthorID": "55358830100", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, University of Kentucky"}, "57194874128": {"Name": "Dalwadi P.", "AuthorID": "57194874128", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "57201885433": {"Name": "Gohel D.", "AuthorID": "57201885433", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "57199490907": {"Name": "Singh K.", "AuthorID": "57199490907", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "55358846800": {"Name": "Sripada L.", "AuthorID": "55358846800", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "55962179600": {"Name": "Bhatelia K.", "AuthorID": "55962179600", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "57209879953": {"Name": "Joshi B.", "AuthorID": "57209879953", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "56949799700": {"Name": "Roy M.", "AuthorID": "56949799700", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "55550840300": {"Name": "Singh R.", "AuthorID": "55550840300", "AffiliationID": "60002112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bio-Chemistry, Faculty of Science, The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda"}, "53878749800": {"Name": "Singh R.", "AuthorID": "53878749800", "AffiliationID": "100773332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, School of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Indian Institute of Advanced Research"}, "57192614865": {"Name": "Wang W.X.", "AuthorID": "57192614865", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, University of Kentucky"}, "7201666195": {"Name": "Springer J.E.", "AuthorID": "7201666195", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, University of Kentucky"}}}
