The government instruments are a pension scheme and a age-independent nonlinear income tax schedule. At the second-best optimum, the pension system constrains the agents\u2019 labor supply behavior, forcing them to work to achieve a required lifetime performance. Income taxes affect labor supply directly, but also indirectly through pension incentives. The indirect effect of taxes counteracts the usual forces in the efficiency-redistribution tradeoff: through the interplay with the pension system, decreasing taxes induces redistribution and reduces productive efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033724405", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6507525968": {"Name": "Chon\u00e9 P.", "AuthorID": "6507525968", "AffiliationID": "60010447", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherche en Economie et Statistique (CREST), Universite Parris-Saclay"}, "6603798855": {"Name": "Laroque G.", "AuthorID": "6603798855", "AffiliationID": "60083821", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Sciences-Po"}}}
