An improved simplified model for insect flight mechanism is suggested and numerical methods are used to study its dynamics. The range at which the mechanism may operate is identified. The asymmetry can lead to differences in the velocity in the upward and downward movements which can be beneficial for the insect flight.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Force deflection", "Insect flight", "Restoring forces"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994092362", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55535744400": {"Name": "Abolfathi A.", "AuthorID": "55535744400", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Stewart Miller Building, Loughborough University"}, "25228200400": {"Name": "Changizi M.", "AuthorID": "25228200400", "AffiliationID": "60113602", "AffiliationName": "Intelliquip Co"}, "7402656200": {"Name": "Brennan M.", "AuthorID": "7402656200", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Departamento Do Engenharia Mec\u00e2nica, Universidade Estadual Paulista"}}}
