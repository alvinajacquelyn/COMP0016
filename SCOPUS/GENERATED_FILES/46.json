Patients can also develop other organ involvement, referred to as non-criteria manifestations, including livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia and nephropathy. Non-thrombotic inflammatory mechanisms are increasingly identified in the pathogenesis of APS, alongside a recognition that obstetric APS may be a specific subset of APS. Treatment remains focused on lifelong anticoagulation and prevention of further thrombosis or obstetric complications. Identification of novel mechanisms is, however, leading the development of diagnostic tests and more targeted therapies to improve disease management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anticardiolipin antibodies", "anticoagulation", "antiphospholipid syndrome", "complement", "lupus anticoagulant", "MRCP", "obstetric morbidity", "thrombosis", "\u03b22-Glycoprotein-1 antibodies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040367380", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56414055100": {"Name": "Clark K.E.N.", "AuthorID": "56414055100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": null}, "57216022963": {"Name": "Giles I.", "AuthorID": "57216022963", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": null}}}
