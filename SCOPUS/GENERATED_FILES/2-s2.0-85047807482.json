Here we examine nearly 500 editorials published in these two journals between 1966 and 2016 that deal with climate change, thereby constructing a lens through which to view the changing engagement of science and scientists with the issue. A systematic longitudinal frame analysis reveals broad similarities between Nature and Science in the waxing and waning of editorializing attention given to the topic, but, although both journals have diversified how they frame the challenges of climate change, they have done so in different ways. We attribute these differences to three influences: the different political and epistemic cultures into which they publish; their different institutional histories; and their different editors and editorial authorship practices.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047807482", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"7005703578": {"Name": "Hulme M.", "AuthorID": "7005703578", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cambridge"}, "57192652762": {"Name": "Obermeister N.", "AuthorID": "57192652762", "AffiliationID": "100618158", "AffiliationName": "Independent Researcher"}, "23028830600": {"Name": "Randalls S.", "AuthorID": "23028830600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "56096080800": {"Name": "Borie M.", "AuthorID": "56096080800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, King's College London"}}}
