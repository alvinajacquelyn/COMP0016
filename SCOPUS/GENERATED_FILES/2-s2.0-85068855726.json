The associated inverse problems involve two steps, namely acoustic and optical, which can be solved separately or as a direct composite problem. We adopt the latter approach for realistic acoustic media that possess heterogeneous and often not accurately known distributions for sound speed and ambient density, as well as an attenuation following a frequency power law that is evident in tissue media. We use a diffusion approximation (DA) model for the optical portion of the problem. We solve the corresponding composite inverse problem using three total variation (TV) regularised optimisation approaches. Accordingly, we develop two Krylov-subspace inexact-Newton algorithms that utilise the Jacobian matrix in a matrix-free manner in order to handle the computational cost. Additionally, we use a gradient-based algorithm that computes a search direction using the L-BFGS method, and applies a TV regularisation based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) as a benchmark, because this method is popular for QPAT and direct QPAT. The results indicate the superiority of the developed inexact Newton algorithms over gradient-based quasi-Newton approaches for a comparable computational complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternating direction method of multipliers", "Computational costs", "Diffusion approximations", "Gradient based algorithm", "Krylov sub spaces", "Optical attenuation", "Photoacoustic tomography", "Search direction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068855726", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57217338029": {"Name": "Javaherian A.", "AuthorID": "57217338029", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35102289500": {"Name": "Holman S.", "AuthorID": "35102289500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Manchester"}}}
