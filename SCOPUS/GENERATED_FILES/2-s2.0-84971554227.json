The convention of this technique is the growth of anchorage dependent cells on the 2-dimensional surface of tissue culture plastic. More recently, there is a growing body of data demonstrating more in vivo-like behaviors of cells grown in 3-dimensional culture systems. This manuscript describes in detail the set-up and operation of a hollow fiber bioreactor system for the in vivo-like culture of mammalian cells. The hollow fiber bioreactor system delivers media to the cells in a manner akin to the delivery of blood through the capillary networks in vivo. The system is designed to fit onto the shelf of a standard CO2 incubator and is simple enough to be set-up by any competent cell biologist with a good understanding of aseptic technique. The systems utility is demonstrated by culturing the hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2/C3A for 7 days. Further to this and in line with other published reports on the functionality of cells grown in 3-dimensional culture systems the cells are shown to possess increased albumin production (an important hepatic function) when compared to standard 2-dimensional tissue culture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D cell culture", "Albumin secretion", "Bioengineering", "Cell culture", "Hepatocyte", "HepG2/C3A", "Hollow fiber bioreactor", "Issue 111", "Tissue culture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bioreactors", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Liver Neoplasms", "Tissue Culture Techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971554227", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"16232016300": {"Name": "Storm M.", "AuthorID": "16232016300", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Bath"}, "55903741400": {"Name": "Luetchford K.", "AuthorID": "55903741400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Bath"}, "8582136100": {"Name": "Ellis M.", "AuthorID": "8582136100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Bath"}, "12779518300": {"Name": "Sorrell I.", "AuthorID": "12779518300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science and Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "35088718100": {"Name": "Regan S.", "AuthorID": "35088718100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science and Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "57172715500": {"Name": "Sathish J.", "AuthorID": "57172715500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science and Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "24921854100": {"Name": "Shipley R.", "AuthorID": "24921854100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "35585509500": {"Name": "Webb S.", "AuthorID": "35585509500", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics, Liverpool John Moores University"}}}
