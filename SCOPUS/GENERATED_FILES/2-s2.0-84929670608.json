Restoring their function may not only control inflammation but also restore tolerance in these patients. Biologic therapies have been tremendously successful in treating RA. Here we review numerous reports suggesting that these immunomodulatory therapies have an impact on Treg and that this may contribute to their beneficial effects. Better understanding of their mode of action may not only lead to improvements in therapies and sustained remission but also enable the development of biomarkers of response, which would be the first steps towards personalized medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-TNF therapy", "Biologic therapy", "Regulatory T cells", "Rheumatoid arthritis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929670608", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6503908322": {"Name": "Byng-Maddick R.", "AuthorID": "6503908322", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University College London"}, "7004262550": {"Name": "Ehrenstein M.", "AuthorID": "7004262550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University College London"}}}
