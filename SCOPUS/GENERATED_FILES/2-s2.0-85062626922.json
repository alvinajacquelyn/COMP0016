We also present evidence that Br ions prefer to occupy the bridging halide position within the layers in order to minimize strain within the lattice that results from the incorporation of the significantly larger iodide anions into the lattice. These results not only quantify the upper limit for I content in the layered polymorph, but also establish the minimum band gap obtainable from these Bi-based phases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062626922", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57207583541": {"Name": "Hodgkins T.L.", "AuthorID": "57207583541", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "56423439900": {"Name": "Bass K.K.", "AuthorID": "56423439900", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "57207574347": {"Name": "Seckman B.L.", "AuthorID": "57207574347", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "6603852629": {"Name": "Djurovich P.I.", "AuthorID": "6603852629", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "7404620831": {"Name": "Thompson M.E.", "AuthorID": "7404620831", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "13408899600": {"Name": "Melot B.C.", "AuthorID": "13408899600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "56545348200": {"Name": "Savory C.N.", "AuthorID": "56545348200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}}}
