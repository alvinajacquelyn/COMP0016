Unlike strain, which is commonly imaged in compression elastography, elastic moduli are intrinsic properties of tissue, and therefore, this approach reconstructs images that are largely operator and system independent, enabling objective, longitudinal, and multisite diagnoses. Recently, novel quantitative elasticity imaging approaches to compression elastography have been developed. These methods use a calibration layer with known mechanical properties to sense the stress at the tissue surface, which combined with strain, is used to estimate the tissue's elastic moduli by assuming homogeneity in the stress field. However, this assumption is violated in mechanically heterogeneous samples. We present a more general approach to quantitative elasticity imaging that overcomes this limitation through an efficient iterative solution of the inverse elasticity problem using adjoint elasticity equations. We present solutions for linear elastic, isotropic, and incompressible solids; however, this method can be employed for more complex mechanical models. We retrieve the spatial distribution of shear modulus for a tissue-simulating phantom and a tissue sample. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the iterative solution of the inverse elasticity problem has been implemented on experimentally acquired compression optical coherence elastography data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compression optical coherence elastography", "inverse elasticity problems", "optical coherence tomography", "quantitative elasticity imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Elasticity equations", "Elasticity imaging", "Incompressible solids", "Intrinsic property", "Inverse elasticity problems", "Iterative solutions", "Optical coherence elastography", "Tissue simulating phantoms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963860094", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57188858755": {"Name": "Dong L.", "AuthorID": "57188858755", "AffiliationID": "60025534", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computation Research Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}, "57188860369": {"Name": "Dantuono J.T.", "AuthorID": "57188860369", "AffiliationID": "60025534", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computation Research Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}, "7003592854": {"Name": "Oberai A.A.", "AuthorID": "7003592854", "AffiliationID": "60025534", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Computation Research Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}, "56434153900": {"Name": "Wijesinghe P.", "AuthorID": "56434153900", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Optical+Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia"}, "7103073866": {"Name": "Sampson D.D.", "AuthorID": "7103073866", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Microscopy, Characterisation and Analysis, University of Western Australia"}, "15923062800": {"Name": "Kennedy B.F.", "AuthorID": "15923062800", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Optical+Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia"}, "7102012051": {"Name": "Munro P.R.T.", "AuthorID": "7102012051", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical, Electronic, and Computer Engineering, University of Western Australia"}}}
