Although several clinical and radiological factors increase the risk of rtPA-related ICH, none of the currently available risk prediction tools are yet useful for practical clinical decision-making, probably reflecting our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Finding new methods to identify patients at highest risk of rtPArelated ICH, or new measures to limit risk, are urgent challenges in acute stroke therapy research. In this article, we focus on the potential underlying mechanisms of rtPA-related ICH, highlight promising candidate risk biomarkers and suggest future research directions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Brain Ischemia", "Cerebral Hemorrhage", "Fibrinolytic Agents", "Humans", "Plasminogen Activators", "Stroke", "Thrombolytic Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942098230", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8945172200": {"Name": "Karaszewski B.", "AuthorID": "8945172200", "AffiliationID": "60012383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Adult Neurology, Medical University of Gdansk, University Clinical Centre"}, "36676862000": {"Name": "Charidimou A.", "AuthorID": "36676862000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Stroke Research Group"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Stroke Research Group"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London, Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "35555948100": {"Name": "Smith E.E.", "AuthorID": "35555948100", "AffiliationID": "60192954, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary"}, "7102054556": {"Name": "Markus H.S.", "AuthorID": "7102054556", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "26643279200": {"Name": "Levi C.", "AuthorID": "26643279200", "AffiliationID": "60010571, 60014427", "AffiliationName": "Acute Stroke Services, University of Newcastle, John Hunter Hospital"}}}
