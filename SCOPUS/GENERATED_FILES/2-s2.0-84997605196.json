The aim is to provide a readily accessible quick and easy update for urologists, nephrologists and endocrine or metabolic physicians whose practice involves the diagnosis and management of nephrolithiasis. An important message is to always consider a seemingly rare, and usually genetic, cause of kidney stones, since some of these are emerging as more common than originally thought, especially in adult clinical practice in which a family history of stones is a common finding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mutation", "Nephrocalcinosis", "Nephrolithiasis", "Urolithiasis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Kidney Calculi", "Kidney Diseases", "Kidney Tubules", "Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997605196", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"13006329500": {"Name": "Mohebbi N.", "AuthorID": "13006329500", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, University Hospital Zurich"}, "25724310200": {"Name": "Ferraro P.", "AuthorID": "25724310200", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Division, Institute of Internal Medicine, Catholic University"}, "35597500900": {"Name": "Gambaro G.", "AuthorID": "35597500900", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Division, Institute of Internal Medicine, Catholic University"}, "8234615900": {"Name": "Unwin R.", "AuthorID": "8234615900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}}}
