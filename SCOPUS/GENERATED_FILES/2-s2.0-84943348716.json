All rights reserved.Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and are members of the 'Cys-loop' family of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs). Acetylcholine binds in the receptor extracellular domain at the interface between two subunits and research has identified a large number of nAChR-selective ligands, including agonists and competitive antagonists, that bind at the same site as acetylcholine (commonly referred to as the orthosteric binding site). In addition, more recent research has identified ligands that are able to modulate nAChR function by binding to sites that are distinct from the binding site for acetylcholine, including sites located in the transmembrane domain. These include positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), silent allosteric modulators (SAMs) and compounds that are able to activate nAChRs via an allosteric binding site (allosteric agonists). Our aim in this article is to review important aspects of the pharmacological diversity of nAChR allosteric modulators and to describe recent evidence aimed at identifying binding sites for allosteric modulators on nAChRs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allosteric modulation", "Ion channel", "Neurotransmitter-gated ion channel", "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor", "Receptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Humans", "Molecular Structure", "Nicotinic Agonists", "Nicotinic Antagonists", "Receptors, Nicotinic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943348716", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55595777100": {"Name": "Chatzidaki A.", "AuthorID": "55595777100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006347978": {"Name": "Millar N.", "AuthorID": "7006347978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
