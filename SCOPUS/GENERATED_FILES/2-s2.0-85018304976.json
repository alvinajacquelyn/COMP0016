We wished to determine whether there was an association between resting energy expenditure (REE) and total energy expenditure (TEE) in HD patients and body composition. Subjects/methods: We determined REE by recently validated equations (CKD equation) and compared REE with that estimated by standard equations for REE, and TEE calculated from patient reported physical activity, in HD patients with corresponding body composition measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning. Results: We studied 107 patients, 69 male (64.5%), mean age 62.7 \u00b1 15.1 years. The CKD equation REE was 72.5 \u00b1 13.3 watts (W) and TEE 83.2 \u00b1 9.7 W. There was a strong association between REE with body surface area (BSA) (r2 = 0.80), total soft lean and fat lean tissue mass (r2 = 0.69), body mass index (BMI) (r2 = 0.34), all p<0.001. REE estimated using the modified Harris Benedict, Mifflin St. Jeor, Katch McArdle, Bernstein and Robertson equations underestimated REE compared to the CKD equation. TEE was more strongly associated with BSA (r2 = 0.51), appendicular muscle mass (r2 = 0.42), than BMI (r2 = 0.15) all p<0.001. TEE was greater for those employed (104.9 \u00b1 10.7 vs. 83.1 \u00b1 12.3 W, p<0.001), and with no co-morbidity (88.7 \u00b1 14.8 vs. 82.7 \u00b1 12.3 W, p<0.05). Conclusions: Standard equations underestimate REE in HD patients compared to the CKD equation. TEE was greater in those with more skeletal muscle mass, in those who were employed and in those with the least comorbidity. More metabolically active patients may well require greater dialytic clearances.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body composition", "DXA", "Haemodialysis", "Kt/V urea", "Resting energy expenditure", "Total energy expenditure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Body Fat Distribution", "Body Mass Index", "Body Surface Area", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Biological", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Renal Dialysis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Statistics as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018304976", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57194002422": {"Name": "Hung R.", "AuthorID": "57194002422", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}, "23013648000": {"Name": "Sridharan S.", "AuthorID": "23013648000", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Renal Unit, Lister Hospital"}, "7006817812": {"Name": "Farrington K.", "AuthorID": "7006817812", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "University of Hertfordshire"}}}
