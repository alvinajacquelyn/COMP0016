The Ag clustering mechanism is vital for understanding device operation and at this stage is unknown. In this paper an O vacancy (Vo) mediated cluster model is presented, where the Vo is identified as the principle site for Ag+ reduction. The Ag+ interstitial is energetically favored at the Fermi energies of Ag and Pt, indicating that Ag+ ions are not reduced at the Pt electrode via electron tunneling. Instead, Ag+ ions bind to Vo forming the [Ag/Vo]+ complex, reducing Ag+ via charge transfer from the Si atoms in the vacancy. The [Ag/Vo]+ complex is then able to trap an electron forming [Ag/Vo]0 at the Fermi energy of Pt. This complex is then able to act as a nucleation site for of Ag clustering with the formation of [Ag2/Vo]^+ which is reduced by the above mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amorphous silica", "Cluster models", "Clustering mechanism", "Device operations", "Nucleation sites", "Pt electrode", "Resistive random access memory (rram)", "Theoretical study"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053889485", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57203980753": {"Name": "Patel K.", "AuthorID": "57203980753", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "57189512233": {"Name": "Cottom J.", "AuthorID": "57189512233", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007118546": {"Name": "Shluger A.", "AuthorID": "7007118546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7007004212": {"Name": "Bosman M.", "AuthorID": "7007004212", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, National University of Singapore"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
