This technique enables the inference of the inner chemical composition of the scanned sample, and therefore can be used to identify or classify objects. In this paper, we describe how to facilitate the use of NIRS by nonexpert users in everyday settings. Our work highlights the key challenges of placing NIRS devices in the hands of nonexperts. We develop a system to mitigate these challenges, and evaluate it in a user study. We show how NIRS technology can be successfully utilised by untrained users in an unsupervised manner through a special enclosure and an accompanying smartphone app. Finally, we discuss potential future developments of commoditised NIRS.
