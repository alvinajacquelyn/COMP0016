Modelling of these structural changes presents a serious theoretical challenge when the solid and gas species are treated in an even handed way. This exactly solvable model complements other simulation based approaches. The methodology presented here highlights the competition between the potential for adsorption and the energy required for structural transition as a driving force for the features in the adsorption isotherms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adsorbates and surfactants (theory)", "Rigorous results in statistical mechanics", "Solvable lattice models"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929095108", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"7006896676": {"Name": "Dunne L.", "AuthorID": "7006896676", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "7004913362": {"Name": "Manos G.", "AuthorID": "7004913362", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
