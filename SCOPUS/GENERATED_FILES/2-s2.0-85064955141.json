However, studies are solely based on single measurements in the acute phase of an ACS event. The way GDF-15 patterns in post-ACS patients behave on the long term is largely unknown. We conducted a nested case-control study within our multicenter, prospective, observational biomarker study (BIOMArCS)of 844 ACS patients. Following an index ACS event, high-frequency blood sampling was performed during 1-year of follow-up. GDF-15 was determined batchwise by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays in 37 cases with a recurrent event during 1-year follow-up, and in 74 event-free controls. Cases and controls had a mean \u00b1 standard deviation age of 66.9 \u00b1 11.3 years and 81% were men. From 30 days onwards, patients showed stable levels, which were on average 333 (95% confidence interval 68 to 647)pg/mL higher in cases than controls (1704 vs 1371 pg/mL; p value 0.013). Additionally, in the post 30-day period, GDF-15 showed low within-individual variability in both cases and controls. In conclusion, post-ACS patients experiencing a recurrent event had stable and systematically higher GDF-15 levels during 30-day to 1-year follow-up than their event-free counterparts with otherwise similar clinical characteristics. Thus, postdischarge blood sampling might be used throughout the course of 1 year to improve prognostication, whereas, in view of the low within-individual variation, the number of repeated sampling moments might be limited.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Coronary Syndrome", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Growth Differentiation Factor 15", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064955141", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56319645000": {"Name": "Buljubasic N.", "AuthorID": "56319645000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "57200413457": {"Name": "Vroegindewey M.", "AuthorID": "57200413457", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "24172653000": {"Name": "Oemrawsingh R.", "AuthorID": "24172653000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "6602755087": {"Name": "Akkerhuis K.", "AuthorID": "6602755087", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "7102815542": {"Name": "Boersma E.", "AuthorID": "7102815542", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Division Heart & Lungs, Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "39961221200": {"Name": "Cramer E.", "AuthorID": "39961221200", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7006066944": {"Name": "Liem A.", "AuthorID": "7006066944", "AffiliationID": "60070150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Sint Franciscus Gasthuis"}, "6602378288": {"Name": "van der Harst P.", "AuthorID": "6602378288", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "7101924829": {"Name": "Maas A.", "AuthorID": "7101924829", "AffiliationID": "60085425", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Gelre Hospitals"}, "6603110779": {"Name": "Ronner E.", "AuthorID": "6603110779", "AffiliationID": "60000525", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Reinier de Graaf"}, "6603600517": {"Name": "Schotborgh C.", "AuthorID": "6603600517", "AffiliationID": "60070161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, HagaZiekenhuis"}, "6602729434": {"Name": "Wardeh A.", "AuthorID": "6602729434", "AffiliationID": "122043158", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Haaglanden Medical Center"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
