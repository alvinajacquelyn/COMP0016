Evolution \u00a9 2018 The Society for the Study of Evolution.The signature of sexual selection has been revealed through the study of differences in patterns of genome-wide gene expression, both between the sexes and between alternative reproductive morphs within a single sex. What remains unclear, however, is whether differences in gene expression patterns between individuals of a given sex consistently map to variation in individual quality. Such a pattern, particularly if found in males, would provide unambiguous evidence that the phenotypic response to sexual selection is shaped through sex-specific alterations to the transcriptome. To redress this knowledge gap, we explored whether patterns of sex-biased gene expression are associated with variation in male reproductive quality in Drosophila melanogaster. We measured two male reproductive phenotypes, and their association with sex-biased gene expression, across a selection of inbred lines from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. Genotypes with higher expression of male-biased genes produced males exhibiting shorter latencies to copulation, and higher capacity to inseminate females. Conversely, female-biased genes tended to show negative associations with these male reproductive traits across genotypes. We uncovered similar patterns, by reanalyzing a published dataset from a second D. melanogaster population. Our results reveal the footprint of sexual selection in masculinising the male transcriptome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DGRP", "gene expression", "sex-biased genes", "sexual conflict", "sexual selection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Evolution, Molecular", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Male", "Selection, Genetic", "Sex Characteristics", "Sexual Behavior, Animal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055734421", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"16240675400": {"Name": "Dean R.", "AuthorID": "16240675400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57204479590": {"Name": "Hammer C.", "AuthorID": "57204479590", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Monash University"}, "57204479704": {"Name": "Higham V.", "AuthorID": "57204479704", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Monash University"}, "7006040381": {"Name": "Dowling D.", "AuthorID": "7006040381", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Monash University"}}}
