The mechanism was constructed in steps. An improved C5-C7 submechanism (26 species and 90 reactions) was first developed to describe fuel-cracking to form smaller fragments under high temperatures. Five modules of the C5-C7 submechanism were considered separately, and the rate constants were carefully estimated. A semiglobal low-temperature submechanism was developed to improve prediction of the negative temperature coefficient behaviors, which contained 4 species and 11 reactions. Isomers of intermediate radicals and fast reactions were lumped to obtain the minimal low-temperature submechanism. Combined with a simplified C0-C4 kernel (40 species and 276 reactions), the final mechanism consists of 70 species and 377 reactions. Validations of the newly developed mechanism were performed using amounts of experimental data, including ignition delays in shock tubes and rapid compression machines, under a wide range of temperatures (650-2000 K), pressures (1-50 atm), and equivalence ratios (0.5-2.0), and OH concentration histories in high pressure shock tubes. Furthermore, experimental data of species concentrations and flame speeds in laminar premixed flames were also used for validation. The present mechanism showed good accuracy in predicting ignition and combustion properties over a range of parameters. Simulations using other detailed MCH mechanisms were also carried out for comparison.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical kinetic mechanism", "Chemical mechanism", "Combustion property", "Equivalence ratios", "High pressure shock tubes", "Laminar premixed flames", "Rapid compression machine", "Species concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032853255", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55208470000": {"Name": "Yao T.", "AuthorID": "55208470000", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Tsinghua University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102853643": {"Name": "Zhong B.J.", "AuthorID": "7102853643", "AffiliationID": "60025278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Mechanics, Tsinghua University"}}}
