An asymmetric wormhole geometry is obtained where the metric coefficients has a linear term for galactic distances and the analysis of Mannheim and collaborators, can then be used to describe the galactic rotation curves. For cosmological distances a de-Sitter space-time is realized. Center of gravity coordinates for the wormhole are introduced which are the most suitable for the collective motion of a wormhole. The wormholes connect universes with different vacuum energy densities which may represent different universes in a \u201clandscape scenario\u201d. The metric coefficients depend on the asymmetric wormhole parameters. The coefficient of the linear potential is proportional to both the mass of the wormhole and the cosmological constant of the observed universe. Similar results are also expected in other theories like k-essence theories, that may support wormholes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymmetric wormholes", "Diffusive action", "Galactic rotation curves", "Two measure theories"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064403613", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55811800800": {"Name": "Bahamonde S.", "AuthorID": "55811800800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57191512739": {"Name": "Benisty D.", "AuthorID": "57191512739", "AffiliationID": "60083550", "AffiliationName": "Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, Giersch Science Center, Campus Riedberg"}, "7003448373": {"Name": "Guendelman E.", "AuthorID": "7003448373", "AffiliationID": "121066857", "AffiliationName": "Bahamas Advanced Study Institute and Conferences"}}}
