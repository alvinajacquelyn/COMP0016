In this work, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), P(3HB), and poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate), P(3HO), have been combined to form blend fibres for directional guidance of neuronal cell growth and differentiation. A 25:75 P(3HO)/P(3HB) blend (PHA blend) was used for the manufacturing of electrospun fibres as resorbable scaffolds to be used as internal guidance lumen structures in nerve conduits. The biocompatibility of these fibres was studied using neuronal and Schwann cells. Highly aligned and uniform fibres with varying diameters were fabricated by controlling electrospinning parameters. The resulting fibre diameters were 2.4 \u00b1 0.3, 3.7 \u00b1 0.3, and 13.5 \u00b1 2.3 \u03bcm for small, medium, and large diameter fibres, respectively. The cell response to these electrospun fibres was investigated with respect to growth and differentiation. Cell migration observed on the electrospun fibres showed topographical guidance in accordance with the direction of the fibres. The correlation between fibre diameter and neuronal growth under two conditions, individually and in coculture with Schwann cells, was evaluated. Results obtained from both assays revealed that all PHA blend fibre groups were able to support growth and guide aligned distribution of neuronal cells, and there was a direct correlation between the fibre diameter and neuronal growth and differentiation. This work has led to the development of a family of unique biodegradable and highly biocompatible 3D substrates capable of guiding and facilitating the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of neuronal cells as internal structures within nerve conduits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electrospun fibres", "nerve regeneration", "peripheral nerves", "polyhydroxyalkanoates", "topographical guidance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Cell Proliferation", "Humans", "Neuronal Outgrowth", "Neurons", "Polyhydroxyalkanoates", "Schwann Cells", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068511929", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56712825700": {"Name": "Lizarraga-Valderrama L.R.", "AuthorID": "56712825700", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Applied Biotechnology Research Group, School of Life Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Westminster"}, "57213789119": {"Name": "Roy I.", "AuthorID": "57213789119", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Applied Biotechnology Research Group, School of Life Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Westminster"}, "56543899300": {"Name": "Taylor C.S.", "AuthorID": "56543899300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "55987061100": {"Name": "Claeyssens F.", "AuthorID": "55987061100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "35237001100": {"Name": "Haycock J.W.", "AuthorID": "35237001100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman-Korea Dental Medicine Innovation Centre, Dankook University"}}}
