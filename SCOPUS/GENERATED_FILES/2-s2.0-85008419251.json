A simple cross-validation procedure based on minimising predictive risk is presented as a means to estimate tuning parameters. Through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) data, we attempt to use such a procedure to build a generative (multi-resolution) model of the electrical dynamics in the brain throughout an epileptic seizure. Brain dynamics are analysed by projecting the estimated model parameters onto their principle components where we identify two clusters of seizure activity. To conclude, we discuss the interpretation of such a principle component analysis and how well we can generalise between seizures on a specific patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Graphical Model", "Regularisation", "Robust", "Time-series", "Wavelet"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comparative studies", "GraphicaL model", "Principle component", "Principle component analysis", "Real world situations", "Regularisation", "Robust", "Wavelet"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008419251", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56304285200": {"Name": "Gibberd A.J.", "AuthorID": "56304285200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Statistical Science, Department of Security and Crime Science"}, "57213634767": {"Name": "Nelson J.D.B.", "AuthorID": "57213634767", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Statistical Science"}}}
