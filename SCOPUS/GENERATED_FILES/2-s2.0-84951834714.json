Unfortunately, it is made difficult by poor image quality due to sparse acquisition, inter-slice motion, and the widely varying position and orientation of the placenta between pregnant women. We propose a minimally interactive online learning-based method named Slic-Seg to obtain accurate placenta segmentations from MRI. An online random forest is first trained on data coming from scribbles provided by the user in one single selected start slice. This then forms the basis for a slice-by-slice framework that segments subsequent slices before incorporating them into the training set on the fly. The proposed method was compared with its offline counterpart that is with no retraining, and with two other widely used interactive methods. Experiments show that our method 1) has a high performance in the start slice even in cases where sparse scribbles provided by the user lead to poor results with the competitive approaches, 2) has a robust segmentation in subsequent slices, and 3) results in less variability between users.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Interactive methods", "Online learning", "Position and orientations", "Pregnant woman", "Random forests", "Robust segmentation", "Segmentation propagation", "Surgical procedures"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951834714", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55682589900": {"Name": "Wang G.", "AuthorID": "55682589900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "16551520500": {"Name": "Zuluaga M.", "AuthorID": "16551520500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "56780998200": {"Name": "Pratt R.", "AuthorID": "56780998200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "55308237500": {"Name": "Aertsen M.", "AuthorID": "55308237500", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University Hospitals KU Leuven"}, "7006218373": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "7006218373", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics, University Hospitals KU Leuven"}}}
