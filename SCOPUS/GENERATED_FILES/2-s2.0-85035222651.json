This study sees the novel application of the MPAG framework to a small-scale mangrove crab fishery in northwest Madagascar. The country typifies developing country environmental governance challenges, due to its poverty, political instability and lack of state capacity, with bottom-up approaches often identified as a potential solution. In this context, small-scale fisheries (SSF) play a vital role in food security and poverty alleviation but are vulnerable to over-exploitation. The case study examines community-based management, including the role of three nascent fishing association managing portions of the fishery, within a mangrove ecosystem. Despite issues with underrepresentation of fishers in local resource management organizations that have partial responsibility for the mangrove habitats, some management measures and incentives have been applied, including the replantation of mangroves and fishery-wide gear restrictions. However, the analysis highlights market forces and migration are drivers with negative synergistic effects that cannot be controlled by bottom-up management. Incentives identified as needed or in need or strengthening require the support of external actors, the state, industry and or NGO(s). Thus, governance approaches should seek integration and move away from polarised solutions (top-down vs- bottom-up). As shown by other MPAG case studies, effective governance is dependent on achieving 'resilience through diversity', in terms of the diversity of both the actors and the incentives they are able to collectively employ.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Governance", "Locally managed marine area", "Madagascar", "Mangrove", "Scylla serrata", "Small-scale fishery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035222651", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57206631332": {"Name": "Long S.", "AuthorID": "57206631332", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "55474784800": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "55474784800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "57194054904": {"Name": "Randriana Z.", "AuthorID": "57194054904", "AffiliationID": "118435574", "AffiliationName": null}, "57197842422": {"Name": "Hadj-Hammou J.", "AuthorID": "57197842422", "AffiliationID": "60117630, 60023643", "AffiliationName": null}}}
