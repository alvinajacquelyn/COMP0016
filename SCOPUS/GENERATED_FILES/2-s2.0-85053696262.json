Historical blocks are usually built and designed based on the social environment and climatic conditions at that time; therefore, they generally contain the construction techniques relevant to dealing with the local climate. The study aims to study the microclimate characteristics of a historic conservation area in a severe cold region and to explore how it attempted to achieve climate adaptation. Taking the Chinese-Baroque historic conservation area in Harbin as an example, this paper analyzed and studied the climate adaptability technology and excavated the suitable technology for the block to deal with a severe cold climate through research, field measurements, and numerical simulation. The results showed that compared with a certain modern urban area in the city, the Chinese-Baroque historic conservation area had better ability to resist wind and cold. The compact layout of the block could reduce heat loss and keep out the cold by effectively resisting the cold wind from permeating inside. Compared with the T-shaped and L-shaped courtyards, the rectangular courtyard occupies the largest proportion and a rectangular courtyard enclosed by buildings on all sides had better windbreak performance. Furthermore, when the courtyard space was enclosed by four sides and the courtyard width was the same, when the plane aspect ratio was smaller, the maximum wind speed of the inner courtyard was smaller. The squares in the block had a good performance in cold resistance. At the same scale, the higher the degree of enclosure of the square, the lower the internal wind speed. This study will provide a reference for urban planning and architectural design in severe cold regions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate adaptability technology", "Historical block", "Microclimate", "Severe cold region"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053696262", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"27168583800": {"Name": "Jin H.", "AuthorID": "27168583800", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Heilongjiang Cold Region Architectural Science Key Laboratory, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57191639369": {"Name": "Zhao J.", "AuthorID": "57191639369", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Heilongjiang Cold Region Architectural Science Key Laboratory, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "57196328898": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "57196328898", "AffiliationID": "60019616", "AffiliationName": "Heilongjiang Cold Region Architectural Science Key Laboratory, School of Architecture, Harbin Institute of Technology"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, The Bartlett, University College London (UCL)"}}}
