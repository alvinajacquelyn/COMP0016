We use the Determinants of young Adult Social well-being and Health (DASH), the largest UK longitudinal study of ethnically diverse young people, to address the following questions: a) Is racism associated with smoking? b) Does the relationship between racism and smoking vary by gender and by ethnicity? (c) Do religious involvement, parenting style and relationship with parents modify any observed relationship? and d) What are the qualitative experiences of racism and how might family or religion buffer the impact? Methods The cohort was recruited from 51 London schools. 6643 were seen at 11-13y and 4785 seen again at 14-16y. 665 participated in pilot follow-up at 21-23y, 42 in qualitative interviews. Self-report questionnaires included lifestyles, socio-economic and psychosocial factors. Mixed-effect models examined the associations between racism and smoking. Results Smoking prevalence increased from adolescence to age 21-23y, although ethnic minorities remained less likely to smoke. Racism was an independent longitudinal correlate of ever smoking throughout adolescence (odds ratio 1.77, 95% Confidence Interval 1.45\u20132.17) and from early adolescence to early 20s (1.90, 95% CI 1.25\u20132.90). Smoking initiation in late adolescence was associated with cumulative exposure to racism (1.77, 95% CI 1.23\u20132.54). Parent-child relationships and place of worship attendance were independent longitudinal correlates that were protective of smoking. Qualitative narratives explored how parenting, religion and cultural identity buffered the adverse impact of racism. Conclusions Racism was associated with smoking behaviour from early adolescence to early adulthood, regardless of gender, ethnicity or socio-economic circumstances adding to evidence of the need to consider racism as an important social determinant of health across the life course.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041110051", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36610513200": {"Name": "Read U.M.", "AuthorID": "36610513200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health Sciences, School of Life Course Sciences, Kings College London"}, "57189076498": {"Name": "Silva M.J.", "AuthorID": "57189076498", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health Sciences, School of Life Course Sciences, Kings College London"}, "57200399511": {"Name": "Kennedy Cruickshank J.", "AuthorID": "57200399511", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health Sciences, School of Life Course Sciences, Kings College London"}, "35598815100": {"Name": "Harding S.", "AuthorID": "35598815100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health Sciences, School of Life Course Sciences, Kings College London"}, "57189071023": {"Name": "Karamanos A.", "AuthorID": "57189071023", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60099295", "AffiliationName": "ESRC, International Centre for Lifecourse Studies in Society and Health, Department of Epidemiology and Health, University College London"}, "55251729300": {"Name": "Molaodi O.R.", "AuthorID": "55251729300", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60005028", "AffiliationName": "MRC/CSO, Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "56589606800": {"Name": "Cassidy A.", "AuthorID": "56589606800", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60005028", "AffiliationName": "MRC/CSO, Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "6508324646": {"Name": "Enayat Z.E.", "AuthorID": "6508324646", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
