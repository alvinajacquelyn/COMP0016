The transmission can occur through a global banking channel in which global banks intermediate wholesale funding to local banks. Changes in financial conditions are passed across borders through the banks\u2019 balance-sheet exposure to credit, currency, maturity, and funding risks resulting in house price spillovers. While controlling for country-level and global factors, we find significant co-movement across housing markets of countries with proportionally high bank integration. Bank integration can better capture house price co-movements than other measures of economic integration. Once we account for bank exposure, other spatial linkages traditionally used to account for return co-movements across region \u2013 such as trade, foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, geographic proximity, etc. \u2013 become insignificant. Moreover, we find that the co-movement across housing markets decreases for countries with less developed mortgage markets characterized by fixed mortgage rate contracts, low limits of loan-to-value ratios and no mortgage equity withdrawal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bank capital flows", "Bank integration", "Dynamic spatial panel model", "Global banking channel", "House prices", "Mortgage market development"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939551368", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"55655427100": {"Name": "Milcheva S.", "AuthorID": "55655427100", "AffiliationID": "60105822, 60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading, Henley Business School, Whiteknights Campus"}, "35085690900": {"Name": "Zhu B.", "AuthorID": "35085690900", "AffiliationID": "60030807", "AffiliationName": "University of Regensburg, Faculty of Economics"}}}
