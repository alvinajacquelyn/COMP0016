It has been reported in previous studies that ultrasound is able to elicit a neuro-stimulatory effect at a higher resolution than other non-invasive approaches but both the underlying mechanism that makes this possible and the practical details of how it can be implemented are still poorly understood. The current study has identified the main issues that need to be resolved in the field, proposing several different approaches to tackling these areas. An isolated in vitro peripheral nerve bundle was chosen as a simple model to demonstrate and investigate the neuro-stimulatory effect after preliminary results showed successful stimulation in a skin-nerve preparation. Early results from the nerve bundle show successful neurostimulation, indicating that structures in the peripheral nerve axon are sensitive to ultrasound. Further research using this model should reveal more precisely what structures are being affected and how to optimise the effect, helping to inform the design of future procedures and devices used in in vivo applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Higher resolution", "Nervous tissues", "Neurostimulation", "Peripheral nerves", "Research potential", "Simple modeling", "Stimulatory effects", "Ultrasonic stimulations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961329839", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57187557000": {"Name": "Wright C.J.", "AuthorID": "57187557000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603625764": {"Name": "Saffari N.", "AuthorID": "6603625764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57216069345": {"Name": "Rothwell J.", "AuthorID": "57216069345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neuroscience"}}}
