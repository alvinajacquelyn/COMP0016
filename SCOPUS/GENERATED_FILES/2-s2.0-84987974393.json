Recent experimental advances have demonstrated the utilization of single atoms on different substrates as effective catalysts, which exhibit amazing catalytic properties such as more efficient catalytic performance and higher selectivity in chemical reactions as compared to their nanostructured counterparts; however, the underlying microscopic mechanisms operative in these single atom catalysts still remain elusive. Based on first-principles calculations, herein, we present a comparative study of the key kinetic rate processes involved in CO oxidation using a monomer or dimer of two representative TMs (Pd and Ni) on defective TiO2(110) substrates (TMn@TiO2(110), n = 1, 2) to elucidate the underlying mechanism of single-atom catalysis. We reveal that the O2 activation rates of the single atom TM catalysts deposited on TiO2(110) are governed cooperatively by the classic spin-selection rule and the well-known frontier orbital theory (or generalized d-band picture) that emphasizes the energy gap between the frontier orbitals of the TM catalysts and O2 molecule. We further illuminate that the subsequent CO oxidation reactions proceed via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism with contrasting reaction barriers for the Pd monomer and dimer catalysts. These findings not only provide an explanation for existing observations of distinctly different catalytic activities of Pd@TiO2(110) and Pd2@TiO2(110) [Kaden et al., Science, 2009, 326, 826-829] but also shed new insights into future utilization and optimization of single-atom catalysis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987974393", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"26530525300": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "26530525300", "AffiliationID": "60089931, 60019118", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "57201917527": {"Name": "Gao Y.", "AuthorID": "57201917527", "AffiliationID": "60024266", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Technology Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory"}, "55857967700": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "55857967700", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "56957415000": {"Name": "Shi J.", "AuthorID": "56957415000", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "7401504128": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "7401504128", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "10639502200": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "10639502200", "AffiliationID": "60089931, 60019118", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Quantum Design of Functional Materials (ICQD), Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at the Microscale, Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7403534475": {"Name": "Cho J.", "AuthorID": "7403534475", "AffiliationID": "60024872", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Research, Institute for Natural Sciences, Hanyang University"}}}
