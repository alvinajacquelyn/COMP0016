Through complexation with a doubly-charged bisimidazolium guest we were able to detect, distinguish and quantify the presence of each CB[n]-(OH)x (where 1 \u2264 x \u2264 2n) derivative for the first time. The impact of oxidation on each CB[n] (n = 6-8) was studied individually, as well as in the presence of other competing CB[n] species. We were able to understand the reactivity of the parent CB[n] alongside its hydroxylated derivatives, CB[n]-(OH)x, and show that the oxidation of CB[n] through a free-radical approach cannot result in stoichiometric hydroxylation despite previous literature reports by Bardelang, Ouari and co-workers, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2015, 137, 10238. Furthermore, an in-depth study on hydroxylation of CB[7] was conducted. Through DFT calculations we were able to show that the second hydroxy substituent is preferentially located on the same glycoluril unit. Moreover, through optimisation of the reaction conditions we were able to access a protocol for controlled oxidation to yield a chemically monofunctional CB[7] derivative.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Controlled oxidations", "Cucurbit[n]uril", "Cucurbit[n]urils", "DFT calculation", "Functionalisation", "In-depth study", "Monofunctional", "Reaction conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010674331", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57193086661": {"Name": "McCune J.", "AuthorID": "57193086661", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry"}, "6507768052": {"Name": "Scherman O.", "AuthorID": "6507768052", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry"}, "8556311000": {"Name": "Rosta E.", "AuthorID": "8556311000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Chemistry"}}}
