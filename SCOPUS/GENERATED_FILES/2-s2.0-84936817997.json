This is achieved through subversion of the I\u03baB kinase (IKK) complex (or signalosome), which involves a physical interaction between vFLIP and the modulatory subunit IKK\u03b3. Although this interaction has been examined both in vivo and in vitro, the mechanism by which vFLIP activates the kinase remains to be determined. Because IKK\u03b3 functions as a scaffold, recruiting both vFLIP and the IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 subunits, it has been proposed that binding of vFLIP could trigger a structural rearrangement in IKK\u03b3 conducive to activation. To investigate this hypothesis we engineered a series of mutants along the length of the IKK\u03b3 molecule that could be individually modified with nitroxide spin labels. Subsequent distance measurements using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that IKK\u03b3 is a parallel coiledcoil whose response to binding of vFLIP or IKK\u03b2 is localized twisting/stiffening and not large-scale rearrangements. The coiled-coil comprises N- and C-terminal regions with distinct registers accommodated by a twist: this structural motif is exploited by vFLIP, allowing it to bind and subsequently activate the NF-\u03baB pathway. In vivo assays confirm that NF-\u03baB activation by vFLIP only requires the N-terminal region up to the transition between the registers, which is located directly C-terminal of the vFLIP binding site.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy", "Modulatory subunits", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Nitroxide spin labels", "Physical interactions", "Scale rearrangements", "Solution structures", "Structural rearrangement", "Amino Acid Motifs", "Binding Sites", "Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy", "Herpesvirus 8, Human", "Humans", "I-kappa B Kinase", "Protein Binding", "Sarcoma, Kaposi", "Viral Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936817997", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"8404736800": {"Name": "Bagn\u00e9ris C.", "AuthorID": "8404736800", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University of London"}, "55924942000": {"Name": "Rogala K.B.", "AuthorID": "55924942000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}, "55370608300": {"Name": "Zamfir V.", "AuthorID": "55370608300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Darwin Building, University College London"}, "7202538434": {"Name": "Barrett T.E.", "AuthorID": "7202538434", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Biological Sciences, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University of London"}, "54179382300": {"Name": "Kunze M.B.A.", "AuthorID": "54179382300", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology and NMR Laboratory, Dept. of Biology, University of Copenhagen"}, "56716308200": {"Name": "Dagless S.", "AuthorID": "56716308200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Darwin Building, University College London"}, "6603423331": {"Name": "Pirker K.F.", "AuthorID": "6603423331", "AffiliationID": "60024895", "AffiliationName": "Div. of Biochemistry, Dept. of Chemistry, BOKU - University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences"}, "7202827051": {"Name": "Kay C.W.M.", "AuthorID": "7202827051", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "43261125600": {"Name": "Baratchian M.", "AuthorID": "43261125600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148, 60000365", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, UCL Cancer Institute, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "26643231400": {"Name": "Collins M.K.", "AuthorID": "26643231400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148, 60000365", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, UCL Cancer Institute, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}, "9739378300": {"Name": "Hall B.A.", "AuthorID": "9739378300", "AffiliationID": "60120019, 60031668, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cancer Unit, Hutchison/MRC Research Centre, University of Cambridge"}}}
