Our argument is that \"abstraction\" is a third term that challenges the customary divorce between these domains in sociology inasmuch as interrogates their complex mediation in social life. To do so, we explore the possibilities of a sociology of abstraction as an exercise of thinking and observation aimed at: (i) comprehending the immersion of social theory's practices of abstraction as immanent to the dynamics of abstraction of society; and (ii) deciphering the concrete movement of concepts that give form to society and durability to social relations. Thus, we intend to show that the project of a sociology of abstractions consists in an unavoidable reflexive retreat that displays concepts in order to reach what is beyond concepts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abstraction", "Concepts", "Society", "Sociology", "Theoretical practice"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021821930", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"36720315300": {"Name": "Cordero R.", "AuthorID": "36720315300", "AffiliationID": "60013592", "AffiliationName": "Escuela de Sociolog\u00eda, Universidad Diego Portales"}, "57193110905": {"Name": "Salinas F.", "AuthorID": "57193110905", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
