All rights reserved.Realistic simulation of image formation in optical coherence tomography, based on Maxwell\u2019s equations, has recently been demonstrated for sample volumes of practical significance. Yet, there remains a limitation whereby reducing the size of cells used to construct a computational grid, thus allowing for more realistic representation of scatterer microstructure, necessarily reduces the overall sample size that can be modelled. This is a significant problem since, as is well known, the microstructure of a scatterer significantly influences its scattering properties. Here we demonstrate that optimized scatterer design can overcome this problem resulting in good agreement between simulated and experimental images for a structured phantom. This approach to OCT image simulation allows for image formation for biological tissues to be simulated with unprecedented realism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological tissues", "Computational grids", "OCT images", "Realistic simulation", "Sample sizes", "Sample volume", "Scattering property"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049370779", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56594958900": {"Name": "Ossowski P.", "AuthorID": "56594958900", "AffiliationID": "60021858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Informatics, Nicolaus Copernicus University"}, "35188735600": {"Name": "Curatolo A.", "AuthorID": "35188735600", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical, Electronic & Computer Engineering, The University of Western Australia"}, "7103073866": {"Name": "Sampson D.", "AuthorID": "7103073866", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "Optical + Biomedical Engineering Laboratory, School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, The University of Western Australia"}, "7102012051": {"Name": "Munro P.", "AuthorID": "7102012051", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical, Electronic & Computer Engineering, The University of Western Australia"}}}
