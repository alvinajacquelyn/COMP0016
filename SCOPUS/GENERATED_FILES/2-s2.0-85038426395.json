Consequently, NK cells do not develop in mice with targeted \u03b3c deletion. Herein we identify an alternative pathway of NK-cell development driven by the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12, which can occur independently of \u03b3c-signalling. In response to viral infection or upon exogenous administration, IL-12 is sufficient to elicit the emergence of a population of CD122+CD49b+ cells by targeting NK-cell precursors (NKPs) in the bone marrow (BM). We confirm the NK-cell identity of these cells by transcriptome-wide analyses and their ability to eliminate tumour cells. Rather than using the conventional pathway of NK-cell development, IL-12-driven CD122+CD49b+ cells remain confined to a NK1.1lowNKp46low stage, but differentiate into NK1.1+NKp46+ cells in the presence of \u03b3c-cytokines. Our data reveal an IL-12-driven hard-wired pathway of emergency NK-cell lymphopoiesis bypassing steady-state \u03b3c-signalling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cytokines", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit", "Interleukin-12", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Lymphopoiesis", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Signal Transduction", "Vaccinia", "Vaccinia virus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038426395", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55070659800": {"Name": "Ohs I.", "AuthorID": "55070659800", "AffiliationID": "60016399, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Research, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich"}, "56146341500": {"Name": "Nussbaum K.", "AuthorID": "56146341500", "AffiliationID": "60016399, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Research, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich"}, "9247432000": {"Name": "Tugues S.", "AuthorID": "9247432000", "AffiliationID": "60016399, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Research, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich"}, "7004635497": {"Name": "Becher B.", "AuthorID": "7004635497", "AffiliationID": "60016399, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Inflammation Research, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich"}, "7005936491": {"Name": "van den Broek M.", "AuthorID": "7005936491", "AffiliationID": "60016399, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Tumor Immunology, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich"}, "57202558813": {"Name": "M\u00fcnz C.", "AuthorID": "57202558813", "AffiliationID": "60016399, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Viral Immunobiology, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich"}, "14038775700": {"Name": "Arnold S.J.", "AuthorID": "14038775700", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "BIOSS Centre of Biological Signalling Studies, Albert-Ludwigs-University"}, "12762916100": {"Name": "Quezada S.A.", "AuthorID": "12762916100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Immunology Unit, Research Department of Hematology, University College London Cancer Institute"}}}
