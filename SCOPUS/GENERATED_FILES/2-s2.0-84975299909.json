To understand the interactions between these oscillators, we independently altered their excitability in spontaneously breathing vagotomized urethane- anesthetized adult rats. Hyperpolarizing preB\u00f6tC neurons decreased inspiratory activity and initiated active expiration, ultimately progressing to apnea, i.e., cessation of both inspiration and active expiration. Depolarizing pFL neurons produced active expiration at rest, but not when inspiratory activity was suppressed by hyperpolarizing preB\u00f6tC neurons. We conclude that in anesthetized adult rats active expiration is driven by the pFL but requires an additional form of network excitation, i.e., ongoing rhythmic preB\u00f6tC activity sufficient to drive inspiratory motor output or increased chemosensory drive. The organization of this coupled oscillator system, which is essential for life, may have implications for other neural networks that contain multiple rhythm/ pattern generators.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Clocks", "Exhalation", "Inhalation", "Neurons", "Rats", "Respiratory Center"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975299909", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"33367769500": {"Name": "Huckstepp R.", "AuthorID": "33367769500", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "56489757300": {"Name": "Henderson L.", "AuthorID": "56489757300", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "56491137500": {"Name": "Cardoza K.", "AuthorID": "56491137500", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "7402823901": {"Name": "Feldman J.", "AuthorID": "7402823901", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles"}}}
