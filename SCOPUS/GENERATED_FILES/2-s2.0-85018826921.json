In this paper we briefly summarise a project that focused on designing a decision support intervention to assist with the recognition, assessment and management of pain in patients with dementia in an acute hospital setting. We reflect on our experience of using the MRC framework to guide our study design, and highlight the importance of considering decision support interventions as complex interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical decision support systems", "dementia", "pain management", "pain measurement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Decision Support Systems, Clinical", "Dementia", "Humans", "Pain", "Pain Management", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018826921", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"6701760976": {"Name": "Dowding D.", "AuthorID": "6701760976", "AffiliationID": "60092672", "AffiliationName": "Visiting Nurse Service of New York"}, "24177232300": {"Name": "Lichtner V.", "AuthorID": "24177232300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}, "7004222922": {"Name": "Jos\u00e9 Closs S.", "AuthorID": "7004222922", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}}}
