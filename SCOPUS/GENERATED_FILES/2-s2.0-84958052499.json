This article outlines the problems and issues associated with the measurement of such putative dynamic risk factors (see Ward, 2015 [Dynamic risk factors: Scientific kinds or predictive constructs. Psychology, Crime and Law.], 22(1\u20132), 2\u201316], this volume for a critique of current conceptions of these), and suggests ways of ensuring that measurement is conducted in the most appropriate way for the population being dealt with. Specifically, we would note that the evidence suggests that psychometric analysis, and structured professional judgment can be used to measure dynamic psychological problems using some tools within some samples. However, their use can be hindered by a number of conceptual factors including how the tests are designed and used, their reliability and validity, the context in which they are used, and the samples used. Finally, we would note that interviews are also an important part in the process of dynamic assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conceptual issues", "Dynamic risk factors", "measurement", "psychometrics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958052499", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"7004753810": {"Name": "Beech A.", "AuthorID": "7004753810", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Forensic and Criminological Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "14046380400": {"Name": "Wakeling H.", "AuthorID": "14046380400", "AffiliationID": "60112292", "AffiliationName": "Commissioning Strategies Group, National Offender Management Service"}, "55199258700": {"Name": "Szumski F.", "AuthorID": "55199258700", "AffiliationID": "60014168", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, Adam Mickiewicz University"}, "57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
