We present findings from comprehensive, systematic literature reviews, and new analyses of published and unpublished data, to establish the effect of stillbirth on parents, families, health-care providers, and societies worldwide. Data for direct costs of this event are sparse but suggest that a stillbirth needs more resources than a livebirth, both in the perinatal period and in additional surveillance during subsequent pregnancies. Indirect and intangible costs of stillbirth are extensive and are usually met by families alone. This issue is particularly onerous for those with few resources. Negative effects, particularly on parental mental health, might be moderated by empathic attitudes of care providers and tailored interventions. The value of the baby, as well as the associated costs for parents, families, care providers, communities, and society, should be considered to prevent stillbirths and reduce associated morbidity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Costs and Cost Analysis", "Family Health", "Female", "Financial Support", "Grief", "Health Care Costs", "Health Expenditures", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Income", "Parents", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Care", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Social Security", "Social Support", "Stereotyping", "Stillbirth", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959572256", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8728758800": {"Name": "Heazell A.E.P.", "AuthorID": "8728758800", "AffiliationID": "60114461", "AffiliationName": "International Stillbirth Alliance"}, "12040807900": {"Name": "Siassakos D.", "AuthorID": "12040807900", "AffiliationID": "60016447", "AffiliationName": "Southmead Hospital"}, "55459699300": {"Name": "Flenady V.", "AuthorID": "55459699300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland"}, "8276839400": {"Name": "Gold K.J.", "AuthorID": "8276839400", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, University of Michigan"}, "56694160900": {"Name": "Storey C.", "AuthorID": "56694160900", "AffiliationID": "60114461", "AffiliationName": "International Stillbirth Alliance"}, "57218407151": {"Name": "Wojcieszek A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218407151", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Mater Research Institute, University of Queensland"}, "53983657700": {"Name": "Burden C.", "AuthorID": "53983657700", "AffiliationID": "60016447", "AffiliationName": "Southmead Hospital"}, "24400934700": {"Name": "Blencowe H.", "AuthorID": "24400934700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Maternal Reproductive and Child Health, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "24342648300": {"Name": "Bhutta Z.A.", "AuthorID": "24342648300", "AffiliationID": "60052016", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence in Women and Child Health, Aga Khan University"}, "55644705500": {"Name": "Das J.", "AuthorID": "55644705500", "AffiliationID": "60052016", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence in Women and Child Health, Aga Khan University"}, "24773525900": {"Name": "Rizvi A.", "AuthorID": "24773525900", "AffiliationID": "60052016", "AffiliationName": "Center of Excellence in Women and Child Health, Aga Khan University"}, "23090299200": {"Name": "Cacciatore J.", "AuthorID": "23090299200", "AffiliationID": "60003892", "AffiliationName": "Arizona State University"}, "57072857000": {"Name": "Dang N.", "AuthorID": "57072857000", "AffiliationID": "113841268", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Reproductive and Family Health, Hanoi Vinmec International General Hospital"}, "57073918800": {"Name": "Mensah O.K.", "AuthorID": "57073918800", "AffiliationID": "116271928", "AffiliationName": "Krachi Midwifery Training School"}, "23100303400": {"Name": "Millum J.", "AuthorID": "23100303400", "AffiliationID": "60028170, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Center Department of Bioethics, Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health"}, "56396917100": {"Name": "Nuzum D.", "AuthorID": "56396917100", "AffiliationID": "60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Cork, Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "7003834302": {"Name": "O'Donoghue K.", "AuthorID": "7003834302", "AffiliationID": "60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College Cork, Cork University Maternity Hospital"}, "7004294461": {"Name": "Redshaw M.", "AuthorID": "7004294461", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford"}, "55606369800": {"Name": "Roberts T.", "AuthorID": "55606369800", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Unit, School of Health and Population Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57151491500": {"Name": "Saraki H.E.T.", "AuthorID": "57151491500", "AffiliationID": "116272532", "AffiliationName": "Wellbeing Foundation Africa"}, "7003783438": {"Name": "Downe S.", "AuthorID": "7003783438", "AffiliationID": "60031259", "AffiliationName": "ReaCH Group, University of Central Lancashire"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
