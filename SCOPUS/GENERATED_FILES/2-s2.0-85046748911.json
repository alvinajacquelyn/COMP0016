A uniform ultra-violet background has been ruled out at those redshifts, but it is unclear whether any proposed models produce sufficient inhomogeneities. In this paper we provide an update on the measurement which first highlighted the issue: Lyman-\u03b1 effective optical depth along high-z quasar lines of sight. We nearly triple on the previous sample size in such a study thanks to the cooperation of the DES-VHS, SHELLQs, and SDSS collaborations as well as new reductions and spectra. We find that a uniform UVB model is ruled out at 5.1 < z < 5.3, as well as higher redshifts, which is perplexing. We provide the first such measurements at z \u223c 6. None of the numerical models we confronted to this data could reproduce the observed scatter.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmology: observations", "large-scale structure of universe", "quasars: absorption lines"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046748911", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56801633200": {"Name": "Bosman S.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56801633200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Cosmology, University of Cambridge"}, "56537699500": {"Name": "Reed S.", "AuthorID": "56537699500", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55861983800": {"Name": "Rorai A.", "AuthorID": "55861983800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Cosmology, University of Cambridge"}, "7403393837": {"Name": "Fan X.", "AuthorID": "7403393837", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University"}, "14058258000": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "14058258000", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University"}, "26642613600": {"Name": "Matsuoka Y.", "AuthorID": "26642613600", "AffiliationID": "60029701", "AffiliationName": "National Astronomical Observatory of Japan"}, "9436115400": {"Name": "Becker G.", "AuthorID": "9436115400", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Riverside"}}}
