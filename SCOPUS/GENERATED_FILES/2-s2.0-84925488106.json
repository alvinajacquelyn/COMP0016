The results revealed that a single vacancy defect is easy to migrate to the GF edge. The interaction between an SV and a five-numbered ring at the edge results in two neighboring five-membered rings finally, while the interaction between an SV and a seven-membered ring defect at the edge of the GF leads to a five-numbered ring and a neighbor seven-numbered ring. Our findings shed light upon understanding of the growth process of the graphene grain boundary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["First-principles study", "Graphene", "Migration", "Single vacancy defect"], "IndexKeywords": ["First-principles study", "Five-membered rings", "Graphene fragments", "Graphene growth", "Migration", "Seven-membered rings", "Single vacancies", "Single vacancy defects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925488106", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55264630000": {"Name": "Du H.B.", "AuthorID": "55264630000", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "7401504128": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "7401504128", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "56472195100": {"Name": "Sun Q.", "AuthorID": "56472195100", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Joint Research Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.X.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
