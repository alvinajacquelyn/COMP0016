Published by Oxford University Press.Capturing the dynamism that pervades biological systems requires a computational approach that can accommodate both the continuous features of the system environment as well as the flexible and heterogeneous nature of component interactions. This presents a serious challenge for the more traditional mathematical approaches that assume component homogeneity to relate system observables using mathematical equations.While the homogeneity condition does not lead to loss of accuracy while simulating various continua, it fails to offer detailed solutions when applied to systems with dynamically interacting heterogeneous components. As the functionality and architecture of most biological systems is a product of multi-faceted individual interactions at the sub-system level, continuum models rarely offer much beyond qualitative similarity. Agent-based modelling is a class of algorithmic computational approaches that rely on interactions betweenTuring-complete finite-state machines\u00e7or agents\u00e7to simulate, from the bottom-up, macroscopic properties of a system. In recognizing the heterogeneity condition, they offer suitable ontologies to the system components being modelled, thereby succeeding where their continuum counterparts tend to struggle. Furthermore, being inherently hierarchical, they are quite amenable to coupling with other computational paradigms. The integration of any agent-based framework with continuum models is arguably the most elegant and precise way of representing biological systems. Although in its nascence, agent-based modelling has been utilized to model biological complexity across a broad range of biological scales (from cells to societies). In this article, we explore the reasons that make agent-based modelling the most precise approach to model biological systems that tend to be non-linear and complex.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based model", "Biological complexity", "Cell", "Computational modeling", "Emergence", "Hybrid models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational Biology", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926441447", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"55635298800": {"Name": "Kaul H.", "AuthorID": "55635298800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
