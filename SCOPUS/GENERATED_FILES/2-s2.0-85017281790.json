The simulations utilise the latest understanding of wave propagation physics, kinematic earthquake rupture descriptions and the three-dimensional nature of the Earth's crust in the South Island of New Zealand. The effect of hypocentre location is explicitly examined, which is found to lead to significant differences in ground motion intensities (quantified in the form of peak ground velocity, PGV) over the northern half and southwest of the South Island. Comparison with previously adopted empirical ground motion models also illustrates that the simulations, which explicitly model rupture directivity and basin-generated surface waves, lead to notably larger PGV amplitudes than the empirical predictions in the northern half of the South Island and Canterbury. The simulations performed in this paper have been adopted, as one possible ground motion prediction, in the \u2018Project AF8\u2019 Civil Defence Emergency Management exercise scenario. The similarity of the modelled ground motion features with those observed in recent worldwide earthquakes as well as similar simulations in other regions, and the notably higher simulated amplitudes than those from empirical predictions, may warrant a re-examination of regional impact assessments for major Alpine Fault earthquakes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpine Fault", "basin-generated surface waves", "directivity", "emergency management", "ground motion simulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017281790", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"22956770000": {"Name": "Bradley B.A.", "AuthorID": "22956770000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Stanford University"}, "57193863048": {"Name": "Lee R.L.", "AuthorID": "57193863048", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Natural Resources Engineering, University of Canterbury"}, "57193866829": {"Name": "Thomson E.M.", "AuthorID": "57193866829", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Natural Resources Engineering, University of Canterbury"}, "54880564900": {"Name": "Tarbali K.", "AuthorID": "54880564900", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Natural Resources Engineering, University of Canterbury"}, "57216242561": {"Name": "Bae S.E.", "AuthorID": "57216242561", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "QuakeCoRE, University of Canterbury"}, "57193872115": {"Name": "Polak V.", "AuthorID": "57193872115", "AffiliationID": "60020585", "AffiliationName": "QuakeCoRE, University of Canterbury"}}}
