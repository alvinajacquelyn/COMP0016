A number of studies motivated by the costly signaling theory within evolutionary psychology have reported that priming inductions (such as looking at pictures of attractive opposite sex members) designed to trigger mating motives increase males' stated willingness to purchase conspicuous consumption items and to engage in risk-taking behaviors, and reduce loss aversion. However, a meta-analysis of this literature reveals strong evidence of either publication bias or p-hacking (or both). We then report 8 studies with a total sample of over 1,600 participants which sought to reproduce these effects. None of the studies, including one that was fully preregistered, was successful. The results question the claim that romantic primes can influence risk-taking and other potentially harmful behaviors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consumer behavior", "Decision making", "Meta-analysis", "Priming", "Risk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Choice Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Repetition Priming", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk-Taking", "Sexual Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946781488", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"7005569087": {"Name": "Shanks D.R.", "AuthorID": "7005569087", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "6602776139": {"Name": "Vadillo M.A.", "AuthorID": "6602776139", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "56954611900": {"Name": "Riedel B.", "AuthorID": "56954611900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56955502800": {"Name": "Clymo A.", "AuthorID": "56955502800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56954743200": {"Name": "Govind S.", "AuthorID": "56954743200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56955508800": {"Name": "Hickin N.", "AuthorID": "56955508800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56955827100": {"Name": "Tamman A.J.F.", "AuthorID": "56955827100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56955551700": {"Name": "Puhlmann L.M.C.", "AuthorID": "56955551700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
