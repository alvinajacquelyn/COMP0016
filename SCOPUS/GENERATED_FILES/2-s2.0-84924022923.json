Evidence about \"what is likely to happen\" should shape clinical practice", "Year": 2015, "Source": "BMC Med.", "Volume": "13", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 87, "DOI": "10.1186/s12916-014-0265-4", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84924022923&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 Croft et al.Background: Diagnosis is the traditional basis for decision-making in clinical practice. Evidence is often lacking about future benefits and harms of these decisions for patients diagnosed with and without disease. We propose that a model of clinical practice focused on patient prognosis and predicting the likelihood of future outcomes may be more useful. Discussion: Disease diagnosis can provide crucial information for clinical decisions that influence outcome in serious acute illness. However, the central role of diagnosis in clinical practice is challenged by evidence that it does not always benefit patients and that factors other than disease are important in determining patient outcome. The concept of disease as a dichotomous 'yes' or 'no' is challenged by the frequent use of diagnostic indicators with continuous distributions, such as blood sugar, which are better understood as contributing information about the probability of a patient's future outcome. Moreover, many illnesses, such as chronic fatigue, cannot usefully be labelled from a disease-diagnosis perspective. In such cases, a prognostic model provides an alternative framework for clinical practice that extends beyond disease and diagnosis and incorporates a wide range of information to predict future patient outcomes and to guide decisions to improve them. Such information embraces non-disease factors and genetic and other biomarkers which influence outcome. Summary: Patient prognosis can provide the framework for modern clinical practice to integrate information from the expanding biological, social, and clinical database for more effective and efficient care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical decision-making", "Contested diagnoses", "Diagnosis", "Evidence-based medicine", "Information", "Outcomes of care", "Overdiagnosis", "Prognosis", "Stratified medicine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making", "Diagnosis", "Diagnostic Errors", "Humans", "Professional Practice", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924022923", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"16746161700": {"Name": "Croft P.", "AuthorID": "16746161700", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "7102057417": {"Name": "Dunn K.M.", "AuthorID": "7102057417", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "6701412350": {"Name": "Peat G.", "AuthorID": "6701412350", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "7201915531": {"Name": "Riley R.D.", "AuthorID": "7201915531", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Population Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7003393647": {"Name": "Van Der Windt D.A.", "AuthorID": "7003393647", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "7201380947": {"Name": "Altman D.G.", "AuthorID": "7201380947", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Botnar Research Centre"}, "7006087510": {"Name": "Deeks J.J.", "AuthorID": "7006087510", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Population Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7201696810": {"Name": "Hay A.D.", "AuthorID": "7201696810", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7004642497": {"Name": "Hemingway H.", "AuthorID": "7004642497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, London, UCL Institute of Health Informatics"}, "7003521557": {"Name": "LeResche L.", "AuthorID": "7003521557", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "School of Dentistry Office of Research, University of Washington"}, "14631128400": {"Name": "Perel P.", "AuthorID": "14631128400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Population Health Faculty, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7202322087": {"Name": "Roberts I.", "AuthorID": "7202322087", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Population Health Faculty, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35430477200": {"Name": "Petersen S.E.", "AuthorID": "35430477200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit at Barts, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55669000100": {"Name": "Sharpe M.", "AuthorID": "55669000100", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Psychological Medicine Research, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "35499658200": {"Name": "Stevens R.J.", "AuthorID": "35499658200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "35378626600": {"Name": "Von Korff M.", "AuthorID": "35378626600", "AffiliationID": "60015998, 60104417", "AffiliationName": "Group Health Research Institute, Group Health Cooperative"}, "7006508725": {"Name": "Timmis A.", "AuthorID": "7006508725", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit at Barts, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
