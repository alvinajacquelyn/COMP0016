Hypomethylation of KvDMR1 on the maternal allele is the most common genetic cause, and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HH) is the most common biochemical abnormality. We evaluated the correlation between severity of HH and degree of hypomethylation in BWS. Out of the 19 patients with BWS due to KvDMR1 hypomethylation, 10 patients had no HH, 5 had mild transient HH that resolved spontaneously, and 4 required diazoxide therapy for up to 6 months. There was no correlation between the degree of KvDMR1 hypomethylation and severity of HH in the 6 patients studied. All patients also showed marked clinical heterogeneity with respect to the features of BWS. In patients with BWS due to hypomethylation of KvDMR1, the clinical presentation of HH is quite heterogeneous with no correlation with the degree of KvDMR1 hypomethylation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome", "hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia", "hypomethylation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Congenital Hyperinsulinism", "DNA Methylation", "Follow-Up Studies", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Heterogeneity", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Phenotype", "Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920064807", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"24342425800": {"Name": "Senniappan S.", "AuthorID": "24342425800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics, Institute of Child Health"}, "14052307300": {"Name": "Ismail D.", "AuthorID": "14052307300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507189640": {"Name": "Shipster C.", "AuthorID": "6507189640", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26643177200": {"Name": "Hussain K.", "AuthorID": "26643177200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics, Institute of Child Health"}, "6603671274": {"Name": "Beesley C.", "AuthorID": "6603671274", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Regional Genetics Laboratories, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
