The control of a CSTR is very challenging due to its nonlinear dynamics and the presence of external disturbances. In this paper, a novel discrete time sliding mode control method for the CSTR is presented. Then a disturbance observer is designed to eliminate the effect of external disturbances on the CSTR system. Stability analysis is presented based on the Lyapunov method. Finally, the control performance of the proposed method is validated by using MATLAB simulation experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Continuous stirred tank reactor", "Discrete time sliding mode control", "Disturbance observer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous stirred tank reactor", "Control performance", "Discrete time sliding mode control", "Disturbance observer", "External disturbances", "Matlab simulations", "Process industries", "Stability analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054069305", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57196187402": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "57196187402", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "China University of Petroleum, College of Chemical Engineering"}, "23112052400": {"Name": "Zhao D.", "AuthorID": "23112052400", "AffiliationID": "60105111", "AffiliationName": "China University of Petroleum, College of Chemical Engineering"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
