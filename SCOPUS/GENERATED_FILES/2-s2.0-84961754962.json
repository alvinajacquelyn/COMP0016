These include long-QT syndrome (LQTS), Short-QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS) and Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT). The cardiomyopathies represent the other major group of inherited cardiac conditions associated with SCD, of which hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common. Exercise is a known trigger of ventricular arrhythmias in many of these conditions, however marked genetic and clinical heterogeneity within individual diseases means that certain patients are at a much greater risk of lethal ventricular arrhythmias during exercise than others. For instance, LQTS type 1 (LQT1) and CPVT patients are at particular risk during exertion, whilst in patients with other genetic variants of LQTS, BrS and SQTS, alternative triggers are more significant precipitants. Many channelopathy (principally Brugada, CPVT) & cardiomyopathy (mainly HCM) patients receive primary or secondary prevention therapy with an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). Exercising with an ICD in situ carries a range of additional risks including inappropriate shocks and lead complications. This review will focus on the risk of exercise-induced SCD in patients with inherited cardiac conditions, the current clinical guidelines in this area and the special consideration of patients with an ICD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia", "Brugada syndrome", "Cardiomyopathy", "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia", "Exercise", "Hypertrophic", "Long QT syndrome", "Sudden cardiac death"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brugada Syndrome", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Exercise", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Practice Guidelines as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961754962", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57188575219": {"Name": "Hammond-Haley M.", "AuthorID": "57188575219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "23985899500": {"Name": "Patel R.S.", "AuthorID": "23985899500", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Bart's Heart Centre, Bart's Health NHS Trust"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Bart's Heart Centre, Bart's Health NHS Trust"}, "15769947600": {"Name": "Provid\u00eancia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Bart's Heart Centre, Bart's Health NHS Trust"}}}
