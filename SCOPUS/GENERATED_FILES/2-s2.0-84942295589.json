Real images of the projector lenses formed at the viewer's eyes produce exit pupils that follow the eye positions by the projectors moving laterally under the control of a head tracker. This provides the viewer with a comfortable degree of head movement. The retroreflecting screen, display hardware, infrared head tracker, and means of stabilizing the image position on the screen are explained. The performance of the display in terms of crosstalk, resolution, image distortion, and other parameters is described. Finally, applications of this display type are suggested. A glasses-free 3D for a single user is described that uses a simple system of a picoprojector pair and a retroflecting screen where the projectors move in accordance with the viewer's head position with the use of a stepper motor controlled by a head tracker. The performance of the display in terms of crosstalk, resolution, image distortion and other parameters is described. Finally, potential applications for the display are suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autostereoscopic", "exit pupils", "head tracking", "infrared", "picoprojector", "retroreflector"], "IndexKeywords": ["Auto stereoscopic", "Exit pupil", "Head tracking", "Pico projectors", "Retro reflector"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942295589", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"9132350600": {"Name": "Surman P.", "AuthorID": "9132350600", "AffiliationID": "60005510", "AffiliationName": "Nanyang Technological University"}, "7203059023": {"Name": "Day S.", "AuthorID": "7203059023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "56672286400": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "56672286400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "56120975200": {"Name": "Benjamin J.", "AuthorID": "56120975200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "6603674502": {"Name": "Urey H.", "AuthorID": "6603674502", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Ko\u00e7 University, Department of Electrical Engineering"}, "35773118400": {"Name": "Aksit K.", "AuthorID": "35773118400", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Ko\u00e7 University, Department of Electrical Engineering"}}}
