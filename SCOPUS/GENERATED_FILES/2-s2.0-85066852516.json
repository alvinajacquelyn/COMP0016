Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Psychological SocietyObjectives: This paper aimed to explore client experiences of the therapeutic relationship among adolescents with good outcomes after receiving Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for moderate to severe depression. Design: This was a qualitative study employing Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Methods: As part of a randomized clinical trial, 77 adolescents with moderate to severe depression were interviewed using a semi-structured interview, which was audio-recorded. Five of these interviews, with adolescents aged 14\u201318 years who completed CBT and had good outcomes, were purposively sampled and analysed using IPA. Results: The findings indicated that a positive therapeutic relationship was fostered with therapists who respected the adolescents\u2019 autonomy and sense of individuality, while offering experiences of emotional closeness and connection. This was achieved by balancing the dual roles of being \u2018friendly\u2019 and affable, with being a \u2018professional expert\u2019 thereby embodying a collaborative and egalitarian approach. Conclusions: The therapeutic relationship in CBT can help to motivate adolescents to engage with cognitively and emotionally challenging tasks. By providing an understanding of what helps and hinders the development of a positive therapeutic relationship, the current findings offer important insight into how therapists can foster positive relationships with depressed adolescents. This knowledge will make it more likely that adolescents will engage in the treatment process and in turn experience greater therapeutic gains. Practitioner points: Offers a detailed phenomenological analysis of what fostered a positive therapeutic relationship in good outcome CBT, and what was experienced as harmful from the adolescents\u2019 perspective. Provides support that the therapeutic relationship is crucial in CBT; a respectful and understanding relationship provides a platform for the adolescent to carry out CBT activities and tasks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescent", "cognitive-behavioural therapy", "depression", "IMPACT-My Experience", "therapeutic relationship"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066852516", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57045955500": {"Name": "Wilmots E.", "AuthorID": "57045955500", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL and the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "55782616400": {"Name": "Thackeray L.", "AuthorID": "55782616400", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL and the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "57216973595": {"Name": "Midgley N.", "AuthorID": "57216973595", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Child Attachment and Psychological Therapies Research Unit (ChAPTRe), UCL and the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families"}, "7201868784": {"Name": "Reynolds S.", "AuthorID": "7201868784", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Charlie Waller Institute, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "36343766500": {"Name": "Loades M.", "AuthorID": "36343766500", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}}}
