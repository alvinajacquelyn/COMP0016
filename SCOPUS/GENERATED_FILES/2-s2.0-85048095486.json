Method: Between 2012 and 2017, 371 children with suspected acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) seen in three tertiary centres were tested for MOG-Ab and AQP4-Ab. Medical notes were retrospectively reviewed, and clinical and demographic data compiled. Clinical phenotyping was performed blinded to the antibody results. Results: After review, 237 of the 371 were diagnosed with ADS. Of these, 76 out of 237 (32.1%) were MOG-Ab positive and 14 out of 237 (5.9%) were AQP4-Ab positive. None were positive for both autoantibodies. All 134 patients with non-ADS were negative for MOG-Ab. MOG-Ab were identified in 45 out of 70 (64.3%) patients presenting with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and in 24 out of 25 patients with relapsing ADEM. Thirty-six out of 75 (48%) MOG-Ab positive patients relapsed. Of the 33 children with neuromyelitis optic spectrum disorder, 14 were AQP4-Ab positive, 13 were MOG-Ab positive, and 6 were seronegative. Of the children with longitudinal samples, 8 out of 13 AQP4-Ab remained positive during the disease course compared to 35 out of 43 MOG-Ab (13/16 monophasic and 22/27 relapsing). Interpretation: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies were identified in a third of children with ADS. Almost half of the MOG-Ab positive children relapsed and the majority of them remained antibody positive over 4-years follow-up. What this paper adds: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG-Ab) are highly specific for acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS). Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies are not identified in children with peripheral demyelination or genetic leukodystrophies/hypomyelination. Up to 48% of MOG-Ab ADS paediatric patients relapse, higher than previously thought. Seroconversion to MOG-Ab negative status is infrequent; patients may test MOG-Ab positive at follow-up sampling even when asymptomatic. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies status should only be used in conjunction with the clinical information to guide maintenance therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antibodies", "Aquaporin 4", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Demyelinating Diseases", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Myelin-Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein", "Retrospective Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048095486", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57207487289": {"Name": "Duignan S.", "AuthorID": "57207487289", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "35388344100": {"Name": "Hemingway C.", "AuthorID": "35388344100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "14631844100": {"Name": "Hacohen Y.", "AuthorID": "14631844100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroinflammation, Queen Square MS Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55473089200": {"Name": "Wright S.", "AuthorID": "55473089200", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "6603875837": {"Name": "Wassmer E.", "AuthorID": "6603875837", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "37116003100": {"Name": "Rossor T.", "AuthorID": "37116003100", "AffiliationID": "60117215, 60107269, 60109217, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Children's Neurosciences, Evelina London Children's Hospital at Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King's Health Partners Academic Health Science Centre"}, "8762850900": {"Name": "Lim M.", "AuthorID": "8762850900", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, Kings College"}, "6506214846": {"Name": "Cazabon J.", "AuthorID": "6506214846", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Department, King's College Hospital"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Immunology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), University College London Hospitals (UCLH), Biomedical Research Centre (BRC)"}}}
