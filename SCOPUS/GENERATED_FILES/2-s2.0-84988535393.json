Growing evidence suggests that sensory neurons can optimally encode natural stimuli by ensuring that their tuning opposes stimulus statistics, such that the resulting neuronal response contains equal power at all frequencies (i.e., is \u201cwhite\u201d). Such temporal decorrelation or whitening has been observed across modalities, but the effects of neural heterogeneities on determining tuning and thus responses to natural stimuli have not been investigated. Here, we investigate how heterogeneities in sensory pyramidal neurons organized in three parallel maps representing the body surface determine responses to second-order electrosensory stimulus features in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. While some sources of heterogeneities such as ON- and OFF-type responses to first-order did not affect responses to second-order electrosensory stimulus features, other sources of heterogeneity within and across the maps strongly determined responses. We found that these cells effectively performed a fractional differentiation operation on their input with exponents ranging from zero (no differentiation) to 0.4 (strong differentiation). Varying adaptation in a simple model explained these heterogeneities and predicted a strong correlation between fractional differentiation and adaptation. Using natural stimuli, we found that only a small fraction of neurons implemented temporal whitening. Rather, a large fraction of neurons did not perform any significant whitening and thus preserved natural input statistics in their responses. We propose that this information is needed to properly decode optimized information sent in parallel through temporally whitened responses based on context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Electrosensory", "Envelope", "Neural coding", "SK channels", "Weakly electric fish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Adaptation, Physiological", "Analysis of Variance", "Animals", "Electric Fish", "Electric Organ", "Electric Stimulation", "Female", "Male", "Models, Neurological", "Neural Pathways", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Sensory Receptor Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988535393", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57189597704": {"Name": "Huang C.", "AuthorID": "57189597704", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, McGill University"}, "6701543076": {"Name": "Chacron M.", "AuthorID": "6701543076", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, McGill University"}}}
