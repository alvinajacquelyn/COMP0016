This project aimed to investigate the relationship between national progress towards deinstitutionalization and (1) quality of longer-term mental health care (2) service users\u2019 ratings of that care in nine European countries. Methods Quality of care was assessed in 193 longer-term hospital- and community-based facilities in Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain and the UK. Data on users\u2019 ratings of care were collected from 1579 users of these services. Country level variables were compiled from publicly available data. Multilevel models were fit to assess associations with quality of care and service user experiences of care. Results Significant positive associations were found between deinstitutionalization and (1) five of seven quality of care domains; and (2) service user autonomy. A 10% increase in expenditure was associated with projected clinically important improvements in quality of care. Conclusions Greater deinstitutionalization of mental health mental health services is associated with higher quality of care and better service user autonomy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Psychiatry in Europe", "Quality of care", "Social and cross-cultural psychiatry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Community Mental Health Services", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Deinstitutionalization", "Europe", "Female", "Germany", "Greece", "Humans", "Italy", "Long-Term Care", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mental Health", "Mental Health Services", "Netherlands", "Poland", "Quality of Life", "Spain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016418120", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57188648072": {"Name": "Taylor Salisbury T.", "AuthorID": "57188648072", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6602601081": {"Name": "Killaspy H.", "AuthorID": "6602601081", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56591241100": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "56591241100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
