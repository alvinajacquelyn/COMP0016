Due to sophisticated interference scenarios between threads, reasoning about such programs is challenging and error-prone, and can benefit from mechanization. In this paper, we present the first completely formalized framework for mechanized verification of full functional correctness of fine-grained concurrent programs. Our tool is based on the recently proposed program logic FCSL. It is implemented as an embedded domain-specific language in the dependently-typed language of the Coq proof assistant, and is powerful enough to reason about programming features such as higher-order functions and local thread spawning. By incorporating a uniform concurrency model, based on state-transition systems and partial commutative monoids, FCSL makes it possible to build proofs about concurrent libraries in a thread-local, compositional way, thus facilitating scalability and reuse: libraries are verified just once, and their specifications are used ubiquitously in client-side reasoning. We illustrate the proof layout in FCSL by example, and report on our experience of using FCSL to verify a number of concurrent programs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compositional program verification", "Concurrency", "Dependent types", "Mechanized proofs", "Separation logic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concurrency", "Dependent types", "Mechanized proofs", "Program Verification", "Separation logic"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951799368", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"35114020100": {"Name": "Sergey I.", "AuthorID": "35114020100", "AffiliationID": "60121727", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Software Institute"}, "15047125400": {"Name": "Nanevski A.", "AuthorID": "15047125400", "AffiliationID": "60121727", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Software Institute"}, "8558971000": {"Name": "Banerjee A.", "AuthorID": "8558971000", "AffiliationID": "60121727", "AffiliationName": "IMDEA Software Institute"}}}
