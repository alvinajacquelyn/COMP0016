We develop the rationale that some of the knowledge synthesis resulting from these trials, particularly with regard to the claimed noninferiority of percutaneous coronary intervention beyond nondiabetic patients with low anatomic complexity, may have been affected by trial design, patient selection based on suitability for percutaneous coronary intervention, and end point optimization favoring percutaneous coronary intervention over coronary artery bypass grafting. We provide recommendations that include holding a circumspect interpretation of the currently available evidence, as well as suggestions for the collaborative design and conduct of future clinical trials in this and other fields.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical trials as topic", "Coronary artery disease", "Coronary stenosis", "Percutaneous coronary intervention", "Surgical procedures, operative", "Treatment outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bias", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Coronary Artery Bypass", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Humans", "Myocardial Revascularization", "Patient Selection", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058903625", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"7005761464": {"Name": "Ruel M.", "AuthorID": "7005761464", "AffiliationID": "60011635, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "University of Ottawa Heart Institute, University of Ottawa"}, "6602288806": {"Name": "Glineur D.", "AuthorID": "6602288806", "AffiliationID": "60011635, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "University of Ottawa Heart Institute, University of Ottawa"}, "26867592300": {"Name": "Falk V.", "AuthorID": "26867592300", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60009113", "AffiliationName": "German Heart Center, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "6701811527": {"Name": "Farkouh M.E.", "AuthorID": "6701811527", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60112419, 60084072", "AffiliationName": "Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, Heart and Stroke Richard Lewar Centre, University of Toronto"}, "57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}, "7005592319": {"Name": "Gaudino M.F.", "AuthorID": "7005592319", "AffiliationID": "60018043, 60007997", "AffiliationName": "New York Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medicine"}, "7402888851": {"Name": "Cameron D.E.", "AuthorID": "7402888851", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7102253640": {"Name": "Taggart D.P.", "AuthorID": "7102253640", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospitals"}}}
