Methods Patient-specific brain tissue models (n = 7) with bilateral DBS electrodes in the GPi were set up using the finite element method in five patients who had undergone stereotactic proton-density MRI-guided surgery and showed variable improvement with DBS. Simulations (n = 27) of the electric field were performed and the results visualized on the respective preoperative stereotactic MRI scans. The mean electric field volumes (n = 81) within the 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 V/mm isosurfaces were calculated and compared with the anatomy. Results Visualization of the simulated electric field confirmed that the anteromedial limbic GPi was the main stimulated target for four of the patients and the posteromedial sensorimotor GPi for one. Larger volumes extended asymmetrically, with parts of fields stretching into the lamina between GPi and globus pallidus externus and into the internal capsule. There was a high correlation (r = 0.994, n = 54) between volumes and brain sides, but with a systematic shift toward the right side, especially for the larger volumes. Simulations with homogeneous tissue models showed no differences. Conclusions Patient-specific DBS electric field simulations in the GPi as visualized on proton-density MR scans can be implemented in patients with GTS. Visualization of electric fields together with stereotactic thin-slice MRI can provide further support when predicting anatomical structures possibly influenced by DBS in this complex disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "electric field simulation", "globus pallidus internus", "modeling and simulation", "Tourette syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Computer Simulation", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Female", "Globus Pallidus", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Neurological", "Tourette Syndrome", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923605433", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"55885912900": {"Name": "W\u00e5rdell K.", "AuthorID": "55885912900", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "54383126100": {"Name": "Diczfalusy E.", "AuthorID": "54383126100", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "55422448400": {"Name": "Andersson M.", "AuthorID": "55422448400", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "13807490000": {"Name": "\u00c5str\u00f6m M.", "AuthorID": "13807490000", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "22985114000": {"Name": "Kefalopoulou Z.", "AuthorID": "22985114000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
