However, oxygen tension monitored by the peripheral (arterial) chemoreceptors is not sensitive to regional CNS differences in partial pressure of oxygen (PO<inf>2</inf>) that reflect variable levels of neuronal activity or local tissue hypoxia, pointing to the necessity of a functional brain oxygen sensor. This experimental animal (rats and mice) study shows that astrocytes, the most numerous brain glial cells, are sensitive to physiological changes in PO<inf>2</inf>. Astrocytes respond to decreases in PO<inf>2</inf>a few millimeters of mercury below normal brain oxygenation with elevations in intracellular calcium ([Ca 2<sup>+</sup>]i). The hypoxia sensor of astrocytes resides in the mitochondria in which oxygen is consumed. Physiological decrease in PO<inf>2</inf>inhibits astroglial mitochondrial respiration, leading to mitochondrial depolarization, production of free radicals, lipid peroxidation, activation of phospholipase C, IP3 receptors, and release of Ca 2<sup>+</sup>from the intracellular stores. Hypoxia-induced [Ca 2<sup>+</sup>]i increases in astrocytes trigger fusion of vesicular compartments containing ATP. Blockade of astrocytic signaling by overexpression of ATP-degrading enzymes or targeted astrocytespecific expression of tetanus toxin light chain (to interfere with vesicular release mechanisms) within the brainstem respiratory rhythmgenerating circuits reveals the fundamental physiological role of astroglial oxygen sensitivity; in low-oxygen conditions (environmental hypoxia), this mechanism increases breathing activity even in the absence of peripheral chemoreceptor oxygen sensing. These results demonstrate that astrocytes are functionally specialized CNS oxygen sensors tuned for rapid detection of physiological changes in brain oxygenation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrocyte", "Glia", "Hypoxia", "Oxygen", "Respiration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cells, Cultured", "Chemoreceptor Cells", "Immunohistochemistry", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Oxygen", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Respiratory Physiological Phenomena"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937700323", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56081167500": {"Name": "Angelova P.", "AuthorID": "56081167500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "15044599900": {"Name": "Kasymov V.", "AuthorID": "15044599900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,Physiology,and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "24437921600": {"Name": "Christie I.", "AuthorID": "24437921600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,Physiology,and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "56732816800": {"Name": "Sheikhbahaei S.", "AuthorID": "56732816800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,Physiology,and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "35754175500": {"Name": "Turovsky E.", "AuthorID": "35754175500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,Physiology,and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "13004689900": {"Name": "Marina N.", "AuthorID": "13004689900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,Physiology,and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7004432175": {"Name": "Korsak A.", "AuthorID": "7004432175", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,Physiology,and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "8768192800": {"Name": "Ackland G.", "AuthorID": "8768192800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,Physiology,and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience,Physiology,and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "35338475800": {"Name": "Zwicker J.", "AuthorID": "35338475800", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Centre for Neuroscience and Women and Children\u2019s Health Research Institute, University of Alberta"}, "7102117115": {"Name": "Funk G.", "AuthorID": "7102117115", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Centre for Neuroscience and Women and Children\u2019s Health Research Institute, University of Alberta"}, "6701598833": {"Name": "Teschemacher A.", "AuthorID": "6701598833", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}, "56353446000": {"Name": "Kasparov S.", "AuthorID": "56353446000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}}}
