We develop two fully discrete schemes based on the piecewise linear Galerkin finite element method in space and convolution quadrature in time with the generating function given by the backward Euler method/second-order backward difference method, and establish error estimates optimal with respect to the regularity of problem data. These two schemes are first- and second-order accurate in time for both smooth and nonsmooth data. Extensive numerical experiments for two-dimensional problems confirm the convergence analysis and robustness of the schemes with respect to data regularity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Convolution quadrature", "Diffusion wave", "Error estimate", "Finite element method", "Fractional diffusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Backward difference method", "Caputo fractional derivatives", "Diffusion wave equation", "Diffusion waves", "Error estimates", "Fractional diffusion", "Galerkin finite element methods", "Two-dimensional problem"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960093749", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003806023": {"Name": "Lazarov R.", "AuthorID": "7003806023", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas AandM University"}, "55649851300": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "55649851300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics, Columbia University"}}}
