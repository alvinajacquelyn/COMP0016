We sought to identify systematically tested interventions and strategies to improve recruitment. The review identified 13 papers. The following four themes emerged: trial availability/regulatory factors; service configuration/place-of-care factors; recruitment methods and developmental factors specific to young people. We could not identify any studies that had employed prospective interventions to improve recruitment. Without available research studies in which to garner data on adolescents and young adults, we will always be constrained in our ability to provide evidence based care with resultant limitations on our ability to improve outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "clinical trial", "recruitment", "research", "young adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Life Style", "Neoplasms", "Patient Selection", "Psychology, Adolescent", "Research Design", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050411397", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"23979721800": {"Name": "Fern L.A.", "AuthorID": "23979721800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202910374": {"Name": "Taylor R.M.", "AuthorID": "57202910374", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
