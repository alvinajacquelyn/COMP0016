The Authors.A variety of physical mechanisms are jointly responsible for facilitating air-sea gas transfer through turbulent processes at the atmosphere-ocean interface. The nature and relative importance of these mechanisms evolves with increasing wind speed. Theoretical and modeling approaches are advancing, but the limited quantity of observational data at high wind speeds hinders the assessment of these efforts. The HiWinGS project successfully measured gas transfer coefficients (k660) with coincident wave statistics under conditions with hourly mean wind speeds up to 24 m s\u22121 and significant wave heights to 8 m. Measurements of k660 for carbon dioxide (CO2) and dimethylsulfide (DMS) show an increasing trend with respect to 10 m neutral wind speed (U10 N), following a power law relationship of the form: (Formula presented.) and (Formula presented.). Among seven high wind speed events, CO2 transfer responded to the intensity of wave breaking, which depended on both wind speed and sea state in a complex manner, with (Formula presented.) increasing as the wind sea approaches full development. A similar response is not observed for DMS. These results confirm the importance of breaking waves and bubble injection mechanisms in facilitating CO2 transfer. A modified version of the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment Gas transfer algorithm (COAREG ver. 3.5), incorporating a sea state-dependent calculation of bubble-mediated transfer, successfully reproduces the mean trend in observed k660 with wind speed for both gases. Significant suppression of gas transfer by large waves was not observed during HiWinGS, in contrast to results from two prior field programs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["air-sea gas exchange", "carbon dioxide", "dimethylsulfide", "eddy correlation", "gas transfer model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032426899", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"7004106194": {"Name": "Blomquist B.W.", "AuthorID": "7004106194", "AffiliationID": "60027716", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Division, NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory"}, "18633507200": {"Name": "Bariteau L.", "AuthorID": "18633507200", "AffiliationID": "60027716", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Division, NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory"}, "22975069200": {"Name": "Fairall C.W.", "AuthorID": "22975069200", "AffiliationID": "60027716", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Division, NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratory"}, "57186564000": {"Name": "Brumer S.E.", "AuthorID": "57186564000", "AffiliationID": "60033011, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University"}, "6602623584": {"Name": "Zappa C.J.", "AuthorID": "6602623584", "AffiliationID": "60033011, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University"}, "7004775578": {"Name": "Huebert B.J.", "AuthorID": "7004775578", "AffiliationID": "60013791", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oceanography, University of Hawaii"}, "7005753600": {"Name": "Brooks I.M.", "AuthorID": "7005753600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "55789402500": {"Name": "Yang M.", "AuthorID": "55789402500", "AffiliationID": "60010503", "AffiliationName": "Plymouth Marine Laboratory"}, "34771905600": {"Name": "Prytherch J.", "AuthorID": "34771905600", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Meteorology, Stockholm University"}, "7202170177": {"Name": "Hare J.E.", "AuthorID": "7202170177", "AffiliationID": "60003579, 60013791", "AffiliationName": "Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research, University of Hawaii"}, "13614216200": {"Name": "Czerski H.", "AuthorID": "13614216200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57197776190": {"Name": "Matei A.", "AuthorID": "57197776190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102806701": {"Name": "Pascal R.W.", "AuthorID": "7102806701", "AffiliationID": "60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean Technology and Engineering, National Oceanography Centre"}}}
