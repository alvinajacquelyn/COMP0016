The event\u2019s premise was that liquid crystals are the ur-form that constitute and govern Modernity and its after-shocks. For sure this is because the dialectic of liquidity and crystallization, of flow and refraction, is key to the advent of screen-based media (LCD TVs, computers and mobile devices) and thus how we perceive, image and imagine the world. As such, liquid crystals as a \u2018phase of matter\u2019 are epochal. But more than this because, while the emergence of such a brave new world is manifestly contemporary and their \u2018discovery\u2019 is comparatively recent (1888), the very fact of liquid crystals goes back at least 4.5 billion years: water, for instance, is crystalline and thus our planet, our ecology and we ourselves are always already liquid crystal. Such a self-evident but under-acknowledged fact, discerned and foregrounded superbly by Esther Leslie in her recent book Liquid Crystals: The Science and Art of a Fluid Form (2016), becomes an occasion to bring together historians, theorists and practitioners of the convergences of design-science, media-ecology, political-aesthetics, and graphic-technologies. Using Leslie\u2019s book as a springboard, each of the five contributors, including Leslie herself, were invited to deliver a 10-minute presentation, an opening statement to set the scene, and raise fundamental questions to be considered further in the ensuing discussion. This structure is retained here, along with some of the informality that live conversation affords.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA", "earth minerals", "life", "liquid crystals", "media ecologies", "screen-based media", "tactile vision", "X-ray crystallography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046812455", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"55486079200": {"Name": "Candela E.", "AuthorID": "55486079200", "AffiliationID": "60104069", "AffiliationName": "School of Communication, Royal College of Art"}, "57207540880": {"Name": "Cubitt S.", "AuthorID": "57207540880", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "School of Media and Communications, Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "35519334400": {"Name": "Dicker B.", "AuthorID": "35519334400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of French, King\u2019s College London"}, "56954603800": {"Name": "Drew B.", "AuthorID": "56954603800", "AffiliationID": "60084283", "AffiliationName": "Slade School of Fine Art, UCL"}, "55619574000": {"Name": "Leslie E.", "AuthorID": "55619574000", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of English and Humanities, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
