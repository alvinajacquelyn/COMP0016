This approach, however, may introduce error if the role of thrombus in assisting the wall in bearing the pulse pressure loading is neglected. Our aim was to introduce a methodology for evaluating and potentially correcting this error in estimating distensibility. Electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography images of eleven patients were obtained, and the volume change between diastole and systole was measured. Using finite element procedures, we determined the equivalent pulse pressure loading that should be applied to the wall of a model where thrombus was digitally removed, to yield the same sac volumetric increase caused by applying the luminal pulse pressure to the model with thrombus. The equivalent instead of the measured pulse pressure was used in the distensibility expression. For a relative volumetric thrombus deposition (VILT) of 50 %, a 62 % distensibility underestimation resulted when thrombus role was neglected. A strong linear correlation was observed between distensibility underestimation and VILT. To assess the potential value of noninvasive wall distensibility measurement in rupture risk stratification, the role of thrombus on wall loading should be further investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["4D CT", "Arterial stiffness", "Rupture risk", "Vascular biomechanics", "Young\u2019s modulus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdominal aortic aneurysms", "Arterial stiffness", "Computed tomography images", "Finite element procedure", "Intraluminal thrombus", "Rupture risk", "Thrombus deposition", "Vascular biomechanics", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aorta, Abdominal", "Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Blood Pressure", "Elastic Modulus", "Female", "Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Thrombosis", "Vascular Stiffness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925486193", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"15122950300": {"Name": "Metaxa E.", "AuthorID": "15122950300", "AffiliationID": "60019181", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Research and Technology\u2013Hellas, Institute of Applied and Computational Mathematics"}, "16744583100": {"Name": "Tzirakis K.", "AuthorID": "16744583100", "AffiliationID": "60019181", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Research and Technology\u2013Hellas, Institute of Applied and Computational Mathematics"}, "6506470668": {"Name": "Papaharilaou Y.", "AuthorID": "6506470668", "AffiliationID": "60019181", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Research and Technology\u2013Hellas, Institute of Applied and Computational Mathematics"}, "43861482000": {"Name": "Kontopodis N.", "AuthorID": "43861482000", "AffiliationID": "60012413, 60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Medical School, University of Crete"}, "6602728753": {"Name": "Ioannou C.", "AuthorID": "6602728753", "AffiliationID": "60012413, 60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Vascular Surgery, Medical School, University of Crete"}, "6504821984": {"Name": "Vavourakis V.", "AuthorID": "6504821984", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
