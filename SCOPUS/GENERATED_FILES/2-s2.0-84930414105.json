Terrestrial life\u2019s preference for one isomer over its mirror image in D-sugars and L-amino acids has both fascinated and puzzled biochemists for over a century. But the contrasting case of the equally fundamental phospholipids has received less attention. Although the phospholipid glycerol headgroups of archaea and bacteria are both exclusively homochiral, the stereochemistries between the two domains are opposite. Here I argue that the reason for this \u201cdual homochirality\u201d was a simple evolutionary choice at the independent origin of the two synthesizing enzymes. More broadly, this points to a trivial biogenic cause for the evolution of homochirality: the enzymatic processes that produce chiral biomolecules are stereospecific in nature. Once an orientation has been favored, shifting to the opposite is both difficult and unnecessary. Homochirality is thus the simplest and most parsimonious evolutionary case.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaea", "Bacteria", "Catalysis", "Dual homochirality", "Lipid divide", "Origins", "Stereospecificity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Archaea", "Bacteria", "Evolution, Chemical", "Origin of Life", "Phospholipids", "Stereoisomerism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930414105", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57091567800": {"Name": "Sojo V.", "AuthorID": "57091567800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
