However, repairs at telomeres can lead to genomic instability, often associated with cancer. While most rapidly dividing cells employ telomerase, the others maintain telomere length through HR-dependent alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathways. Here we describe the crystal structures of Holliday junction intermediates of the HR-dependent ALT mechanism. Using an extended human telomeric repeat, we also report the crystal structure of two Holliday junctions in close proximity, which associate together through strand exchange to form a hemicatenated double Holliday junction. Our combined structural results demonstrate that ACC nucleotides in the C-rich lagging strand (5\u2032-CTAACCCTAA-3\u2032) at the telomere repeat sequence constitute a conserved structural feature that constrains crossover geometry and is a preferred site for Holliday junction formation in telomeres.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Close proximity", "Genomic instability", "Holliday junction intermediates", "Holliday junctions", "Homologous recombination", "Human telomeric DNA", "Repeat sequences", "Structural feature", "Crystallization", "DNA", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Telomere"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056232780", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57196221455": {"Name": "Haider S.", "AuthorID": "57196221455", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57204571758": {"Name": "Li P.", "AuthorID": "57204571758", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57194329253": {"Name": "Khiali S.", "AuthorID": "57194329253", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7102183504": {"Name": "Parkinson G.N.", "AuthorID": "7102183504", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "23670788000": {"Name": "Munnur D.", "AuthorID": "23670788000", "AffiliationID": "60013801, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford"}, "57204334274": {"Name": "Ramanathan A.", "AuthorID": "57204334274", "AffiliationID": "60024266", "AffiliationName": "Computational Science and Engineering Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory"}}}
