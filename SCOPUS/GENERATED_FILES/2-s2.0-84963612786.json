Due to the well-known limits of dynamic analysis, we may only compute an under-approximation of the true observation-based slice. However, because the observation-based slice captures all possible dependence that can be observed, even such approximations can yield insight into the limitations of static slicing. For example, a static slice, S, that is strictly smaller than the corresponding observation based slice is potentially unsafe. We present the results of three sets of experiments on 12 different programs, including benchmarks and larger programs, which investigate the relationship between static and observation-based slicing. We show that, in extreme cases, observation-based slices can find the true minimal static slice, where static techniques cannot. For more typical cases, our results illustrate the potential for observation-based slicing to highlight limitations in static slicers. Finally, we report on the sensitivity of observation-based slicing to test quality.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Language independents", "Static slicing", "Static techniques", "Test quality", "Under-approximation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963612786", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"7101905317": {"Name": "Binkley D.", "AuthorID": "7101905317", "AffiliationID": "60014693", "AffiliationName": "Loyola University Maryland"}, "7004798617": {"Name": "Gold N.", "AuthorID": "7004798617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006379048": {"Name": "Harman M.", "AuthorID": "7006379048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603760534": {"Name": "Krinke J.", "AuthorID": "6603760534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55845758800": {"Name": "Islam S.", "AuthorID": "55845758800", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "University of East London"}, "20435019400": {"Name": "Yoo S.", "AuthorID": "20435019400", "AffiliationID": "60032144", "AffiliationName": "KAIST"}}}
