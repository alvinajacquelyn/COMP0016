In particular way, radiation from the \"water window\" spectral range, which extends between K-absorption edges of carbon and oxygen (280\u00f7540 eV), could be used in order to obtain high-contrast biological imaging. Laser-plasma double stream gas puff target source is suitable for SXR microscopy in the \"water window\" spectral range, which recently allowed to develop a system, operating at He-like nitrogen spectral line \u03bb=2.88 nm, which permits to obtain images with half-pitch spatial resolution of \u223c 60 nm, exposure time as low as a few seconds and represents an important alternative for high resolution imaging for biomedical applications, material science and nanotechnology using a very compact laser source. The goal of measurements, presented herein, is to show SXR images of various biological samples, proving high contrast in the \"water window\" and characterize in more detail such compact microscopy system, based on a laser plasma source with a double stream gas puff target and a Fresnel zone plate (FZP) objective. The influence of various acquisition parameters on the quality of the obtained SXR images, expressed in terms of a signal-to-noise (SNR) will be demonstrated. Moreover, because the measurements are performed on SXR images, similar measurements might be performed as a benchmark in order to characterize different imaging systems as well.", "AuthorKeywords": ["\"water-window\"", "Fresnel zone plates", "Gas puff target source", "Imaging", "Optics.", "Signal-to-noise ratio", "Soft X-ray microscopy", "SXR radiation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition parameters", "Biomedical applications", "Extreme ultraviolets", "Fresnel zone plate", "Gas puff targets", "High-resolution imaging", "Soft x-ray microscopy", "Water window"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949032571", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56519604100": {"Name": "Torrisi A.", "AuthorID": "56519604100", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "15045938800": {"Name": "Wachulak P.", "AuthorID": "15045938800", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "7003336293": {"Name": "Bartnik A.", "AuthorID": "7003336293", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "6701721634": {"Name": "Kostecki J.", "AuthorID": "6701721634", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "55579284700": {"Name": "Wegrzynski L.", "AuthorID": "55579284700", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "6602827310": {"Name": "Jarocki R.", "AuthorID": "6602827310", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "6701728762": {"Name": "Szczurek M.", "AuthorID": "6701728762", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "7004495078": {"Name": "Fiedorowicz H.", "AuthorID": "7004495078", "AffiliationID": "60008056", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology"}, "55943345600": {"Name": "Nawaz F.", "AuthorID": "55943345600", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech Technical University"}}}
