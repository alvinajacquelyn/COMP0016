It explored the impact of classes on parents\u2019 relations with the school and their children, and their ability to support their children\u2019s literacy development. The study involved 27 school-based programmes for pupils aged between five and seven, and their parents. It used mixed methods, which involved surveys of 118 parents and 20 family literacy tutors, telephone interviews with a sub-sample of 28 parents, analysis of teaching plans and observations of classes. Findings showed that parents wanted to learn the ways the school was teaching their child to read and write, and by demystifying school literacy pedagogies and processes the programmes developed greater connectivity between home and the school, and parents felt more able to support their children\u2019s literacy development at home.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Family literacy", "home\u2013school relations", "motivations", "parents", "pedagogy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046021188", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"7102441749": {"Name": "Swain J.", "AuthorID": "7102441749", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education (IOE)"}, "35740025900": {"Name": "Cara O.", "AuthorID": "35740025900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education (IOE)"}}}
