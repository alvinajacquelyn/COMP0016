Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75% of all bladder cancer cases. Transurethral resection and intravesical treatments remain the main treatment modality. Up to 31-78% of cases recur, hence the need for intensive treatment and surveillance protocols which makes bladder cancer one of the most expensive cancers to manage. The purpose of this review is to compare contemporary guidelines from Europe, (European Association of Urology), the United States (National Comprehensive Cancer Network), the United Kingdom (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), Japan (Japanese Urological Association) and the International Consultation on Bladder Cancer (ICUD). We compare and contrast the different guidelines and the evidence on which their recommendations are based.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bladder cancer", "Consensus guidelines", "Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer", "Recommendations", "Review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Medical Oncology", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969884789", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57201942956": {"Name": "Tan W.S.", "AuthorID": "57201942956", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "54794458100": {"Name": "Rodney S.", "AuthorID": "54794458100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "30467833700": {"Name": "Lamb B.", "AuthorID": "30467833700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "12793936300": {"Name": "Feneley M.", "AuthorID": "12793936300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}}}
