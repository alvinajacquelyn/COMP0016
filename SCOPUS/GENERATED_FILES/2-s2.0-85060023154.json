The objectives of this study were to assess the feasibility of radical prostatectomy after vascular targeted photodynamic therapy and describe functional and oncologic outcomes.Materials and Methods:We retrospectively included in study 45 patients who underwent salvage radical prostatectomy after vascular targeted photodynamic therapy for recurrent prostate cancer at a total of 14 surgical centers in Europe between October 2008 and March 2017. Of the 42 radical prostatectomies performed 16 were robot-assisted, 6 were laparoscopic and 20 were open surgery. Primary end points were morbidity and technical difficulties. Secondary end points were early and intermediate postoperative functional and oncologic outcomes.Results:Median operative time was 180 minutes (IQR 150-223). Median blood loss was 200 ml (IQR 155-363). According to the surgeons the surgery was easy in 29 patients (69%) and difficult in 13 (31%). Nerve sparing was feasible in 14 patients (33%). Five postoperative complications (12%) were found, including 2 Clavien I, 2 Clavien II and 1 Clavien IIIB complications. Of the cases 13 (31%) were pT3 and 21 (50%) were pT2c. Surgical margins were positive in 13 patients (31%). Prostate specific antigen was undetectable at 6 to 12 months in 37 patients (88%). Nine patients underwent complementary radiotherapy. Four patients had final prostate specific antigen greater than 0.2 ng/ml at a median followup of 23 months (IQR 12-36). At 1 year 27 patients (64%) were completely continent (no pads) and 10 (24%) had low incontinence (1 pad). Four patients (11%) recovered potency without treatment and 23 (64%) recovered potency with appropriate treatment.Conclusions:Salvage radical prostatectomy after vascular targeted photodynamic therapy treatment was feasible and safe without difficulty for most of the surgeons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["palladium-bacteriopheophorbide", "photochemotherapy", "prostatectomy", "prostatic neoplasms", "salvage therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Bacteriochlorophylls", "Feasibility Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Photochemotherapy", "Photosensitizing Agents", "Postoperative Complications", "Prostate", "Prostatectomy", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Retrospective Studies", "Salvage Therapy", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060023154", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56108165500": {"Name": "Pierrard V.", "AuthorID": "56108165500", "AffiliationID": "60001780", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Lyon Sud University Hospital"}, "37000376300": {"Name": "Terrier J.E.", "AuthorID": "37000376300", "AffiliationID": "60001780", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Lyon Sud University Hospital"}, "6603777800": {"Name": "Ruffion A.", "AuthorID": "6603777800", "AffiliationID": "60001780", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Lyon Sud University Hospital"}, "55799261200": {"Name": "Giai J.", "AuthorID": "55799261200", "AffiliationID": "60001780", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Lyon Sud University Hospital"}, "35170378300": {"Name": "Lebdai S.", "AuthorID": "35170378300", "AffiliationID": "60009445", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Urology, Angers University Hospital"}, "14323136200": {"Name": "Azzouzi A.R.", "AuthorID": "14323136200", "AffiliationID": "60009445", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Urology, Angers University Hospital"}, "57196148719": {"Name": "Fortier E.", "AuthorID": "57196148719", "AffiliationID": "60009445", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Urology, Angers University Hospital"}, "8678893500": {"Name": "Kleinclauss F.", "AuthorID": "8678893500", "AffiliationID": "123352485", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Center"}, "25947708500": {"Name": "Potiron E.", "AuthorID": "25947708500", "AffiliationID": "123352581", "AffiliationName": "Atlantis Clinic"}, "7101848305": {"Name": "Rigaud J.", "AuthorID": "7101848305", "AffiliationID": "60028048", "AffiliationName": "Nantes University Hospital"}, "55911115000": {"Name": "Vincendeau S.", "AuthorID": "55911115000", "AffiliationID": "60028893", "AffiliationName": "Rennes University Hospital"}, "7005694427": {"Name": "Villers A.", "AuthorID": "7005694427", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "Lille University Hospital"}, "17345727800": {"Name": "Gaston R.", "AuthorID": "17345727800", "AffiliationID": "112673346", "AffiliationName": "Saint Augustin Clinic"}, "55653299900": {"Name": "Saussine C.", "AuthorID": "55653299900", "AffiliationID": "60011024", "AffiliationName": "Strasbourg University Hospital"}, "35310170100": {"Name": "Gaillac B.", "AuthorID": "35310170100", "AffiliationID": "115071899", "AffiliationName": "STEBA France"}, "6602792294": {"Name": "Joniau S.", "AuthorID": "6602792294", "AffiliationID": "121976928", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Center"}, "7004230990": {"Name": "Van Der Poel H.", "AuthorID": "7004230990", "AffiliationID": "60070177", "AffiliationName": "Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"}, "22635516900": {"Name": "Salomon G.", "AuthorID": "22635516900", "AffiliationID": "121977056", "AffiliationName": "Spire Portsmouth Hospital"}, "7006115526": {"Name": "Rassweiler J.", "AuthorID": "7006115526", "AffiliationID": "60011309", "AffiliationName": "SLK Kliniken"}, "57206198035": {"Name": "Casanova J.", "AuthorID": "57206198035", "AffiliationID": "121977512", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Center"}, "6603966723": {"Name": "Medina-Lopez R.A.", "AuthorID": "6603966723", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Virgen Del Roc\u00edo University Hospital"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
