These three expansions constitute of the foundations of the fast multipole algorithm (FMA). The plane-wave expansion has the low-frequency breakdown issue due to its failure in capturing the evanescent spectra, while the multipole expansion is inefficient at high frequencies. The spectral representation usually involves in direction-dependent issue. In this communication, the 2-D FMA is interpreted as Parseval's theorem in Fourier transform. To achieve a stable and accurate transition between the multipole expansion and the plane-wave expansion, a novel diagonalization in the 2-D FMA is proposed with scaled special functions based on a discrete Fourier transform. A wideband fast algorithm with high accuracies can be achieved efficiently.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)", "multipole expansion", "Parseval's theorem", "plane-wave expansion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Exponential expansion", "Fast multipole algorithm", "Low-frequency breakdown", "Multipole expansions", "Plane-wave expansions", "Spectral representations", "Two Dimensional (2 D)", "Two-dimensional displays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054247989", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55821462800": {"Name": "Meng L.", "AuthorID": "55821462800", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois of Urbana-Champaign"}, "55928724700": {"Name": "Hidayeto\u01e7lu M.", "AuthorID": "55928724700", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois of Urbana-Champaign"}, "56440896700": {"Name": "Xia T.", "AuthorID": "56440896700", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois of Urbana-Champaign"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "56353178500": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "56353178500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "26643168800": {"Name": "Chew W.", "AuthorID": "26643168800", "AffiliationID": "60009254", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University"}}}
