It is unknown how the presence and persistence of PEs during early adulthood affects cognition and brain function. The current study assessed working memory as well as brain function and structure in 149 individuals, with and without PEs, drawn from a population cohort. Observer-rated PEswere classified as persistent or transient on the basis of longitudinal assessments.Working memorywas assessed using the n-back task during fMRI. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to characterize frontoparietal network configuration and voxel-based morphometry was utilized to examine gray matter. Those with persistent, but not transient, PEs performed worse on the n-back task, compared with controls, yet showed no significant differences in regional brain activation or brain structure. DCM analyses revealed greater emphasis on frontal connectivity within a frontoparietal network in those with PEs compared with controls. We propose that these findings portray an altered configuration of working memory function in the brain, potentially indicative of an adaptive response to atypical development associated with the manifestation of PEs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALSPAC", "fMRI", "Neurodevelopment", "Psychotic experiences", "Working memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Neural Pathways", "Parietal Lobe", "Psychotic Disorders", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959325185", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55699153700": {"Name": "Fonville L.", "AuthorID": "55699153700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Box 68"}, "35822342800": {"Name": "Dutt A.", "AuthorID": "35822342800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Box 68"}, "57078237900": {"Name": "Mollon J.", "AuthorID": "57078237900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Box 68"}, "55782719300": {"Name": "Reichenberg A.", "AuthorID": "55782719300", "AffiliationID": "60012981, 60004670", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "7402606754": {"Name": "David A.S.", "AuthorID": "7402606754", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, Box 68"}, "12243251700": {"Name": "Kadosh K.C.", "AuthorID": "12243251700", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "54879358800": {"Name": "Drakesmith M.", "AuthorID": "54879358800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neuroscience, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "16935234900": {"Name": "Jones D.K.", "AuthorID": "16935234900", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neuroscience, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "6603745740": {"Name": "Zammit S.", "AuthorID": "6603745740", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
