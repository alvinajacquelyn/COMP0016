Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.High detection accuracy in piezoelectric-based force sensing in interactive displays has gained global attention. To achieve this, artificial neural networks (ANN)\u2014successful and widely used machine learning algorithms\u2014have been demonstrated to be potentially powerful tools, providing acceptable location detection accuracy of 95.2% and force level recognition of 93.3% in a previous study. While these values might be acceptable for conventional operations, e.g., opening a folder, they must be boosted for applications where intensive operations are performed. Furthermore, the relatively high computational cost reported prevents the popularity of ANN-based techniques in conventional artificial intelligence (AI) chip-free end-terminals. In this article, an ANN is designed and optimized for piezoelectric-based touch panels in interactive displays for the first time. The presented technique experimentally allows a conventional smart device to work smoothly with a high detection accuracy of above 97% for both location and force level detection with a low computational cost, thereby advancing the user experience, and serviced by piezoelectric-based touch interfaces in displays.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artificial neural network", "Detection accuracy", "Force sensing", "Interactive displays", "Piezoelectric-based touch panel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational costs", "Detection accuracy", "Force sensing", "Interactive display", "Location detection", "Three dimensional detection", "Touch interfaces", "Touch panels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061845928", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57189845828": {"Name": "Gao S.", "AuthorID": "57189845828", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University"}, "57206691429": {"Name": "Dai Y.", "AuthorID": "57206691429", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "School of Instrumentation and Optoelectronic Engineering, Beihang University"}, "56714632700": {"Name": "Qu X.", "AuthorID": "56714632700", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Big Data-Based Precision Medicine, Beihang University"}, "57193485730": {"Name": "Kitsos V.", "AuthorID": "57193485730", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic & Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "57206693042": {"Name": "Wan B.", "AuthorID": "57206693042", "AffiliationID": "122233038", "AffiliationName": "Cicada Canada Inc."}}}
