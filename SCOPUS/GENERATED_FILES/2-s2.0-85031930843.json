Evaluating every possible combination of choices is computationally intractable, particularly for longer multistep decisions. Therefore, humans frequently use heuristics to reduce the complexity of decisions. We recently used a goal-directed planning task to demonstrate the profound behavioral influence and ubiquity of one such shortcut, namely aversive pruning, a reflexive Pavlovian process that involves neglecting parts of the decision space residing beyond salient negative outcomes. However, how the brain implements this important decision heuristic and what underlies individual differences have hitherto remained unanswered. Therefore, we administered an adapted version of the same planning task to healthy male and female volunteers undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine the neural basis of aversive pruning. Through both computational and standard categorical fMRI analyses, we show that when planning was influenced by aversive pruning, the subgenual cingulate cortex was robustly recruited. This neural signature was distinct from those associated with general planning and valuation, two fundamental cognitive components elicited by our task but which are complementary to aversive pruning. Furthermore, we found that individual variation in levels of aversive pruning was associated with the responses of insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices to the receipt of large monetary losses, and also with subclinical levels of anxiety. In summary, our data reveal the neural signatures of an important reflexive Pavlovian process that shapes goal-directed evaluations and thereby determines the outcome of high-level sequential cognitive processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aversive pruning", "Decision-making", "FMRI", "Punishment", "Reward", "Subgenual cingulate cortex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Avoidance Learning", "Choice Behavior", "Conditioning, Classical", "Decision Making", "Female", "Goals", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Reaction Time", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031930843", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36098058500": {"Name": "Lally N.", "AuthorID": "36098058500", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health"}, "55236903300": {"Name": "Faulkner P.", "AuthorID": "55236903300", "AffiliationID": "60006511, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, University California, Los Angeles"}, "8501341500": {"Name": "Roiser J.P.", "AuthorID": "8501341500", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "14056255700": {"Name": "Huys Q.J.M.", "AuthorID": "14056255700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Hospital of Psychiatry, University of Zurich"}, "6507881043": {"Name": "Eshel N.", "AuthorID": "6507881043", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
