We analyzed data on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 participants with late mild cognitive impairment or AD, and we described individual trajectories of Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale\u2013Cognitive Subscale scores using a semimechanistic logistic model with a mixed effects\u2013based approach, which accounted for dropout and adjusted for baseline Mini Mental State Examination scores. The covariate model included psychosis subtypes, age, gender, education, medications, and Apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (Apo-e \u03b54 genotype). We found that the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale\u2013Cognitive Subscale rate of increase was doubled in misidentification (\u03b2r,misid_subtype = 0.63, P = 0.031) and mixed (both subtypes; \u03b2r,mixed_subtype = 0.70, P = 0.003) when compared with nonpsychotic (or paranoid) patients, suggesting that the misidentification subtype may represent a distinct AD sub-phenotype associated with an accelerated pathological process.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoproteins E", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Genotype", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Multicenter Studies as Topic", "Psychotic Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062950506", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57203554426": {"Name": "D'Antonio F.", "AuthorID": "57203554426", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7102635651": {"Name": "Reeves S.", "AuthorID": "7102635651", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "34769841900": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "34769841900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "6506571037": {"Name": "de Lena C.", "AuthorID": "6506571037", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Neuroscience, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "36467005400": {"Name": "Sheng Y.", "AuthorID": "36467005400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57190739702": {"Name": "McLachlan E.", "AuthorID": "57190739702", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "25824711800": {"Name": "Bertrand J.", "AuthorID": "25824711800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics Institute, University College London"}}}
