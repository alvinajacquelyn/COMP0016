Methods: Retinal sections from mice (healthy normal and uveitis) and postmortem human (no history of eye disease (n = 5) and uveitis (n = 7)) were stained for AnxA1 expression and imaged by immunofluorescence microscopy. AnxA1 cellular expression was determined by colabeling with CD45, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and Iba-1 cells, with additional staining of AnxA1 receptors formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) and FPRL1/FPR2. Mice with acute endotoxin-induced uveitis and chronic experimental autoimmune uveitis were treated locally by intravitreal injection with hrAnxA1, and disease was assessed by clinical scoring and quantification of leukocyte infiltrate via flow cytometry. Results: Constitutive expression of AnxA1 was observed in both healthy mouse and human retinae, and its expression increased during uveitis compared to healthy controls. AnxA1 colocalizes predominantly with CD45+ cells, GFAP+ macroglia, and to a lesser extent, Iba-1+ myeloid cells. We also demonstrate that local treatment with hrAnxA1 attenuates the severity of uveitis in mice. Conclusions: These data indicate that locally expressed AnxA1 is elevated in the retina during intraocular inflammation. We demonstrate that local administration of hrAnxA1 to augment levels results in suppression of uveitis in mice. Translational Relevance: Our data suggest that elevated expression of retinal AnxA1 in human uveitis may be immunoregulatory and that local supplementation with hrAnxA1 may provide a potential novel treatment for inflammatory eye diseases such as noninfectious uveitis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Annexin A1", "Endotoxininduced uveitis", "Experimental autoimmune uveitis", "Inflammation", "Uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032019624", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36981692900": {"Name": "Gardner P.J.", "AuthorID": "36981692900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56522353400": {"Name": "Ribeiro J.", "AuthorID": "56522353400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Academic Unit of Ophthalmology"}, "24448818000": {"Name": "Yazid S.", "AuthorID": "24448818000", "AffiliationID": "60159874", "AffiliationName": "Trio Medicines Ltd"}}}
