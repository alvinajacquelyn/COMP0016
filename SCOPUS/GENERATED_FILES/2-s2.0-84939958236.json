At these very low temperatures (<150K) ice can exist in metastable forms, but the nature of these ices remains poorly understood. In this paper we show that ice which is grown at mesospherically relevant temperatures does not have a structure corresponding to the well-known hexagonal form or the metastable cubic form. Instead, the ice which forms under mesospheric conditions is a material in which cubic and hexagonal sequences of ice are randomly arranged to produce stacking disordered ice (ice Isd). The structure of this ice is in the trigonal crystal system, rather than the cubic or hexagonal systems, and is expected to produce crystals with aspect ratios consistent with lidar observations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amorphous ice", "Amorphous solid water", "Cubic ice", "Mesospheric clouds", "Noctilucent clouds", "Stacking disordered ice"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amorphous ice", "Amorphous solid water", "Cubic ice", "Hexagonal systems", "Lidar observation", "Noctilucent clouds", "Trigonal crystals", "Very low temperatures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939958236", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"8404544300": {"Name": "Murray B.J.", "AuthorID": "8404544300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "54936465600": {"Name": "Malkin T.L.", "AuthorID": "54936465600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Climate and Atmospheric Science, School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "7004272333": {"Name": "Salzmann C.G.", "AuthorID": "7004272333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
