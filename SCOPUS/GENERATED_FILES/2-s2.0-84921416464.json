However, to date the long-term associations between diet and inflammation have been poorly described. Our aim was to assess the extent to which adherence to a healthy diet and dietary improvements over a 6-year exposure period prevented subsequent chronic inflammation over a 5-year follow-up in a large British population of men and women. METHODS: Data were drawn from 4600 adults (mean \u00b1 standard deviation, age 49.6 \u00b1 6.1 years, 28% were women) from the prospective Whitehall cohort II study. Adherence to a healthy diet was measured using Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) scores in 1991-1993 (50.7 \u00b1 11.9 points) and 1997-1999 (51.6 \u00b1 12.4 points). Chronic inflammation, defined as average levels of serum interleukin-6 from 2 measures 5 years apart, was assessed in 1997-1999 and 2002-2004. RESULTS: After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and health status, participants who maintained a high AHEI score (ie, a healthy diet, n = 1736, 37.7%) and those who improved this score over time (n = 681, 14.8%) showed significantly lower mean levels of interleukin-6 (1.84 pg/mL, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-1.98 and 1.84 pg/mL, 95% CI, 1.70-1.99, respectively) than those who had a low AHEI score (n = 1594, 34.6%) over the 6-year exposure period (2.01 pg/mL, 95% CI, 1.87-2.17). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that maintaining and improving adherence to healthy dietary recommendations may reduce the risk of long-term inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alternative Healthy Eating Index", "Diet quality indices", "Inflammatory marker", "Interleukin-6", "Middle-aged population", "Nutritional Epidemiology", "Prospective cohort"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers", "Chronic Disease", "Diet", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nutrition Policy", "Patient Compliance", "Prospective Studies", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921416464", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"15070433300": {"Name": "Akbaraly T.N.", "AuthorID": "15070433300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55045633300": {"Name": "Ferrie J.E.", "AuthorID": "55045633300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivimaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35239241500": {"Name": "Virtanen M.", "AuthorID": "35239241500", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "56678958000": {"Name": "Lowe G.", "AuthorID": "56678958000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}}}
