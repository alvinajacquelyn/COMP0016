Methods: Patients and controls were recruited from hospitals in southern Sweden as part of the prospective and longitudinal Swedish BioFinder Study. In the present study, we included 42 patients with PD and 69 controls who had clinical assessment and lumbar puncture at baseline. Baseline CSF samples were analyzed for \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), \u03b2-amyloid 1-42 (A\u03b242), tau, phosphorylated tau, and neurofilament light. Associations between CSF markers at baseline and change in clinical characteristics after 2 years of follow-up were investigated using multivariate models adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, and levodopa-equivalent daily dose. Results: Higher levels of \u03b1Syn within the PD group were associated with progression of motor symptoms and cognitive decline over 2 years, indicated by significant relationships between aSyn and change in Hoehn and Yahr (\u03b2 = 0.394,p = 0.043), Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Part III (UPDRS-III) (\u03b2 = 0.449, p = 0.013), Timed Up and Go (\u03b2 = 0.406, p = 0.023), and A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (\u03b2 = 0.423, p = 0.018). Lower levels of A\u03b242 were associated with worsening of performance on delayed memory recall (F = 5.834,p = 0.022). Finally, high levels of phosphorylated tau were associated with worsening in motor symptoms (UPDRS-III, b 5 0.350, = 5 0.045; Hoehn and Yahr, \u03b2 = 0.366, = 5 0.038). Conclusion: We found evidence of a link between higher levels of aSyn at baseline and worsening of motor symptoms and cognitive speed over 2 years in PD. Increased aSyn might be a marker of more intense synaptic degeneration in PD. The results indicate that cortical amyloid pathology (low CSF Ab42) is associated with memory decline.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "alpha-Synuclein", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Cognition Disorders", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Movement Disorders", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parkinson Disease", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Sweden", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925950008", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56823785300": {"Name": "Hall S.", "AuthorID": "56823785300", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "55416685100": {"Name": "Surova Y.", "AuthorID": "55416685100", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "36977574800": {"Name": "Lindqvist D.", "AuthorID": "36977574800", "AffiliationID": "113141716", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatry Sk\u00e5ne"}, "25224623900": {"Name": "\u00d6hrfelt A.", "AuthorID": "25224623900", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
