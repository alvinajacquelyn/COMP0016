Since then, the term NP has been expanded to accommodate a large number of novel nano-sized particles engineered from a range of materials. The great interest in NPs is likely not only a result of the two successful vaccines against hepatitis B and Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) that use this technology, but also due to the versatility of those small-sized particles, as indicated by the wide range of applications reported so far, ranging from medicinal and cosmetics to purely technical applications. In this review, we will focus on the use of NPs, especially virus-like particles (VLPs), in the field of vaccines and will discuss their employment as vaccines, antigen display platforms, adjuvants and drug delivery systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Immunogen", "Nanoparticles", "Vaccines", "Virus-like particles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016880357", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57193513675": {"Name": "Gomes A.C.", "AuthorID": "57193513675", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60175818", "AffiliationName": "The Jenner Institute, Oxford University"}, "57193510080": {"Name": "Mohsen M.", "AuthorID": "57193510080", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60175818", "AffiliationName": "The Jenner Institute, Oxford University"}, "8763194900": {"Name": "Bachmann M.F.", "AuthorID": "8763194900", "AffiliationID": "60010987", "AffiliationName": "Inselspital, Universitatsspital"}}}
