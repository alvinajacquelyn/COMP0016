We obtained eight epochs of spectroscopic follow-up and find a very different median radial velocity of -56.5 \u00b1 5.3 kms-1. If this difference were to be explained by binarity, then the unseen companion would be an intermediate-mass black hole; we therefore argue that the Gaia DR2 radial velocity must be in error. We find it likely that the spectra obtained by Gaia were dominated by the light from a star 4.3 arcsec away, and that, due to the slitless, time delay integration nature of Gaia spectroscopy, this angular offset corresponded to a spurious 620 km s-1 shift in the calcium triplet of the second star. We argue that such unanticipated alignments between stars may account for 105 of the 202 stars with radial velocities faster than 500 km s-1 in Gaia DR2 and propose a quality cut to exclude stars that are susceptible. We propose further cuts to remove stars where the colour photometry is suspect and stars where the radial velocity measurement is based on fewer than four transits, and thus produce an unprecedentedly clean selection of Gaia radial velocities for use in studies of Galactic dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["binaries: general", "stars: kinematics and dynamics."], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067946913", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190231170": {"Name": "Boubert D.", "AuthorID": "57190231170", "AffiliationID": "60031641, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Magdalen College, University of Oxford"}, "57203218749": {"Name": "Strader J.", "AuthorID": "57203218749", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University"}, "57189635710": {"Name": "Swihart S.", "AuthorID": "57189635710", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University"}, "12791083400": {"Name": "Chomiuk L.", "AuthorID": "12791083400", "AffiliationID": "60031707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University"}, "56719567900": {"Name": "Aguado D.", "AuthorID": "56719567900", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55916474900": {"Name": "Koposov S.E.", "AuthorID": "55916474900", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "57195339746": {"Name": "Sanders J.L.", "AuthorID": "57195339746", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55566835100": {"Name": "Evans N.W.", "AuthorID": "55566835100", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "15078368700": {"Name": "Seabroke G.", "AuthorID": "15078368700", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Dorking, Surrey"}}}
