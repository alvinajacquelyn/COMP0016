An accurate assessment of its discomfort would be valuable to children, their parents, and clinicians. Methods: We performed a prospective study of pediatric patients seen over 3 months at 1 center. Pain was scored for both nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography (EMG) on validated scales, depending on the child's age and in comparison with venipuncture. Results: In 100 cases the pain recorded fell within the moderate range on the scoring systems used. Sixty-six percent of patients described the pain to be equivalent or less than that with venipuncture. EMG of > 1 muscle or a proximal muscle produced more pain in patients <4 years of age. Conclusions: When discussing the test with patients, the physician should reassure the patient and parents regarding the degree of pain that may be encountered, which is not materially different from venipuncture.
