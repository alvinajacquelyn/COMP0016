We split a conventional carrierless amplitude and phase modulated signal into m subcarriers in order to protect from the attenuation experienced at high frequencies in low-pass VLC systems. We investigate the relationship between throughput/spectral efficiency and m, where m = {10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1} subcarriers over a fixed total signal bandwidth of 6.5 MHz. We show that transmission speeds (spectral efficiencies) of 31.53 (4.85), 30.88 (4.75), 25.40 (3.90), 23.65 (3.60), 15.78 (2.40), and 9.04 (1.40) Mb/s (b/s/Hz) can be achieved for the listed values of m, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bit error rate", "equalizers", "light emitting diodes", "Visible light communications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amplitude and phase modulations", "Carrier-less", "High frequency HF", "Phase modulated signals", "Signal bandwidth", "Spectral efficiencies", "Sub-carriers", "Transmission speed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928393628", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "35093759400": {"Name": "Burton A.", "AuthorID": "35093759400", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "56800923400": {"Name": "Werfli K.", "AuthorID": "56800923400", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "25123131200": {"Name": "Minh H.L.", "AuthorID": "25123131200", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "33267554200": {"Name": "Bentley E.", "AuthorID": "33267554200", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "6508134236": {"Name": "Chvojka P.", "AuthorID": "6508134236", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "23567179900": {"Name": "Popoola W.O.", "AuthorID": "23567179900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"}, "8306417100": {"Name": "Papakonstantinou I.", "AuthorID": "8306417100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University London"}}}
