Developed in tandem with the CATH database, the original FunTree contained just 276 superfamilies focused on enzymes. Here, we present an update of FunTree that has expanded to include 2340 superfamilies including both enzymes and proteins with non-enzymatic functions annotated by Gene Ontology (GO) terms. This allows the investigation of how novel functions have evolved within a structurally defined superfamily and provides a means to analyse trends across many superfamilies. This is done not only within the context of a protein's sequence and structure but also the relationships of their functions. New measures of functional similarity have been integrated, including for enzymes comparisons of overall reactions based on overall bond changes, reaction centres (the local environment atoms involved in the reaction) and the sub-structure similarities of the metabolites involved in the reaction and for non-enzymes semantic similarities based on the GO. To identify and highlight changes in function through evolution, ancestral character estimations are made and presented. All this is accessible through a new re-designed web interface that can be found at http://www.funtree.info.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Databases, Protein", "Enzymes", "Evolution, Molecular", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Proteins", "Sequence Analysis, Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976883123", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"36913138800": {"Name": "Sillitoe I.", "AuthorID": "36913138800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "12244914800": {"Name": "Furnham N.", "AuthorID": "12244914800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
