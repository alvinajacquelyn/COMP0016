The relative weight of the different manifestations has never been evaluated using both behavioural and fMRI measures, a challenge taken here to assess the major systems called into play in dyslexia by different theories. We found that adult well-compensated dyslexics were systematically impaired only in reading and in visuo-phonological tasks, while deficits for other systems (e.g., motor/cerebellar, visual magnocellular/motion perception) were only very occasional. In line with these findings, fMRI showed a reliable hypoactivation only for the task of reading, in the left occipito-temporal cortex (l-OTC). The l-OTC, normally a crossroad between the reading system and other systems, did not show the same level of intersection in dyslexics; yet, it was not totally silent because it responded, in segregated parts, during auditory phonological and visual motion perception tasks. This minimal behavioural and functional anatomical comorbidity demonstrates that a specific deficit of reading is the best description for developmental dyslexia, at least for adult well-compensated cases, with clear implications for rehabilitation strategies. The reduced intersection of multiple systems in the l-OTC suggests that dyslexics suffer from a coarser connectivity, leading to disconnection between the multiple domains that normally interact during reading.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comorbidity", "Developmental dyslexia", "Disconnection hypothesis", "fMRI", "Occipito-temporal cortex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Brain", "Dyslexia", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motion Perception", "Reading", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032667599", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"35483343400": {"Name": "Danelli L.", "AuthorID": "35483343400", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Department and Milan Centre for Neuroscience, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "7004453576": {"Name": "Paulesu E.", "AuthorID": "7004453576", "AffiliationID": "60084910", "AffiliationName": "fMRI Unit-IRCCS Galeazzi"}, "24586914900": {"Name": "Berlingeri M.", "AuthorID": "24586914900", "AffiliationID": "60032111", "AffiliationName": "DISTUM, Department of Humanistic Studies, University of Urbino Carlo Bo"}, "7003788458": {"Name": "Bottini G.", "AuthorID": "7003788458", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioural Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "7003727657": {"Name": "Borghese N.", "AuthorID": "7003727657", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "AIS-Lab and Department of Computer Science, University of Milan"}, "26655841300": {"Name": "Lucchese M.", "AuthorID": "26655841300", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "AIS-Lab and Department of Computer Science, University of Milan"}, "24069354000": {"Name": "Sberna M.", "AuthorID": "24069354000", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Department, Niguarda Ca\u2019 Granda Hospital"}, "57201873636": {"Name": "Price C.", "AuthorID": "57201873636", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}}}
