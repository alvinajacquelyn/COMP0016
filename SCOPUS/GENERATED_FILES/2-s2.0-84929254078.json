The method represents the culmination of a comprehensive program of material and large-scale testing, Finite Element Fracture Mechanics (FEFM) simulations, and reliability analysis. The primary motivation for the development of this method is to support PJP splices in seismic moment frames. Since failure of PJP splices is controlled by fracture at the unfused weld root, FEFM simulations that rely on elastic-plastic fracture mechanics (i.e., the use of the J-integral) and consider von Mises plasticity, along with large deformation response are used to parametrically examine a range of splice configurations. Results of the FEFM simulations are validated against previously published large-scale test data and are ultimately used to develop equations to characterize the strength of PJP WCS connections. Reliability analysis is used to formulate strength reduction (i.e.,\u03c6) factors such that the design method may exhibit acceptable margins of safety.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Deformation response", "Design formulae", "Elastic plastic fracture mechanics", "Large scale testing", "Large scale tests", "Partial joint penetrations", "Strength reduction", "Von-Mises plasticity"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929254078", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"56505607300": {"Name": "Stillmaker K.", "AuthorID": "56505607300", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}, "9040155900": {"Name": "Kanvinde A.", "AuthorID": "9040155900", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}, "26537243900": {"Name": "Galasso C.", "AuthorID": "26537243900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
