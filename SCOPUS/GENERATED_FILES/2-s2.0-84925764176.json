DESIGN:Descriptive study. SETTING:Database maintained by the Cochrane IPD Meta-analysis Methods Group, supplemented by records of published IPD meta-analyses held in a separate database. POPULATION: A test sample of systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials that included a meta-analysis of IPD, and a separate sample of clinical guidelines, matched to the IPD meta-analyses according to medical condition, interventions, populations, and dates of publication. DATA EXTRACTION:Descriptive information on each guideline was extracted along with evidence showing use or critical appraisal, or both, of the IPD meta-analysis within the guideline; recommendations based directly on its findings and the use of other systematic reviews in the guideline. RESULTS:Based on 33 IPD meta-analyses and 177 eligible, matched clinical guidelines there was evidence that IPD meta-analyses were being under-utilised. Only 66 guidelines (37%) cited a matched IPD meta-analysis. Around a third of these (n=22, 34%) had critically appraised the IPD meta-analysis. Recommendations based directly on the matched IPD meta-analyses were identified for only 18 of the 66 guidelines (27%). For the guidelines that did not cite a matched IPD meta-analysis (n=111, 63%), search dates had preceded the publication of the IPD meta-analysis in 23 cases (21%); however, for the remainder, there was no obvious reasons why the IPD meta-analysis had not been cited. CONCLUSIONS:Our results indicate that systematic reviews and meta-analyses based on IPD are being under-utilised. Guideline developers should routinely seek good quality and up to date IPD meta-analyses to inform guidelines. Increased use of IPD meta-analyses could lead to improved guidelines ensuring that routine patient care is based on the most reliable evidence available.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Publishing", "Research Subjects", "Review Literature as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925764176", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7005266088": {"Name": "Vale C.L.", "AuthorID": "7005266088", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "22836554400": {"Name": "Rydzewska L.H.M.", "AuthorID": "22836554400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "7003571463": {"Name": "Rovers M.M.", "AuthorID": "7003571463", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud Institute for Health Sciences, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "6701688192": {"Name": "Emberson J.R.", "AuthorID": "6701688192", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60022323", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit (CTSU), University of Oxford"}, "57217346910": {"Name": "Gueyffier F.", "AuthorID": "57217346910", "AffiliationID": "60012357", "AffiliationName": "Hospices Civils de Lyon, Service de Pharmacologie Clinique and Essais Th\u00e9rapeutiques"}, "7202187065": {"Name": "Stewart L.A.", "AuthorID": "7202187065", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, A/B Block Alcuin College, University of York"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
