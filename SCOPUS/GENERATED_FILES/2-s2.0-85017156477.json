Design: An online survey exploring current practice, skills and confidence of audiologists, and the infrastructure and facilities available in their workplaces, was distributed to audiologists in Malaysia via professional associations and social media. Study sample: A total of 111 audiologists, 84.7% female and 15.3% male (range = 23\u201344 years), participated in the study. Results: Although audiologists in Malaysia reported addressing all of the ICF domains, less than 26% of them assessed the patients\u2019 speech perception, carried out real-ear measurements, or used outcome measures routinely. The majority of the audiologists reported feeling confident in managing adult patients. However, 83% of the audiologists indicated they wanted to improve their skills related to management of adult patients, particularly in the areas of counselling and auditory training. Conclusions: Inadequate infrastructure, resources and facilities in the workplace may have contributed to the gaps in service provision and influenced the current practice of audiological management for adult patients in Malaysia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hearing aids", "Hearing impairment", "older adults", "WHO ICF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Audiologists", "Audiology", "Auditory Perception", "Clinical Competence", "Delivery of Health Care, Integrated", "Disability Evaluation", "Female", "Health Care Surveys", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Hearing", "Hearing Disorders", "Humans", "Malaysia", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Persons With Hearing Impairments", "Prognosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017156477", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57193849904": {"Name": "Ali A.", "AuthorID": "57193849904", "AffiliationID": "60001821", "AffiliationName": "School of Rehabilitation Sciences, National University of Malaysia"}, "7004043266": {"Name": "Hickson L.", "AuthorID": "7004043266", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "26027432100": {"Name": "Meyer C.", "AuthorID": "26027432100", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Queensland"}}}
