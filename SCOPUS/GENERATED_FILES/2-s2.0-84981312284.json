The resulting increasing mutual coupling and correlation among the base station (BS) antennas are incorporated by deriving a practical mutual coupling matrix which considers coupling among all antenna elements. We also provide a realistic analysis of the energy consumption using a new model, taking into account the circuit power consumption as a function of the number of BS antennas and then present a performance analysis of the system with respect to EE. Our analysis shows that while spectral efficiency increases with increasing number of BS antennas in a massive MIMO system, EE does not increase boundlessly when the increasing number of antennas are to be accommodated within a fixed physical space and the total power consumed is considered to be a function of the BS antennas. Accordingly, analytic expressions for the optimum number of antennas to attain maximum EE are obtained.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antenna correlation", "energy efficiency", "massive MIMO", "mutual coupling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna correlation", "Base station antennas", "Circuit power consumption", "Multi user multiple input multiple outputs", "Mutual coupling", "Mutual coupling matrix", "Performance analysis", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981312284", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57189044937": {"Name": "Biswas S.", "AuthorID": "57189044937", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings"}, "16069472900": {"Name": "Ratnarajah T.", "AuthorID": "16069472900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings"}}}
