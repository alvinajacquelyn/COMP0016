The obtained carbon material had an ultra-high specific surface area of 1961 m2 g\u22121 and provided rich active sites for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which in turn resulted in high electrocatalytic activity. It was found that the pore size distribution for the newly prepared carbonaceous material fell in the range of 1\u20134 nm. Benefiting from its high surface area and the presence of pyridine-N and quaternary-N species, the as-prepared carbon material exhibited excellent ORR activity in an oxygen-saturated 0.1 M KOH solution, compared to commercial Pt/C (10 wt%). Due to its high ORR catalytic activity, stability and low-cost, using sheep bone as C and N precursors to produce N-doped carbon provides an encouraging step toward the goal of replacing commercial Pt/C as fuel cell cathode electrocatalyst.", "AuthorKeywords": ["N-doped carbon", "Oxygen oxidation reaction", "Sheep bone", "Ultra-high surface area"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbonaceous materials", "Electrocatalytic activity", "Electrocatalytic performance", "Mesoporous carbon materials", "N-doped", "Oxidation reactions", "Oxygen reduction reaction", "Ultra-high"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019238490", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56673169200": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "56673169200", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology"}, "54415016600": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "54415016600", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology"}, "12802385800": {"Name": "Ji S.", "AuthorID": "12802385800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "26436412000": {"Name": "Wang R.", "AuthorID": "26436412000", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60019496", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology"}, "57191248248": {"Name": "Xu R.", "AuthorID": "57191248248", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003706028": {"Name": "Pollet B.", "AuthorID": "7003706028", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Renewable Energy, Department of Energy and Process Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}}}
