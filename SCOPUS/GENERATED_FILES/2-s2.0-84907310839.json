Given these statistical findings, we argue that, land value tax (LVT), albeit a classic political idea dating back to the early 20th century, does have contemporary relevance and, with modern geographic information technologies, can be rigorously analysed and empirically justified with a view to actual implementation. Levying LVT will not only generate additional fiscal revenues to help finance the development and maintenance of local public infrastructures, but will also ensure a more just distribution of the economic welfare yielded by public investment. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bus stop", "Land value tax", "Property price", "Transport infrastructure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907310839", "SubjectAreas": [["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55894601800": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55894601800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, The Bartlett Faculty of Built Environment, University College London"}, "7801386204": {"Name": "Potoglou D.", "AuthorID": "7801386204", "AffiliationID": "60003873", "AffiliationName": "RAND Europe, Westbrook Centre"}, "6701703252": {"Name": "Orford S.", "AuthorID": "6701703252", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning and Geography, Cardiff University"}, "56127977500": {"Name": "Gong Y.", "AuthorID": "56127977500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Sustainable Places Research Institute, Cardiff University"}}}
