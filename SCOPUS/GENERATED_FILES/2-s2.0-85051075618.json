Thymosin-\u03b24 is a peptide that reduces inflammation and fibrosis and has the potential to restore endothelial and epithelial cell injury, biological processes involved in the pathophysiology of CKD. Therefore, thymosin-\u03b24 could be a novel therapeutic direction for CKD. Areas covered: Here, we review the current evidence on the actions of thymosin-\u03b24 in the kidney in health and disease. Using transgenic mice, two recent studies have demonstrated that endogenous thymosin-\u03b24 is dispensable for healthy kidneys. In contrast, lack of endogenous thymosin-\u03b24 exacerbates mouse models of glomerular disease and angiotensin-II-induced renal injury. Administration of exogenous thymosin-\u03b24, or its metabolite, Ac-SDKP, has shown therapeutic benefits in a range of experimental models of kidney disease. Expert opinion: The studies conducted so far reveal a protective role for thymosin-\u03b24 in the kidney and have shown promising results for the therapeutic potential of exogenous thymosin-\u03b24 in CKD. Further studies should explore the mechanisms by which thymosin-\u03b24 modulates kidney function in different types of CKD. Ac-SDKP treatment has beneficial effects in many experimental models of kidney disease, thus supporting its potential use as a new treatment strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ac-SDKP", "cytoskeleton", "fibrosis", "glomerulus", "inflammation", "kidney disease", "podocyte", "thymosin-\u03b24"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Kidney", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Thymosin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051075618", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"25925539800": {"Name": "Vasilopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "25925539800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "26643015300": {"Name": "Long D.A.", "AuthorID": "26643015300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57194786909": {"Name": "Riley P.R.", "AuthorID": "57194786909", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}}}
