A seller has an object for sale and can reach buyers only through intermediaries. Intermediaries can either mediate the transaction by buying and reselling\u2014the merchant mode\u2014or refer buyers to the seller for a fee\u2014the referral mode. When the seller has a strong bargaining position and can condition the asking price to the intermediaries' business model choice, all intermediaries specialize in agency. The seller's and intermediaries' joint profits equal the seller's profits when he has access to all buyers. When the seller does not have such bargaining power, the level of the referral fee and the degree of competition among intermediaries determine the business mode adoption. A hybrid agency\u2013merchant mode may be adopted in equilibrium. Banning the referral mode can decrease welfare because the merchant mode is associated with additional allocative distortions due to asymmetric information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055442019", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"7005993790": {"Name": "Condorelli D.", "AuthorID": "7005993790", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Essex"}, "12141006200": {"Name": "Galeotti A.", "AuthorID": "12141006200", "AffiliationID": "60024316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, European University Institute"}, "13402878100": {"Name": "Skreta V.", "AuthorID": "13402878100", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, UT Austin & UCL"}}}
