Here we review the latest instrumental concepts and outline related emerging applications. These include security screening, quality control of pharmaceutical and food products, characterisation of objects of art and diagnosis of bone disease and breast cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Art", "Bone", "Cancer", "Food", "Glucose", "Non-invasive", "Security", "SERS", "Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy", "Temperature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cancer", "Non-invasive", "Security", "SERS", "Spatially offset raman spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045711103", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
