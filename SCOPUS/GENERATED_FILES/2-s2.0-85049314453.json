Approximately 10% of SCN neurons express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP); however, it is unknown how firing activity of VIP neurons releases VIP to entrain circadian rhythms. To identify physiologically relevant firing patterns, we optically tagged VIP neurons and characterized spontaneous firing over 3 days. VIP neurons had circadian rhythms in firing rate and exhibited two classes of instantaneous firing activity. We next tested whether physiologically relevant firing affected circadian rhythms through VIP release. We found that VIP neuron stimulation with high, but not low, frequencies shifted gene expression rhythms in vitro through VIP signaling. In vivo, high-frequency VIP neuron activation rapidly entrained circadian locomotor rhythms. Thus, increases in VIP neuronal firing frequency release VIP and entrain molecular and behavioral circadian rhythms. Video Abstract:[Figure presented] Mazuski et al. used optical tagging to characterize the multiday firing activity of neuropeptidergic VIP SCN neurons. They found that increases in VIP neuronal firing frequency entrain circadian rhythms through increased VIP signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["channelrhodopsin", "daily oscillation", "multielectrode array", "neuropeptide", "optogenetic", "Period gene", "suprachiasmatic nucleus", "vasoactive intestinal peptide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Circadian Rhythm", "Female", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neuropeptides", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Suprachiasmatic Nucleus", "Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Neurons", "Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049314453", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55926444700": {"Name": "Mazuski C.", "AuthorID": "55926444700", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "57202774962": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "57202774962", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "14035523700": {"Name": "Hermanstyne T.", "AuthorID": "14035523700", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "56411293000": {"Name": "Jones J.", "AuthorID": "56411293000", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "50462299500": {"Name": "Simon T.", "AuthorID": "50462299500", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "7005487858": {"Name": "Herzog E.", "AuthorID": "7005487858", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "56435587300": {"Name": "Abel J.", "AuthorID": "56435587300", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School"}, "35232822700": {"Name": "Doyle F.", "AuthorID": "35232822700", "AffiliationID": "60077572, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard John A.
