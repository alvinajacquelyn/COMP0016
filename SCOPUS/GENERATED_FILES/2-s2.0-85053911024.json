Published by IOP Publishing Ltd.The decline in the floating sea ice cover in the Arctic is one of the most striking manifestations of climate change. In this review, we examine this ongoing loss of Arctic sea ice across all seasons. Our analysis is based on satellite retrievals, atmospheric reanalysis, climate-model simulations and a literature review. We find that relative to the 1981-2010 reference period, recent anomalies in spring and winter sea ice coverage have been more significant than any observed drop in summer sea ice extent (SIE) throughout the satellite period. For example, the SIE in May and November 2016 was almost four standard deviations below the reference SIE in these months. Decadal ice loss during winter months has accelerated from -2.4 %/decade from 1979 to 1999 to -3.4%/decade from 2000 onwards. We also examine regional ice loss and find that for any given region, the seasonal ice loss is larger the closer that region is to the seasonal outer edge of the ice cover. Finally, across all months, we identify a robust linear relationship between pan-Arctic SIE and total anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The annual cycle of Arctic sea ice loss per ton of CO2 emissions ranges from slightly above 1 m2 throughout winter to more than 3 m2 throughout summer. Based on a linear extrapolation of these trends, we find the Arctic Ocean will become sea-ice free throughout August and September for an additional 800 \u00b1300 Gt of CO2 emissions, while it becomes ice free from July to October for an additional 1400 \u00b1300 Gt of CO2 emissions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arctic", "climate change", "climate modeling", "satellite observations", "sea ice"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arctic", "Atmospheric reanalysis", "Climate model simulations", "Linear extrapolation", "Linear relationships", "Satellite observations", "Satellite retrieval", "Standard deviation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053911024", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6602079010": {"Name": "Stroeve J.", "AuthorID": "6602079010", "AffiliationID": "60000221, 60008778", "AffiliationName": "National Snow and Ice Data Center, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado"}, "9248887100": {"Name": "Notz D.", "AuthorID": "9248887100", "AffiliationID": "60028564", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Meteorology"}}}
