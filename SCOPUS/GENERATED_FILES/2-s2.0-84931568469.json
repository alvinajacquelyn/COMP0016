Design: Cross-sectional analysis of secondary data. Setting: Nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Participants: Five thousand one hundred seven infants aged 3-19 months in 2004. Main outcome measure: Maternal report of immunisation status: incompletely or fully immunised. Results: Overall, 9.3% (473) of infants were incompletely immunised; of these just 16% had mothers who disagreed with immunisation. Remaining analyses focussed on infants whose mother did not disagree with immunisation (. N=. 4994) (of whom 8% [398] were incompletely immunised).Fifteen variables representing potential immunisation barriers and facilitators were available in LSAC; these were entered into a latent class model to identify distinct clusters (or 'classes') of barriers experienced by families. Five classes were identified: (1) 'minimal barriers', (2) 'lone parent, mobile families with good support', (3) 'low social contact and service information; psychological distress', (4) 'larger families, not using formal childcare', (5) 'child health issues/concerns'. Compared to infants from families experiencing minimal barriers, all other barrier classes had a higher risk of incomplete immunisation. For example, the adjusted risk ratio (RR) for incomplete immunisation was 1.51 (95% confidence interval: 1.08-2.10) among those characterised by 'low social contact and service information; psychological distress', and 2.47 (1.87-3.25) among 'larger families, not using formal childcare'. Conclusions: Using the most recent data available for examining these issues in Australia, we found that the majority of incompletely immunised infants (in 2004) did not have a mother who disagreed with immunisation. Barriers to immunisation are heterogeneous, suggesting a need for tailored interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Health inequalities", "Infants", "Population health", "Social disadvantage", "Vaccination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Australia", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Infant", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931568469", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"23397901800": {"Name": "Pearce A.", "AuthorID": "23397901800", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health, University of Adelaide"}, "7004859466": {"Name": "Bedford H.", "AuthorID": "7004859466", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "22985659600": {"Name": "Marshall H.", "AuthorID": "22985659600", "AffiliationID": "60015153", "AffiliationName": "Vaccinology and Immunology Research Trials Unit, Women's and Children's Hospital"}, "7403674871": {"Name": "Lynch J.", "AuthorID": "7403674871", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
