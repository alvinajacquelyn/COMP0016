However, the extent to which mental health evaluators acknowledge the existence of bias, recognize it, and understand the need to guard against it, is unknown. To formally assess beliefs about the scope and nature of cognitive bias, we surveyed 1,099 mental health professionals who conduct forensic evaluations for the courts or other tribunals (and compared these results with a companion survey of 403 forensic examiners, reported in Kukucka, Kassin, Zapf, & Dror, 2017). Most evaluators expressed concern over cognitive bias but held an incorrect view that mere willpower can reduce bias. Evidence was also found for a bias blind spot (Pronin, Lin, & Ross, 2002), with more evaluators acknowledging bias in their peers' judgments than in their own. Evaluators who had received training about bias were more likely to acknowledge cognitive bias as a cause for concern, whereas evaluators with more experience were less likely to acknowledge cognitive bias as a cause for concern in forensic evaluation as well as in their own judgments. Training efforts should highlight the bias blind spot and the fallibility of introspection or conscious effort as a means of reducing bias. In addition, policies and procedural guidance should be developed in regard to best cognitive practices in forensic evaluations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bias blind spot", "Cognitive bias", "Expert decision-making", "Forensic evaluation", "Forensic mental health assessment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035051900", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"7003646152": {"Name": "Zapf P.", "AuthorID": "7003646152", "AffiliationID": "60014511", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, John Jay College of Criminal Justice"}, "7004232087": {"Name": "Kassin S.", "AuthorID": "7004232087", "AffiliationID": "60014511", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, John Jay College of Criminal Justice"}, "55377312500": {"Name": "Kukucka J.", "AuthorID": "55377312500", "AffiliationID": "60004092", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Towson University"}, "7004020479": {"Name": "Dror I.", "AuthorID": "7004020479", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
