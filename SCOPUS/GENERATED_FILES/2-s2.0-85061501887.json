This paper presents an overview of the number of Portuguese academic staff and students working and studying in the UK, from 2007/08 to 2015/16. For students, a breakdown by level of study, university type (member or not member of Russell Group), engineering discipline and gender are provided, as well as data of the first cohort of students starting their Engineering programs following the 2016 Brexit referendum.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Engineering academic staff", "Engineering discipline", "Engineering students", "Gender", "Level of study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Academic staff", "Engineering and technology", "Engineering disciplines", "Engineering program", "Gender", "Higher education", "Level of study"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061501887", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190159954": {"Name": "Direito I.", "AuthorID": "57190159954", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Engineering Education, University College London (UCL)"}, "57205766006": {"Name": "Fowler S.", "AuthorID": "57205766006", "AffiliationID": "122161046", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Prof. Council"}}}
