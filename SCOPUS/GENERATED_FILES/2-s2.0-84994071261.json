The aim of this paper is to provide recommendations for development of models and theories that are informed by, and can inform, digital behavior change interventions based on discussions by international experts, including behavioral, computer, and health scientists and engineers. The proposed framework stipulates the use of a state-space representation to define when, where, for whom, and in what state for that person, an intervention will produce a targeted effect. The \u201cstate\u201d is that of the individual based on multiple variables that define the \u201cspace\u201d when a mechanism of action may produce the effect. A state-space representation can be used to help guide theorizing and identify crossdisciplinary methodologic strategies for improving measurement, experimental design, and analysis that can feasibly match the complexity of real-world behavior change via digital behavior change interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Health Behavior", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Research Design", "Telecommunications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994071261", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"23034393200": {"Name": "Hekler E.", "AuthorID": "23034393200", "AffiliationID": "60015864", "AffiliationName": "School of Nutrition and Health Promotion, Arizona State University"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "7005087897": {"Name": "Pavel M.", "AuthorID": "7005087897", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Consortium on Technology for Proactive Care, Northeastern University"}, "6701576975": {"Name": "Jimison H.", "AuthorID": "6701576975", "AffiliationID": "60028628", "AffiliationName": "Consortium on Technology for Proactive Care, Northeastern University"}, "7006738224": {"Name": "Rivera D.", "AuthorID": "7006738224", "AffiliationID": "60003892", "AffiliationName": "Fulton Schools of Engineering, Arizona State University"}, "7202597093": {"Name": "Collins L.", "AuthorID": "7202597093", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Methodology Center, Pennsylvania State University"}, "56450527300": {"Name": "Garnett C.", "AuthorID": "56450527300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57191842048": {"Name": "Parral S.", "AuthorID": "57191842048", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Center for Economic and Social Research, University of Southern California"}, "6603006948": {"Name": "Spruijt-Metz D.", "AuthorID": "6603006948", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Center for Economic and Social Research, University of Southern California"}}}
