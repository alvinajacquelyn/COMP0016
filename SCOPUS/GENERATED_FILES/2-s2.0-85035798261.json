This standard steric shielding model has recently been challenged by the discovery of stable downstream intermediates, which appear to be involved in the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle. The alternative model, referred to as the Curtin-Hammett scenario of stereocontrol, assumes that the enantioselectivity is related to the stability and reactivity of downstream intermediates. In our present computational study, we examine the two key processes of the catalytic Michael reaction between propanal and \u03b2-nitrostyrene that are relevant to the proposed stereoselectivity models, namely the C-C bond formation and the protonation steps. The free energy profiles obtained for the pathways leading to the enantiomeric products suggest that the rate- and stereodetermining steps are not identical as implied by the previous models. The stereoselectivity can be primarily controlled by C-C bond formation even though the reaction rate is dictated by the protonation step. This kinetic scheme is consistent with all observations of experimental mechanistic studies including those of mass spectrometric back reaction screening experiments, which reveal a mismatch between the stereoselectivity of the back and the forward reactions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["C-C bond formation", "Catalyzed reactions", "Computational studies", "Mechanistic studies", "Michael additions", "Michael reactions", "Rate determining step", "Screening experiments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035798261", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"6506138965": {"Name": "F\u00f6ldes T.", "AuthorID": "6506138965", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "14034144500": {"Name": "Madar\u00e1sz \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "14034144500", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "15829984400": {"Name": "R\u00e9v\u00e9sz \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "15829984400", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "56674656300": {"Name": "Dobi Z.", "AuthorID": "56674656300", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "24177643800": {"Name": "Varga S.", "AuthorID": "24177643800", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7102295347": {"Name": "Hamza A.", "AuthorID": "7102295347", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "6604005700": {"Name": "P\u00e1pai I.", "AuthorID": "6604005700", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60182609", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Organic Chemistry, Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7202146676": {"Name": "Nagy P.R.", "AuthorID": "7202146676", "AffiliationID": "60030035", "AffiliationName": "MTA-BME Lend\u00fclet Quantum Chemistry Research Group, Department of Physical Chemistry and Materials Science, Budapest University of Technology and Economics"}, "6602722398": {"Name": "Pihko P.M.", "AuthorID": "6602722398", "AffiliationID": "60032398", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, NanoScience Center, University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4"}}}
