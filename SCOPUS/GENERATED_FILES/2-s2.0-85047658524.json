A compatible group observed an atypical model that moved rightward, whereas an incompatible group observed an atypical model that moved leftward. Both groups were instructed to observe the model with the intention to later reproduce the movement trajectory. This was examined in a posttest where participants were asked to move rightward with a kinematic profile that matched the atypical kinematics. Compared to a control group that did not engage in practice, and irrespective of whether the stimulus was observed in a spatially compatible or incompatible orientation, participants from both experimental groups reproduced velocity profiles that were comparable and similar to the atypical biological kinematics. Bayesian analysis indicated equality between the 2 experimental groups, thus suggesting comparable sensorimotor processing. Therefore, by rotating the incompatible stimulus by 180 degrees during observational practice, the current study has isolated the processing and representation of atypical biological kinematics to the underlying sensorimotor processes, rather than spatial encoding of peak velocity via processes associated with stimulusresponse compatibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biological kinematics", "Observational practice", "Spatial compatibility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Motion Perception", "Motor Activity", "Psychomotor Performance", "Space Perception", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047658524", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57196078985": {"Name": "Foster N.", "AuthorID": "57196078985", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "7403105607": {"Name": "Bennett S.", "AuthorID": "7403105607", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "36645578100": {"Name": "Causer J.", "AuthorID": "36645578100", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "54796378200": {"Name": "Andrew M.", "AuthorID": "54796378200", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "8629701800": {"Name": "Hayes S.", "AuthorID": "8629701800", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "17342102400": {"Name": "Bird G.", "AuthorID": "17342102400", "AffiliationID": "60115346, 60026851, 60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology and Brasenose College, University of Oxford and MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
