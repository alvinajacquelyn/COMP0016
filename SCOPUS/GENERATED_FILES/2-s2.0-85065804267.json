This paper demonstrates that Squeeziness is not suitable for comparing programs with different input domains. We then extend Squeeziness to Normalised Squeeziness and demonstrate that this is more generally useful.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fault masking", "Formal methods", "Software engineering", "Software testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Error propagation", "Fault masking", "Information theoretic measure", "Test effectiveness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065804267", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57213931369": {"Name": "Clark D.", "AuthorID": "57213931369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003905519": {"Name": "Hierons R.", "AuthorID": "7003905519", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield"}, "57191692675": {"Name": "Patel K.", "AuthorID": "57191692675", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, The University of Sheffield"}}}
