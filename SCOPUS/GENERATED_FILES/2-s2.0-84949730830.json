International Life Sciences Institute.Obesity, low-quality diet, and inactivity are all prevalent among survivors of endometrial cancer. The present review was conducted to assess whether these characteristics are associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Electronic databases, conference abstracts, and reference lists were searched, and researchers were contacted for preliminary results of ongoing studies. The quality of the methodology and reporting was evaluated using appropriate checklists. Standardized mean differences were calculated, and data were synthesized narratively. Eight of the 4385 reports retrieved from the literature were included in the analysis. Four of the 8 studies were cross-sectional, 1 was retrospective, 1 was prospective, and 2 were randomized controlled trials. Obesity was negatively associated with overall HRQoL in 4 of 4 studies and with physical well-being in 6 of 6 studies, while it was positively associated with fatigue in 2 of 4 studies. Meeting the recommendations for being physically active, eating a diet high in fruit and vegetables, and abstaining from smoking were positively associated with overall HRQoL in 2 of 2 studies, with physical well-being in 2 of 3 studies, and with fatigue in 1 of 3 studies. Improvements in fatigue and physical well-being were evident after lifestyle interventions. The findings indicate a healthy lifestyle is positively associated with HRQoL in this population, but the number of studies is limited. Additional randomized controlled trials to test effective and practical interventions promoting a healthy lifestyle in survivors of endometrial cancer are warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diet", "Endometrial Neoplasms", "Exercise", "Fatigue", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Life Style", "Obesity", "Quality of Life", "Smoking", "Survivors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949730830", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"56073260900": {"Name": "Koutoukidis D.", "AuthorID": "56073260900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "6603663157": {"Name": "Knobf M.", "AuthorID": "6603663157", "AffiliationID": "60007879", "AffiliationName": "Acute Care/Health Systems Division, Yale University School of Nursing"}, "10040678500": {"Name": "Lanceley A.", "AuthorID": "10040678500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
