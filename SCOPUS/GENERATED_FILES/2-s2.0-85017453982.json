Methods: Patients (n = 22; 12 female; median age 8 months; range 5\u201311 months) had normal preceding development, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and neurometabolic testing (West syndrome of unknown cause, uWS). Controls were healthy babies (n = 22; 11 female; median age 6 months; range 3\u201312 months). Event-related potentials (ERPs) and psychometry (Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition, BSID-II) took place at a month following IS remission. Results: Following a repeated pure tone, uWS patients showed less suppression of the N100 at the mid-temporal electrodes (p = 0.006), and a prolonged response latency (p = 0.019). Their novelty P300 amplitude over the mid-temporal electrodes was halved (p = 0.001). The peak of the novelty P300 to environmental broadband sounds emerged later over the left temporal lobe in patients (p = 0.015), the lag correlating with duration of spasms (r = 0.547, p = 0.015). BSID-II scores were lower in patients (p < 0.001), with no correlation to ERP. Significance: Complex acoustic information is processed poorly following IS. This would impair language. Treatment did not reverse this phenomenon, but may have limited its severity. The data are most consistent with altered connectivity of the cortical acoustic processing areas induced by IS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory event-related potential", "Infantile spasms", "N100", "Novelty P300", "West syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Auditory Pathways", "Auditory Perception", "Case-Control Studies", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Electroencephalography", "Event-Related Potentials, P300", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Prednisolone", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Reaction Time", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Spasms, Infantile", "Temporal Lobe", "Video Recording", "Vigabatrin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017453982", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"15026440500": {"Name": "Fosi T.", "AuthorID": "15026440500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56457677600": {"Name": "Werner K.", "AuthorID": "56457677600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Vermont"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7201529100": {"Name": "Boyd S.G.", "AuthorID": "7201529100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004346948": {"Name": "De Haan M.", "AuthorID": "7004346948", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Cognitive Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
