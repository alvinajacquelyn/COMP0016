Published by The Geological Society of London.Interpretation of the origin of Oligocene Flysch exposed in the Andaman-Nicobar Islands has been the subject of debate. Previous work on the provenance of the Andaman Flysch based on samples from South Andaman has indicated major contributions from Myanmar affected by the India-Asia collision, mixed with subordinate detritus from the nascent Himalayas. This study examines the provenance of a larger suite of samples that extend to North and Middle Andaman islands as well as Great Nicobar Island. Rather monotonous petrographic and heavy-mineral assemblages testify to strong diagenetic imprint, leading to a poorly constrained identification of the sediment source. U-Pb zircon ages provide more robust and diagnostic provenance discrimination between the Myanmar Arc and the growing Himalayan range. Combining petrographic and min- eralogical data with detrital zircon U-Pb analyses, we find that most of the Andaman Flysch is dominated by a strong continental-crust signal with only a minor contribution from arc material. Statistical analyses of the data show that most of the samples have a provenance similar to Palaeogene Bengal Fan sediments, although the type section on South Andaman has a closer affinity to the provenance of the modern Irrawaddy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027244578", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"55194835200": {"Name": "Limonta M.", "AuthorID": "55194835200", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Provenance Studies, Universitet di Milano-Bicocca"}, "36348470200": {"Name": "Resentini A.", "AuthorID": "36348470200", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Provenance Studies, Universitet di Milano-Bicocca"}, "7003625845": {"Name": "Garzanti E.", "AuthorID": "7003625845", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Laboratory for Provenance Studies, Universitet di Milano-Bicocca"}, "56003358600": {"Name": "Carter A.", "AuthorID": "56003358600", "AffiliationID": "60020990", "AffiliationName": "Geological Survey of India"}, "36944794300": {"Name": "Bandopadhyay P.C.", "AuthorID": "36944794300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
