In order to optimize both alloy chemistry and thermal processing an enhanced understanding of the interphase precipitation mechanism is required. It is proposed that the evolution of inter-sheet spacing of MC carbides during the \u03b3\u2192\u03b1+MC transformation can be explained considering the interfacial segregation and the corresponding dissipation of Gibbs energy inside the moving interphase boundary. The inter-sheet spacing of interphase precipitates is controlled by a complex interplay between the interfacial energy and interfacial segregation, this is presented in form of an analytical model. It is shown that the general trend of refining inter-sheet spacing with growing ferrite half-thickness can be well predicted by the proposed model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HSLA", "Interfacial segregation", "Interphase precipitation", "Super-ledge model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alloy chemistry", "Automotive sheets", "HSLA", "Interfacial segregation", "Interphase boundaries", "Interphase precipitation", "Micro-alloyed steels", "Micro-structural"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017385380", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57188878779": {"Name": "Clark S.", "AuthorID": "57188878779", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Steel Research Centre, University of Warwick"}, "24344055600": {"Name": "Janik V.", "AuthorID": "24344055600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Steel Research Centre, University of Warwick"}, "56219068400": {"Name": "Lan Y.", "AuthorID": "56219068400", "AffiliationID": "60003430, 60010585", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel, Coventry Technology Centre"}, "7102170153": {"Name": "Sridhar S.", "AuthorID": "7102170153", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Steel Research Centre, University of Warwick"}}}
