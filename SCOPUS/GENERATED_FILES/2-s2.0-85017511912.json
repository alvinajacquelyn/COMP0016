Aim To investigate GPs' attitudes towards prescribing tamoxifen. Design and setting In an online survey, GPs in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales (n = 928) were randomised using a 2 \u00d7 2 between-subjects design to read one of four vignettes describing a healthy patient seeking a tamoxifen prescription. Method In the vignette, the hypothetical patient's breast cancer risk (moderate versus high) and the clinician initiating the prescription (GP prescriber versus secondary care clinician[SCC] prescriber) were manipulated in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Outcomes were willingness to prescribe, comfort discussing harms and benefits, comfort managing the patient, factors affecting the prescribing decision, and awareness of tamoxifen and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline CG164. Results Half (51.7%) of the GPs knew tamoxifen can reduce breast cancer risk, and one-quarter (24.1%) were aware of NICE guideline CG164. Responders asked to initiate prescribing (GP prescriber) were less willing to prescribe tamoxifen than those continuing a prescription initiated in secondary care (SCC prescriber) (68.9% versus 84.6%, P<0.001). The GP prescribers reported less comfort discussing tamoxifen (53.4% versus 62.5%, P = 0.01). GPs willing to prescribe were more likely to be aware of the NICE guideline (P = 0.039) and to have acknowledged the benefits of tamoxifen (P<0.001), and were less likely to have considered its off-licence status (P<0.001). Conclusion Initiating tamoxifen prescriptions for preventive therapy in secondary care before asking GPs to continue the patient's care may overcome some prescribing barriers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Chemoprevention", "General practice", "Preventive therapy", "Primary care", "Tamoxifen"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Breast Neoplasms", "Chemoprevention", "Female", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Primary Health Care", "Primary Prevention", "Qualitative Research", "Random Allocation", "Risk Assessment", "Tamoxifen", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017511912", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"55501030300": {"Name": "Smith S.G.", "AuthorID": "55501030300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7006402119": {"Name": "Foy R.", "AuthorID": "7006402119", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care, Institute of Health Sciences, University of Leeds, Worsley Building"}, "7006653902": {"Name": "DeCensi A.", "AuthorID": "7006653902", "AffiliationID": "60018618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Division of Medical Oncology, Ospedali Galliera"}, "7103156622": {"Name": "Cuzick J.", "AuthorID": "7103156622", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57190338002": {"Name": "McGowan J.A.", "AuthorID": "57190338002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Healthcare, University College London"}, "57218348853": {"Name": "Side L.", "AuthorID": "57218348853", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55953676400": {"Name": "Kobayashi L.C.", "AuthorID": "55953676400", "AffiliationID": "60022098, 60032499, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "Center for Population and Development Studies, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, Harvard University"}, "7404382777": {"Name": "Brown K.", "AuthorID": "7404382777", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Studies, University of Leicester"}}}
