Previous investigations suggest that, in general, this phenomenon might have similar underlying reasons across the interested species, despite genetic and behavioral differences. For instance improving the individual safety (e.g. from predators), and increasing the probability to get food resources. Remarkably, the group size might strongly vary from species to species, e.g. shoals of fishes and herds of lions, and sometimes even within the same species, e.g. tribes and families in human societies. Here we build on previous theories stating that the dynamics of group formation may have evolutionary roots, and we explore this fascinating hypothesis from a purely theoretical perspective, with a model using the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory. In our model we hypothesize that homogeneity constitutes a fundamental ingredient in these dynamics. Accordingly, we study a population that tries to form homogeneous groups, i.e. composed of similar agents. The formation of a group can be interpreted as a strategy. Notably, agents can form a group (receiving a \u2018group payoff\u2019), or can act individually (receiving an \u2018individual payoff\u2019). The phase diagram of the modeled population shows a sharp transition between the \u2018group phase\u2019 and the \u2018individual phase\u2019, characterized by a critical \u2018individual payoff\u2019. Our results then support the hypothesis that the phenomenon of group formation has evolutionary roots.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Game Theory", "Species Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033776592", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55601598500": {"Name": "Javarone M.", "AuthorID": "55601598500", "AffiliationID": "60032259", "AffiliationName": "Dept.
