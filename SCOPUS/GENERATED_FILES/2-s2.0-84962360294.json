Compound 1 displayed an MIC of 0.5 mg/L as compared with an MIC of 128 mg/L for the control antibiotic norfloxacin. The structure of the new compound was elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis and mass spectrometry, and experimental and calculated ECD were used to determine the absolute configurations. The compounds \u03b2-sitosterol (2), stigmasterol (3), ergost-5-en-3-ol (4), and osajaxanthone (5) also occurred in the n-hexane fraction. The EtOAc fraction contained nine known xanthones: 3,6-dihydroxy-1,4,8-trimethoxyxanthone (6), 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxyxanthone (7), 3,4-dihydroxy-6,8-dimethoxyxanthone (8), 3,4-dihydroxy-2-methoxyxanthone (9), 5-hydroxy-1,3-dimethoxyxanthone (10), 4-hydroxy-2,3-dimethoxyxanthone (11), kielcorin (12), 3-hydroxy-2-methoxyxanthone (13), and 2-hydroxy-1-methoxyxanthone (14), which showed moderate to low activity against the tested MRSA strains.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Brazil", "Clusiaceae", "Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Molecular Structure", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular", "Phloroglucinol", "Plant Components, Aerial", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Stereoisomerism", "Xanthones"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962360294", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "MEDI", "2707"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"18433373500": {"Name": "Coqueiro A.", "AuthorID": "18433373500", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, S\u00e3o Paulo State University"}, "36067173200": {"Name": "Choi Y.H.", "AuthorID": "36067173200", "AffiliationID": "60017766, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Natural Products Laboratory, Institute of Biology, Leiden University"}, "36041084100": {"Name": "Verpoorte R.", "AuthorID": "36041084100", "AffiliationID": "60017766, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Natural Products Laboratory, Institute of Biology, Leiden University"}, "35867247700": {"Name": "Gupta K.B.S.S.", "AuthorID": "35867247700", "AffiliationID": "60070180, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "NMR Facility, Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Leiden University"}, "26643653300": {"Name": "De Mieri M.", "AuthorID": "26643653300", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Basel"}, "7006641896": {"Name": "Hamburger M.", "AuthorID": "7006641896", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Basel"}, "7404194186": {"Name": "Young M.C.M.", "AuthorID": "7404194186", "AffiliationID": "100606603", "AffiliationName": "Section of Plant Physiology and Biochemistry, Institute of Botany"}, "57189666030": {"Name": "Stapleton P.", "AuthorID": "57189666030", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56232425600": {"Name": "Gibbons S.", "AuthorID": "56232425600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "35588269600": {"Name": "Bolzani V.D.S.", "AuthorID": "35588269600", "AffiliationID": "60006028", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organic Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, S\u00e3o Paulo State University"}}}
