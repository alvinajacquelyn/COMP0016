The key idea behind physical layer security is to utilize the intrinsic randomness of the transmission channel to guarantee the security in physical layer. The evolution toward 5G wireless communications poses new challenges for physical layer security research. This paper provides a latest survey of the physical layer security research on various promising 5G technologies, including physical layer security coding, massive multiple-input multiple-output, millimeter wave communications, heterogeneous networks, non-orthogonal multiple access, full duplex technology, and so on. Technical challenges which remain unresolved at the time of writing are summarized and the future trends of physical layer security in 5G and beyond are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5G", "full duplex", "heterogeneous network", "massive MMO", "mmWave", "NOMA", "physical layer security"], "IndexKeywords": ["Information-theoretic approach", "Millimeter-wave communication", "Mobile communications", "Non-orthogonal multiple access", "Parity check codes", "Physical layer security", "Physical layers", "Wireless communications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045337100", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55767262500": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "55767262500", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "8337591400": {"Name": "Khisti A.", "AuthorID": "8337591400", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Signal Multimedia and Security Laboratory, University of Toronto"}, "7202240414": {"Name": "Xiao C.", "AuthorID": "7202240414", "AffiliationID": "60000060", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lehigh University"}, "7004399543": {"Name": "Caire G.", "AuthorID": "7004399543", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Telecommunication Systems, Technical University Berlin"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403872378": {"Name": "Gao X.", "AuthorID": "7403872378", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}}}
