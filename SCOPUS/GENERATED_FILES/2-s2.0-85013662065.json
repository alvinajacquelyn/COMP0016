Health and Social Care in the Community Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Loneliness in later life is a common problem with poor health outcomes. However, interventions to prevent or ameliorate loneliness have a weak evidence base. The views of older people experiencing or at risk of loneliness in the community are important in identifying features of potential support, but have been little studied. Twenty-eight community dwelling people, aged 65 and over who reported being \u2018lonely much of the time\u2019 or identified as lonely from the de Jong Gierveld six-item loneliness scale in a larger study, participated in in-depth interviews, between June 2013 and May 2014. Views and experiences on seeking support from primary care and community based one-to-one and group based activities, including social and shared interest groups, were explored. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary team, including older people. Using two different measures of loneliness enabled a spectrum of loneliness experience to be explored. Two-thirds of the participants were the \u2018younger old\u2019 and all were able to leave their homes independently. Older people with characteristics of loneliness were generally knowledgeable about local social and community resources but, for the majority, community and primary care based services for their loneliness were not considered desirable or helpful at this point in their lives. However, group based activities with a shared interest were thought preferable to one-to-one support (befriending) or groups with a social focus. Descriptions of support as being for loneliness and specific to older people discouraged engagement. Older people experiencing or at risk of loneliness did not consider that primary care has a role in alleviating loneliness because it is not an illness. They thought primary care practitioners lack understanding of non-physical problems and that a good relationship was necessary to discuss sensitive issues like loneliness. For many, loneliness was a complex and private matter that they wished to manage without external support.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community based interventions", "loneliness", "older people", "primary care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Loneliness", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Primary Health Care", "Professional Role", "Qualitative Research", "Single Person", "Social Behavior", "Social Support"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013662065", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6507886105": {"Name": "Kharicha K.", "AuthorID": "6507886105", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "8214276000": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "8214276000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care & Population Studies, University College London"}, "7006601649": {"Name": "Manthorpe J.", "AuthorID": "7006601649", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London"}, "6701468194": {"Name": "Chew-Graham C.A.", "AuthorID": "6701468194", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care & Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "16021209800": {"Name": "Cattan M.", "AuthorID": "16021209800", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "School of Health, Community and Education Studies, Northumbria University"}, "7202267987": {"Name": "Goodman C.", "AuthorID": "7202267987", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "CRIPACC, Faculty of Health and Human Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57193408237": {"Name": "Kirby-Barr M.", "AuthorID": "57193408237", "AffiliationID": "100985136", "AffiliationName": "Lay Member"}, "57193403642": {"Name": "Whitehouse J.H.", "AuthorID": "57193403642", "AffiliationID": "100985136", "AffiliationName": "Lay Member"}}}
