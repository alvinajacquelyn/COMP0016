Since it follows long term evolution standard, its signal quality is guaranteed and its deployment is straightforward via reusing existing infrastructures. Current NB-IoT supports low data rate services via using low order modulation formats for the purpose of power saving. However, with the increase of data rate driven applications, next generation NB-IoT would require data rate enhancement techniques without consuming extra battery power. In this paper, a downlink framework, using a nonorthogonal signal waveform for next generation enhanced NB-IoT (eNB-IoT), is proposed and experimentally tested in both single-antenna and multiantenna systems. In the single-antenna scenario, waveform precoding is used to pre-equalize the self-created inter carrier interference distorted signal waveform. For the multiantenna multiuser scenario, both waveform and antenna space precoding have to be used. Measured results show that in both single-antenna and multiantenna systems, the proposed signal waveform in eNB-IoT can increase data rate by 11% compared with NB-IoT occupying the same spectral resource in similar receiver computational complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enhanced narrowband Internet of Things (eNB-IoT)", "Multiantenna", "Multiple input multiple output (MIMO)", "Multiuser", "Narrowband 5G", "NB-IoT", "Nonorthogonal", "Precoding", "Prototyping", "Software defined radio (SDR)", "Waveform"], "IndexKeywords": ["Multi-antenna", "Multi-user", "Narrow bands", "Non-orthogonal", "Precoding", "Software-defined radios", "Wave forms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067877106", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55846144300": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "55846144300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
