The three approaches were as follows: the proportion of time that fixations were on pedestrians (14%), a common approach to interpretation; the proportion of fixations at critical moments that were on pedestrians (23%), critical moments being defined by a delayed response to a dual task; and the probability of an approaching pedestrian being fixated at least once (86%). These data were compared against the number of pedestrians encountered during the trials; the proportion of all fixations and the probability of fixating people were affected by the number of people encountered - only the critical-fixations data did not exhibit a trend.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Critical moment", "Delayed response", "Dual-tasks", "Eye-tracking", "Number of peoples", "Visual tasks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925661951", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6602873224": {"Name": "Fotios S.", "AuthorID": "6602873224", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "56031473200": {"Name": "Uttley J.", "AuthorID": "56031473200", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}, "56571783400": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "56571783400", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield"}}}
