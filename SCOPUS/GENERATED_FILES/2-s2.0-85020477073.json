Background: Communication between health professionals influences medication incidents\u2019 occurrence and safe care. Design: An ethnographic study was undertaken. Methods: Semi-structured interviews, observations and focus groups were conducted in three clinical areas of an Australian tertiary paediatric hospital. Data were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed using the Medication Communication Model. Results: The actual communication act revealed health professionals\u2019 commitment to effective medication management and the influence of professional identities on medication communication. Nurses and doctors were dedicated to providing safe, effective medication therapy for children, within their scope of practice and perceived role responsibilities. Most nurses and junior doctors used tentative language in their communication while senior doctors tended to use direct language. Irrespective of language style, nurses actively engaged with doctors to promote patients\u2019 needs. Yet, the medical hierarchical structure, staffing and attendant expectations influenced communication for medication management, causing frustration among nurses and doctors. Doctors\u2019 lack of verbal communication of documented changes to medication orders particularly troubled nurses. Nurses persisted in their efforts to acquire appropriate orders for safe medication administration to paediatric patients. Conclusions: Collaborative practice between nurses and doctors involved complex, symbiotic relationships. Their dedication to providing safe medication therapy to paediatric patients facilitated effective medication management. At times, shortcomings in interdisciplinary communication impacted on potential and actual medication incidents. Relevance to clinical practice: Understanding of the complexities affecting medication communication between nurses and doctors helps to ensure interprofessional respect for each other's roles and inherent demands. Interdisciplinary education delivered in healthcare organisations would facilitate greater clarity in communication related to medications. Encouraging the use of concise, clear words in communication would help to promote improved understanding between parties, and accuracy and efficacy of medication management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collaborative practice", "communication", "ethnography", "interprofessional interactions", "language", "medication communication", "medication management", "nursing", "paediatrics", "patient safety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communication", "Critical Care", "Focus Groups", "Humans", "Medical Staff, Hospital", "Medication Errors", "Medication Therapy Management", "Nursing Staff, Hospital", "Physician-Nurse Relations", "Qualitative Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020477073", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"56368428300": {"Name": "Borrott N.", "AuthorID": "56368428300", "AffiliationID": "60118634, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne School of Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}, "7006934518": {"Name": "Kinney S.", "AuthorID": "7006934518", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Nursing and Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne"}, "6603176897": {"Name": "Newall F.", "AuthorID": "6603176897", "AffiliationID": "60026489", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Haematology, Royal Children's Hospital"}, "15766627000": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "15766627000", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, Monash University"}, "6601977827": {"Name": "Cranswick N.", "AuthorID": "6601977827", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "The University of Melbourne"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "20034711700": {"Name": "Manias E.", "AuthorID": "20034711700", "AffiliationID": "60118634, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Melbourne School of Health Sciences, The University of Melbourne"}}}
