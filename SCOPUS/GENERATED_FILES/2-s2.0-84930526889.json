One putative biological mechanism implicates variability in the ability of cortisol, released in response to stress, to trigger a cascade of adaptive genomic and non-genomic processes through glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Here, we demonstrate that common genetic variants in long-range enhancer elements modulate the immediate transcriptional response to GR activation in human blood cells. These functional genetic variants increase risk for depression and co-heritable psychiatric disorders. Moreover, these risk variants are associated with inappropriate amygdala reactivity, a transdiagnostic psychiatric endophenotype and an important stress hormone response trigger. Network modeling and animal experiments suggest that these genetic differences in GR-induced transcriptional activation may mediate the risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders by altering a network of functionally related stress-sensitive genes in blood and brain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Cohort Studies", "Forecasting", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors", "Stress, Psychological", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930526889", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"54885385900": {"Name": "Arloth J.", "AuthorID": "54885385900", "AffiliationID": "60002571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry"}, "57214576187": {"Name": "Weber P.", "AuthorID": "57214576187", "AffiliationID": "60002571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry"}, "24462012500": {"Name": "Menke A.", "AuthorID": "24462012500", "AffiliationID": "60002571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry"}, "57191412928": {"Name": "Karbalai N.", "AuthorID": "57191412928", "AffiliationID": "60002571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry"}, "36625216100": {"Name": "Czamara D.", "AuthorID": "36625216100", "AffiliationID": "60002571", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry"}, "7004630495": {"Name": "Wurst W.", "AuthorID": "7004630495", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen e.
