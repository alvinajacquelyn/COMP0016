Consensus guidelines recommend surgical intervention in patients with drug refractory symptoms. The primary aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine morbidity and mortality after surgery. Methods: Study Selection: Studies reporting outcomes following surgical intervention for symptomatic LVOTO in HCM. Data Extraction: Articles from searching two scientific databases (PubMed and Web of Science) were reviewed and data were extracted by two investigators. Meta-analysis of data was performed with heterogeneity assessed using I2 statistic. Results: 85 studies were included in the systematic review and 35 studies in the meta-analysis. Contemporary early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) mortality following septal myectomy were 1.4% (CI 0.8, 2.4) I2 9.0%, p = 0.36 and 0.7% (CI 0.3, 1.2) I2 70.7%, p < 0.05 respectively. Sixty-eight studies (80%) reported perioperative complications. The contemporary rate of a perioperative ventricular septal defect was 1.4% (0.8, 2.3) I2 0%, p < 0.05. Late morbidities including atrial fibrillation, stroke, heart failure and transplant were reported in fewer than 22% of studies and few studies compared mortality and clinical outcomes using different surgical approaches to LVOTO. The incidence rate (IR) of reintervention with a further surgical procedure was 0.3% (CI 0.2, 0.4) I2 52.5%, p < 0.05. Conclusions: Contemporary surgical management of LVOTO is associated with low operative mortality rates but further studies are needed to investigate the impact of surgical therapy on non-fatal early and late complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction", "Mitral valve", "Septal Myectomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Management", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Mortality", "Treatment Outcome", "Ventricular Outflow Obstruction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048523296", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57194234840": {"Name": "Collis R.A.", "AuthorID": "57194234840", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield"}, "6504683022": {"Name": "Watkinson O.", "AuthorID": "6504683022", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield"}, "24481305600": {"Name": "Guttmann O.P.", "AuthorID": "24481305600", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield"}, "26644292900": {"Name": "O'Mahony C.", "AuthorID": "26644292900", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield"}, "57202356433": {"Name": "Elliott P.M.", "AuthorID": "57202356433", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield"}, "57210974594": {"Name": "Rahman M.S.", "AuthorID": "57210974594", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Statistical Research and Training (ISRT), University of Dhaka"}}}
