Objective: We examined the association of sarcopenic obesity and changes in muscle strength and weight with the risk of mortality. Design: Participants (n = 6864) were community-dwelling men and women (45.6% men; 54.4% women; mean \u00b1 SD age: 66.2 \u00b1 9.5 y) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Handgrip strength and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) were measured at baseline and at a 4-y follow-up. Individual participant data were linked with death records from National Health Service registries. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as obese individuals (BMI \u226530) in the lowest tertile of sex-specific grip strength (<35.3 kg for men and <19.6 kg for women). Results: There were 906 deaths over a mean follow-up of 8 y. Compared with the reference group (normal BMI and highest handgrip tertile), the risk of all-cause mortality increased as grip strength reduced within each BMI category. For participants in the lowest handgrip tertile, there was little difference in the risk between normal BMI (HR: 3.25; 95% CI: 1.86, 5.65), overweight (HR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.44, 4.35), and obesity (HR: 2.66; 95% CI: 1.86, 3.80) after adjusting for covariates. The risk of all-cause mortality was significantly greater in participants who experienced weight loss over 4 y (HR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.32, 3.71) and/or reduced hand grip strength (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 10.07, 2.17) than in those with stable weight and grip strength, with the highest risk in those with both weight loss and reduced strength (HR: 3.77; 95% CI: 2.54, 5.60). Conclusions: Sarcopenic obesity did not confer any greater risk than sarcopenia alone. Weight loss combined with sarcopenia presented the greatest risk of mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adiposity", "Aging", "Epidemiology", "Mortality", "Muscle strength"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Body Mass Index", "Body Weight", "Cause of Death", "England", "Female", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle Strength", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Risk Factors", "Sarcopenia", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021796462", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}, "9844699900": {"Name": "O'Donovan G.", "AuthorID": "9844699900", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}}}
