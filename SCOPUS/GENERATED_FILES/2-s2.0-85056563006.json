All rights reserved.Objectives To describe the perspectives of clinicians and researchers on identifying, establishing and implementing core outcomes in haemodialysis and their expected impact. Design Face-to-face, semistructured interviews; thematic analysis. Stetting Twenty-seven centres across nine countries. Participants Fifty-eight nephrologists (42 (72%) who were also triallists). Results We identified six themes: reflecting direct patient relevance and impact (survival as the primary goal of dialysis, enabling well-being and functioning, severe consequences of comorbidities and complications, indicators of treatment success, universal relevance, stakeholder consensus); amenable and responsive to interventions (realistic and possible to intervene on, differentiating between treatments); reflective of economic burden on healthcare; feasibility of implementation (clarity and consistency in definition, easily measurable, requiring minimal resources, creating a cultural shift, aversion to intensifying bureaucracy, allowing justifiable exceptions); authoritative inducement and directive (endorsement for legitimacy, necessity of buy-in from dialysis providers, incentivising uptake); instituting patient-centredness (explicitly addressing patient-important outcomes, reciprocating trial participation, improving comparability of interventions for decision-making, driving quality improvement and compelling a focus on quality of life). Conclusions Nephrologists emphasised that core outcomes should be relevant to patients, amenable to change, feasible to implement and supported by stakeholder organisations. They expected core outcomes would improve patient-centred care and outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chronic renal failure", "dialysis", "nephrology", "trials"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude of Health Personnel", "Biomedical Research", "Humans", "Nephrologists", "Nephrology", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Quality of Life", "Renal Dialysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056563006", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"23020354400": {"Name": "Tong A.", "AuthorID": "23020354400", "AffiliationID": "60088495, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "57197846351": {"Name": "Gutman T.", "AuthorID": "57197846351", "AffiliationID": "60088495, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "57191031347": {"Name": "Ju A.", "AuthorID": "57191031347", "AffiliationID": "60088495, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "26039427800": {"Name": "O'Lone E.", "AuthorID": "26039427800", "AffiliationID": "60088495, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "7401926037": {"Name": "Craig J.C.", "AuthorID": "7401926037", "AffiliationID": "60088495, 60026571", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Kidney Research, Children's Hospital at Westmead"}, "36088780600": {"Name": "Crowe S.", "AuthorID": "36088780600", "AffiliationID": "118730631", "AffiliationName": "Crowe Asociates Ltd"}, "13308077100": {"Name": "Gill J.S.", "AuthorID": "13308077100", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, University of British Columbia"}, "56562357300": {"Name": "Harris T.", "AuthorID": "56562357300", "AffiliationID": "115259548", "AffiliationName": "PKD International"}, "6701582254": {"Name": "Hemmelgarn B.R.", "AuthorID": "6701582254", "AffiliationID": "60192953, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "O'Brien Institute of Public Health, University of Calgary"}, "7004680663": {"Name": "Manns B.", "AuthorID": "7004680663", "AffiliationID": "60192953, 60002306", "AffiliationName": "O'Brien Institute of Public Health, University of Calgary"}, "7004549287": {"Name": "Pecoits-Filho R.", "AuthorID": "7004549287", "AffiliationID": "60020004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica Do Paran\u00e1"}, "35374403700": {"Name": "Tugwell P.", "AuthorID": "35374403700", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa"}, "7003620625": {"Name": "Van Biesen W.", "AuthorID": "7003620625", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Renal Division, Ghent University Hospital"}, "13606226000": {"Name": "Wang A.Y.M.", "AuthorID": "13606226000", "AffiliationID": "60006541, 60033020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong"}, "7202992832": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "7202992832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London"}, "7003558140": {"Name": "Winkelmayer W.C.", "AuthorID": "7003558140", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Selzman Institute for Kidney Health, Section of Nephrology, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "36635057700": {"Name": "Sautenet B.", "AuthorID": "36635057700", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, U1246"}, "38362587800": {"Name": "Viecelli A.", "AuthorID": "38362587800", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Queensland"}}}
