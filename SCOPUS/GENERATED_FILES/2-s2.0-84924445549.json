Here, we delineate a pathway downstream of the RhoGEF Pbl/Ect2 that directs this process in a model epithelium. Our data suggest that the release of Pbl/Ect2 from the nucleus at mitotic entry drives Rho-dependent activation of Myosin-II and, in parallel, induces a switch from Arp2/3 to Diaphanous-mediated cortical actin nucleation that depends on Cdc42, aPKC, and Par6. At the same time, the mitotic relocalization of these apical protein complexes to more lateral cell surfaces enables Cdc42/aPKC/Par6 to take on a mitosis-specific function-aiding the assembly of a relatively isotropic metaphase cortex. Together, these data reveal how the repolarization and remodeling of the actomyosin cortex are coordinated upon entry into mitosis to provide cells with the isotropic and rigid form they need to undergo faithful chromosome segregation and division in a crowded tissue environment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Actin-Related Protein 2-3 Complex", "Actomyosin", "Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Cell Nucleus", "Cells, Cultured", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Epithelial Cells", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "GTP-Binding Proteins", "Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors", "Immunoprecipitation", "Mitosis", "Protein Binding", "Protein Kinase C"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924445549", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56522417000": {"Name": "Rosa A.", "AuthorID": "56522417000", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Program in Areas of Basic and Applied Biology (GABBA), University of Porto"}, "36640826700": {"Name": "Vlassaks E.", "AuthorID": "36640826700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, UCL"}, "6701660589": {"Name": "Pichaud F.", "AuthorID": "6701660589", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, UCL"}, "7201826445": {"Name": "Baum B.", "AuthorID": "7201826445", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, UCL"}}}
