In this study we used pulmonary vessel area and flow obtained using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) to implement WIA noninvasively. We hypothesized that this method could detect differences in reflections in PH patients compared with healthy controls and could also differentiate certain PH subtypes. Twenty patients with PH (35% CTEPH and 75% female) and 10 healthy controls (60% female) were recruited. Right and left pulmonary artery (LPA and RPA) flow and area curves were acquired using self-gated golden-angle, spiral, phase-contrast CMR with a 10.5-ms temporal resolution. These data were used to perform WIA on patients and controls. The presence of a proximal clot in CTEPH patients was determined from contemporaneous computed tomography/angiographic data. A backwards-traveling compression wave (BCW) was present in both LPA and RPA of all PH patients but was absent in all controls (P = 6e<sup>-8</sup>). The area under the BCW was associated with a sensitivity of 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) 63-100%] and specificity of 91% (95% CI 75-98%) for the presence of a clot in the proximal PAs of patients with CTEPH. In conclusion, WIA metrics were significantly different between patients and controls; in particular, the presence of an early BCW was specifically associated with PH. The magnitude of the area under the BCW showed discriminatory capacity for the presence of proximal PA clot in patients with CTEPH. We believe that these results demonstrate that WIA could be used in the noninvasive assessment of PH.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging", "Hemodynamics", "Pulmonary hypertension", "Wave intensity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Arterial Pressure", "Blood Flow Velocity", "Cardiac Catheterization", "Case-Control Studies", "Chronic Disease", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pulmonary Artery", "Pulmonary Circulation", "Pulmonary Embolism", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931049362", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57213375872": {"Name": "Quail M.A.", "AuthorID": "57213375872", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "55589453200": {"Name": "Knight D.S.", "AuthorID": "55589453200", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London National Health Services Foundation Trust"}, "36605240600": {"Name": "Steeden J.A.", "AuthorID": "36605240600", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "23985897400": {"Name": "Moledina S.", "AuthorID": "23985897400", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "35393553500": {"Name": "Coghlan J.G.", "AuthorID": "35393553500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London National Health Services Foundation Trust"}, "54975358000": {"Name": "Taelman L.", "AuthorID": "54975358000", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "IBiTech-bioMMeda, iMinds Medical IT, Ghent University"}, "7005378428": {"Name": "Segers P.", "AuthorID": "7005378428", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "IBiTech-bioMMeda, iMinds Medical IT, Ghent University"}}}
