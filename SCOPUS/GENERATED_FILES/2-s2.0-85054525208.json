Objective: This study assessed the effects of SSRI administration on diurnal cortisol secretion in healthy volunteers. Methods: Sixty-four healthy men and women were randomised to receive either 10 mg escitalopram or placebo for six days in a double-blind fashion. On day six of medication, saliva samples were obtained at home for measurement of diurnal cortisol parameters (cortisol slope, cortisol awakening response, total daily cortisol output). Results: Women receiving escitalopram had significantly steeper cortisol slopes across the day compared with those receiving placebo (F(1, 36) = 7.54, p = 0.009). This alteration in cortisol slope was driven by increases in waking cortisol levels (F(1, 35) = 9.21, p = 0.005). Escitalopram did not have any significant effect on the cortisol awakening response or the total daily cortisol output. Conclusions: Flattened cortisol slopes have been seen in depression. The results of this study suggest that escitalopram might exert its therapeutic effect in women in part through correction of a flattened diurnal cortisol rhythm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antidepressants", "Cortisol", "Depression", "Escitalopram", "HPA axis", "SSRIs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Circadian Rhythm", "Citalopram", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Male", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Saliva", "Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054525208", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55926917100": {"Name": "Ronaldson A.", "AuthorID": "55926917100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57201384941": {"Name": "Kostich K.", "AuthorID": "57201384941", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "26023499800": {"Name": "Lazzarino A.I.", "AuthorID": "26023499800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55161663300": {"Name": "Urbanova L.", "AuthorID": "55161663300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55440517500": {"Name": "Carvalho L.A.", "AuthorID": "55440517500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, John Vane Science Centre"}}}
