Hence, over the past two decades, there has been intensivework undertaken to understand African palaeoclimate and tectonics in order to put together a coherent picture of how the environment of Africa has varied over the past 10 Myr. A new consensus is emerging that suggests the unusual geology and climate of EastAfrica created a complex, environmentally very variable setting. This newunderstanding of East African climate has led to the pulsed climate variability hypothesis that suggests the long-term drying trend in EastAfrica was punctuatedbyepisodes of short alternating periods of extreme humidityand aridity which may have driven hominin speciation, encephalization and dispersals out of Africa. This hypothesis is unique as it provides a conceptual framework within which other evolutionary theories can be examined: first, at macro-scale comparing phylogenetic gradualism and punctuated equilibrium; second, at a more focused level of human evolution comparing allopatric speciation, aridity hypothesis, turnover pulse hypothesis, variability selection hypothesis, Red Queen hypothesis and sympatric speciation based on sexual selection. It is proposed that each one of these mechanisms may have been acting on hominins during these short periods of climate variability, which then produce a range of different traits that led to the emergence of new species. In the case of Homo erectus (sensu lato), it is not just brain size that changes but life history (shortened inter-birth intervals, delayeddevelopment), bodysize anddimorphism, shoulder morphology to allow thrown projectiles, adaptation to long-distance running, ecological flexibility and social behaviour. The future of evolutionary research should be to create evidence-based meta-narratives, which encompass multiple mechanisms that select for different traits leading ultimately to speciation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["East Africa", "Hominin", "Human evolution", "Palaeoclimatology", "Pulsed climate variability framework"], "IndexKeywords": ["Africa, Eastern", "Biological Evolution", "Climate", "Genetic Speciation", "Geography", "History, Ancient", "Human Migration", "Humans", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922287386", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"7003590340": {"Name": "Maslin M.", "AuthorID": "7003590340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "12808500300": {"Name": "Shultz S.", "AuthorID": "12808500300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "6701361414": {"Name": "Trauth M.", "AuthorID": "6701361414", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "University of Potsdam, Institute of Earth and Environmental Science"}}}
