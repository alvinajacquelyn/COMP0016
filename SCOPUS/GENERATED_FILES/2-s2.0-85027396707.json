Methods We examined the effect of negative conditioning on cognitive function and amygdala reactivity in 25 FND patients and 20 healthy volunteers (HV). Participants were first conditioned to stimuli paired with negative affective or neutral (CS +/CS \u2212) information. During functional MRI, subjects then performed an instrumental associative learning task to avoid monetary losses in the context of the previously conditioned stimuli. We expected that FND patients would be better at learning to avoid losses when faced with negatively conditioned stimuli (increased harm avoidance). Multi-echo resting state fMRI was also collected from the same subjects and a robust denoising method was employed, important for removing motion and physiological artifacts. Results FND subjects were more sensitive to the negative CS + compared to HV, demonstrated by a reinforcement learning model. Contrary to expectation, FND patients were generally more impaired at learning to avoid losses under both contexts (CS +/CS \u2212), persisting to choose the option that resulted in a negative outcome demonstrated by both behavioural and computational analyses. FND patients showed enhanced amygdala but reduced dorsolateral prefrontal cortex responses when they received negative feedback. Patients also had increased resting state functional connectivity between these two regions. Conclusions FND patients had impaired instrumental avoidance learning, findings that parallel previous observations of impaired action-outcome binding. FND patients further show enhanced behavioural and neural sensitivity to negative information. However, this did not translate to improved avoidance learning. Put together, our findings do not support the theory of harm avoidance in FND. We highlight a potential mechanism by which negative contexts interfere with adaptive behaviours in this under-explored disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amygdala", "Avoidance learning", "Conversion disorder", "Functional neurological disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Amygdala", "Attention", "Avoidance Learning", "Brain Mapping", "Conditioning, Classical", "Conditioning, Operant", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027396707", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56023964400": {"Name": "Morris L.S.", "AuthorID": "56023964400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}, "8449219500": {"Name": "Voon V.", "AuthorID": "8449219500", "AffiliationID": "109248114", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre"}, "14014129900": {"Name": "Mikheenko Y.", "AuthorID": "14014129900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge"}, "57195353338": {"Name": "To B.", "AuthorID": "57195353338", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "56504702800": {"Name": "Baek K.", "AuthorID": "56504702800", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57044757900": {"Name": "Chang-Webb Y.C.", "AuthorID": "57044757900", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "56269932100": {"Name": "Mitchell S.", "AuthorID": "56269932100", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57044700700": {"Name": "Strelchuk D.", "AuthorID": "57044700700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7401952516": {"Name": "Walsh C.", "AuthorID": "7401952516", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "57193267466": {"Name": "Phillips W.", "AuthorID": "57193267466", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "16235254600": {"Name": "Zandi M.", "AuthorID": "16235254600", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "15742634500": {"Name": "Jenaway A.", "AuthorID": "15742634500", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
