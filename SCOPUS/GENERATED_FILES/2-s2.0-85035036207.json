Method: ADHD children received (a) left anodal/right cathodal DLPFC tDCS and (b) sham stimulation in Experiment 1 and (a) left anodal DLPFC/right cathodal OFC tDCS, (b) left cathodal DLPFC/right anodal OFC tDCS, and (c) sham stimulation in Experiment 2. The current intensity was 1 mA for 15 min with a 72-hr interval between sessions. Participants underwent Go/No-Go task, N-back test, Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and Stroop task after each tDCS condition. Results: Anodal left DLPFC tDCS most clearly affected executive control functions (e.g., WM, interference inhibition), while cathodal left DLPFC tDCS improved inhibitory control. Cognitive flexibility/task switching benefited from combined DLPFC-OFC, but not DLPFC stimulation alone. Conclusion: Task-specific stimulation protocols can improve EFs in ADHD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADHD", "cognitive control", "executive function deficits", "prefrontal cortex", "transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035036207", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"57079899900": {"Name": "Nejati V.", "AuthorID": "57079899900", "AffiliationID": "60032873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Shahid Beheshti University"}, "57200526930": {"Name": "Najian A.", "AuthorID": "57200526930", "AffiliationID": "60032873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Shahid Beheshti University"}, "57192210985": {"Name": "Salehinejad M.A.", "AuthorID": "57192210985", "AffiliationID": "60072323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neurosciences, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors"}, "57220456239": {"Name": "Nitsche M.A.", "AuthorID": "57220456239", "AffiliationID": "60013088", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Hospital Bergmannsheil"}, "36646044100": {"Name": "Javadi A.H.", "AuthorID": "36646044100", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}}}
