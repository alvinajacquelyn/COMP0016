The latest progress includes the use of state-of-the art information technology, specific fluorescent dyes, and monoclonal antibodies to obtain more reliable platelet counts. This information allows the accurate and precise enumeration of platelets even in thrombocytopenic patients and the reporting of novel platelet parameters. In the near future, digital image analysis may permit even better platelet analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated platelet counting", "MPV", "Reticulated platelets"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automation", "History, 20th Century", "History, 21st Century", "Platelet Count"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922372919", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"56506708900": {"Name": "D'Souza C.", "AuthorID": "56506708900", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}, "7101991985": {"Name": "Briggs C.", "AuthorID": "7101991985", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College Hospital London"}, "7102377527": {"Name": "Machin S.J.", "AuthorID": "7102377527", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haemostasis Research Unit, Department of Haematology, University College London"}}}
