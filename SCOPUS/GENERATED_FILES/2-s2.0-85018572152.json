New imaging sequences and improvements in magnet design have enabled the creation of higher spatial resolution images. MRI is now a viable alternative imaging modality when compared to both invasive angiography and computed tomographic angiography. The use of blood pool agents has further facilitated the use of MR angiography (MRA); their high molecular weight allows for lower doses of contrast medium administration while their prolonged presence in the blood stream allows for repeated high-quality volumetric imaging of both the arterial and venous circulation. As such, MRA is now no longer constrained by the tight windows for first-pass arterial and venous enhancement, which has resulted in the ability to assess and diagnose a large range of vascular pathologies in both arterial and venous systems. The intent of this review is to highlight MRI findings in common vascular pathologies including peripheral arterial disease (PAD), abnormalities of the abdominal aortic branches, postendovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) endoleak assessment, popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), vascular thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), and vascular malformations. In addition, the latest MRI techniques currently used to optimally assess each of these pathologies will be discussed. Level of Evidence: 5. Technical Efficacy: Stage 3. J. MAGN. RESON.
