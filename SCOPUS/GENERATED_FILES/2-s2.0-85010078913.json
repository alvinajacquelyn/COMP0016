Despite extensive investigations, the mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated, especially in the juvenile, developing brain. Here we characterized lithium distribution in the juvenile mouse brain during 28 days of continuous treatment that result in clinically relevant serum concentrations. By using Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry- (ToF-SIMS) based imaging we were able to delineate temporospatial lithium profile throughout the brain and concurrent distribution of endogenous lipids with high chemical specificity and spatial resolution. We found that Li accumulated in neurogenic regions and investigated the effects on hippocampal neurogenesis. Lithium increased proliferation, as judged by Ki67-immunoreactivity, but did not alter the number of doublecortin-positive neuroblasts at the end of the treatment period. Moreover, ToF-SIMS revealed a steady depletion of sphingomyelin in white matter regions during 28d Li-treatment, particularly in the olfactory bulb. In contrast, cortical levels of cholesterol and choline increased over time in Li-treated mice. This is the first study describing ToF-SIMS imaging for probing the brain-wide accumulation of supplemented Li in situ. The findings demonstrate that this technique is a powerful approach for investigating the distribution and effects of neuroprotective agents in the brain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Body Weight", "Brain", "Dentate Gyrus", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Immunohistochemistry", "Kinetics", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lithium", "Mice", "Molecular Imaging", "Neurogenesis", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010078913", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56670935700": {"Name": "Zanni G.", "AuthorID": "56670935700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56971022200": {"Name": "Di Martino E.", "AuthorID": "56971022200", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "57193016984": {"Name": "Mason C.E.", "AuthorID": "57193016984", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "57192232600": {"Name": "Hellspong G.", "AuthorID": "57192232600", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "7005347938": {"Name": "Blomgren K.", "AuthorID": "7005347938", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "8902428800": {"Name": "Tj\u00e4rnlund-Wolf A.", "AuthorID": "8902428800", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57189458050": {"Name": "Michno W.", "AuthorID": "57189458050", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "14421032500": {"Name": "Hanrieder J.", "AuthorID": "14421032500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35465039300": {"Name": "Pettersson J.", "AuthorID": "35465039300", "AffiliationID": "60022068, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry-Biomedical Centre, Uppsala University"}}}
