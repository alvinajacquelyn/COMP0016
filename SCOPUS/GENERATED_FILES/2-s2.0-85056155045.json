The accuracy of the ReaxFF force field is evaluated through comparing with quantum chemistry (QC) calculations of the barrier heights and species concentrations of PAHs reacting with H and OH radicals. A series of homobinary collisions between PAH molecules/radicals are performed to reveal the influence of temperature, molecular size, PAH composition, and the number of radical sites on the dynamics and kinetics of PAH dimerization. Instead of directly forming the strong covalent bonds, the majority of the binary collisions between PAH radicals are bound with weak intermolecular interactions. Effects of oxygen on PAH radical dimerization are also investigated, which indicates that the oxygenated PAH radicals are less likely to contribute to soot nucleation. In addition, the temperature, PAH characteristic, and radical site dependent collision efficiency for PAH radical-radical combinations is extracted from this study.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binary collisions", "Collision efficiency", "Flame conditions", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)", "Reactive force field", "Species concentration", "Weak intermolecular interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056155045", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56701945600": {"Name": "Mao Q.", "AuthorID": "56701945600", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering, Ministry of Education, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "57117192300": {"Name": "Hou D.", "AuthorID": "57117192300", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering, Ministry of Education, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "17436617500": {"Name": "You X.", "AuthorID": "17436617500", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering, Ministry of Education, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University"}}}
