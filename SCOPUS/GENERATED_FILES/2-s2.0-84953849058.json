Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.Background: Emerging data relating to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cure suggest that vaccination to stimulate the host immune response, particularly cytotoxic cells, may be critical to clearing of reactivated HIV-1-infected cells. However, evidence for this approach in humans is lacking, and parameters required for a vaccine are unknown because opportunities to study HIV-1 reactivation are rare. Methods: We present observations from a HIV-1 elite controller, not treated with combination antiretroviral therapy, who experienced viral reactivation following treatment for myeloma with melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation. Mathematical modeling was performed using a standard viral dynamic model. Enzyme-linked immunospot, intracellular cytokine staining, and tetramer staining were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells; in vitro CD8 T-cell-mediated control of virion production by autologous CD4 T cells was quantified; and neutralizing antibody titers were measured. Results: Viral rebound was measured at 28 000 copies/mL on day 13 post-transplant before rapid decay to <50 copies/mL in 2 distinct phases with t1/2 of 0.71 days and 4.1 days. These kinetics were consistent with an expansion of cytotoxic effector cells and killing of productively infected CD4 T cells. Following transplantation, innate immune cells, including natural killer cells, recovered with virus rebound. However, most striking was the expansion of highly functional HIV-1-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells, at numbers consistent with those applied in modeling, as virus control was regained. Conclusions: These observations provide evidence that the human immune response is capable of controlling coordinated global HIV-1 reactivation, remarkably with potency equivalent to combination antiretroviral therapy. These data will inform design of vaccines for use in HIV-1 curative interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD8", "cure", "elite control", "HIV", "myeloablation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Neutralizing", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cytokines", "Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Melphalan", "Middle Aged", "Models, Theoretical", "Multiple Myeloma", "Myeloablative Agonists", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "Transplantation, Autologous", "Virus Activation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953849058", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57199117655": {"Name": "Smith N.M.G.", "AuthorID": "57199117655", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, University College London"}, "35393992100": {"Name": "McMichael A.J.", "AuthorID": "35393992100", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, University College London"}, "6506006823": {"Name": "Goonetilleke N.", "AuthorID": "6506006823", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "6506026234": {"Name": "Mlcochova P.", "AuthorID": "6506026234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55913967100": {"Name": "Watters S.A.", "AuthorID": "55913967100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "8055335200": {"Name": "Aasa-Chapman M.M.I.", "AuthorID": "8055335200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006765284": {"Name": "Garson J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006765284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55665377800": {"Name": "Ferns R.B.", "AuthorID": "55665377800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Africa Centre for Health and Population Sciences, University of KwaZulu Natal"}, "56848412000": {"Name": "Gupta R.K.", "AuthorID": "56848412000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "22136212200": {"Name": "Rabin N.", "AuthorID": "22136212200", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60162114", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57045205800": {"Name": "Moore S.", "AuthorID": "57045205800", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60162114", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8215533200": {"Name": "Grant P.R.", "AuthorID": "8215533200", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60162114", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56601072600": {"Name": "Edwards S.G.", "AuthorID": "56601072600", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8763134300": {"Name": "Kashuba A.", "AuthorID": "8763134300", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, Eshelman School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "6603144775": {"Name": "Mayor N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603144775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "22942101800": {"Name": "Schellekens J.", "AuthorID": "22942101800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55942654100": {"Name": "Marsh S.G.E.", "AuthorID": "55942654100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7102363214": {"Name": "Perelson A.S.", "AuthorID": "7102363214", "AffiliationID": "60006164", "AffiliationName": "Los Alamos National Laboratory"}}}
