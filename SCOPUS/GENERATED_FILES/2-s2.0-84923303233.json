Following up on Wojtak et al. [Nature (London) 477, 567 (2011)], we present a new measurement. We take advantage of new data from the tenth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We compare the spectroscopic redshift of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with that of galaxies at the outskirts of clusters, using a sample with an average cluster mass of 1014M. We find that these galaxies have an average relative redshift of -11km/s compared with that of BCGs, with a standard deviation of +7 and -5km/s. Our measurement is consistent with that of Wojtak et al. [Nature (London) 477, 567 (2011)]. However, our derived standard deviation is larger, as we take into account various systematic effects, beyond the size of the data set. The result is in good agreement with the predictions from general relativity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Baryon oscillations", "Clusters of galaxies", "General Relativity", "Gravitational potential", "Gravitational redshift", "Sloan Digital Sky Survey", "Spectroscopic surveys", "Systematic effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923303233", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56972334600": {"Name": "Sadeh I.", "AuthorID": "56972334600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56524845500": {"Name": "Feng L.L.", "AuthorID": "56524845500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005760971": {"Name": "Lahav O.", "AuthorID": "7005760971", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
