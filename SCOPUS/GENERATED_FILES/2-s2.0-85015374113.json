Cross-sectional studies provide a snapshot of these disease processes over a large number of people but do not allow us to model the temporal nature of disease, which is essential for modelling detailed prognostic predictions. Longitudinal studies, on the other hand, are used to explore how these processes develop over time in a number of people but can be expensive and time-consuming, and many studies only cover a relatively small window within the disease process. This paper explores the application of intelligent data analysis techniques for building reliable models of disease progression from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. The aim is to learn disease \u2018trajectories\u2019 from cross-sectional data by building realistic trajectories from healthy patients to those with advanced disease. We focus on exploring whether we can \u2018calibrate\u2019 models learnt from these trajectories with real longitudinal data using Baum\u2013Welch re-estimation so that the dynamic parameters reflect the true underlying processes more closely. We use Kullback\u2013Leibler distance and Wilcoxon rank metrics to assess how calibration improves the models to better reflect the underlying dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-sectional studies", "Disease progression", "Markov models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-sectional study", "Disease progression", "Dynamic parameters", "Intelligent data analysis", "Longitudinal study", "Markov model", "Number of peoples", "Underlying dynamics", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Markov Chains", "Prognosis", "Statistics as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015374113", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57210525029": {"Name": "Tucker A.", "AuthorID": "57210525029", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science"}, "36773318000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "36773318000", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science"}, "7004460319": {"Name": "Garway-Heath D.", "AuthorID": "7004460319", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
