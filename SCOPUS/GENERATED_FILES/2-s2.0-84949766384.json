However, a significant proportion of CYP experience difficulties in taking MTX, which may reduce its potential benefits for HRQoL. The aim of this research was to examine how CYP with JIA perceive MTX treatment and how this relates to HRQoL. Methods: CYP aged 8-16 years taking MTX for JIA completed an adapted Parent Adherence Report Questionnaire, which contains 100 mm visual analogue scales, to assess difficulty taking MTX, adherence, frequency of negative reactions and helpfulness of MTX. They also completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Generic and Rheumatology scales. We collected data on age, gender, JIA course, disease duration, MTX duration of use, route and dose. Number of inflamed and limited joints were indicators of disease severity. Results: One hundred sixteen CYP participated. Most considered MTX helpful (median 87; interquartile range (IQR) 50.75-98) and reported adherence was high (median 98; IQR 90-100). There was greater variability on scores for difficulty (median 22; IQR 2-69) and frequency of negative reactions (median 14.5; IQR 1.25-80). Mean (S.D.) scores on the PedsQL Physical and Psychosocial subscales were 71.63 (24.02) and 71.78 (19.59) respectively, indicating poorer HRQoL than that reported by healthy children. After controlling for demographic and disease variables, poorer physical HRQoL was significantly accounted for by greater difficulty in taking MTX. Poorer psychosocial HRQoL was significantly accounted for by subcutaneous MTX administration, a lower rating of MTX helpfulness and a greater reported difficulty in taking MTX. Conclusions: Taking MTX for JIA was viewed as helpful by most CYP but HRQoL was poorer in those who reported greater difficulty in taking MTX.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Juvenile idiopathic arthritis", "Methotrexate", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arthritis, Juvenile", "Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Methotrexate", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949766384", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"]], "AuthorData": {"15721420000": {"Name": "Mulligan K.", "AuthorID": "15721420000", "AffiliationID": "60099152", "AffiliationName": "East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55808072084": {"Name": "Newman S.", "AuthorID": "55808072084", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University London, School of Health Sciences"}, "7004250589": {"Name": "Wedderburn L.R.", "AuthorID": "7004250589", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Inflammation and Rheumatology Section, UCL Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
