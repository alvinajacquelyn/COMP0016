A 2.5 m hydroelastic segmented model was tested with three different centre bow lengths and towed in regular waves in a towing tank. Measurements were made of the model motions, slam loads and vertical bending moments in the model demi-hulls. The model experiments were carried out for a test condition equivalent to a wave height of 2.68 m and a speed of 20 knots at full scale. Bow accelerations and vertical bending moments due to slamming showed significant changes with the change in centre bow, the longest centre bow having the highest wave-induced loads and accelerations. The increased volume of displaced water which is constrained beneath the bow archways is identified as the reason for this increase in the slamming load. In contrast it was found that the length of centre bow has a relatively small effect on the heave and pitch motions in slamming conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Model experiments", "Modeling motions", "Regular waves", "Slamming loads", "Test condition", "Vertical bending moments", "Wave piercing catamaran", "Wave-induced loads"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047514731", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"56287697500": {"Name": "Shahraki J.", "AuthorID": "56287697500", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "University of Tasmania"}, "35600466300": {"Name": "Davis M.", "AuthorID": "35600466300", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "University of Tasmania"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
