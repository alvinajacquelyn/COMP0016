The UO2 film (ca. 100 nm thick) was prepared on a LaAlO3 (100) substrate and its reactions were studied by high-resolution synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS \u2013 C 1 s, O 1 s, and U 4f) and Near-Edge X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (NEXAFS \u2013 C K-edge). Results show a strong interaction of both molecules with the (100) surface at 300 K. Adsorption of acetic acid at 280 K produces acetates. Upon heating their population steadily decreased (XPS C 1 s) and some enolate or ketene-like species (such as CH2=COO(a)) are formed (NEXAFS). Acetaldehyde primarily adsorbed molecularly at 300 K and subsequent annealing to 480 K led to \u03b1-H abstraction making enolates upon interaction with surface O anions. No preferential orientation was detected for acetates while some could be seen for adsorbed acetaldehyde (NEXAFS). Results for the adsorption and reactivity of acetic acid and acetaldehyde on UO2(100) are compared with those of UO2(111) reported previously to further probe into possible structure-sensitive reactions of this actinide metal oxide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acetaldehyde XPS (C1s)", "Acetic acid XPS (C1s)", "Actinide oxide", "NEXAFS C K-edge of acetaldehyde", "NEXAFS C K-edge of acetic acid", "UO2(100) thin film"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actinide metals", "Actinide oxides", "High resolution", "Near edge X-ray absorption fine structures", "Preferential orientation", "Strong interaction", "Structure sensitive reactions", "Synchrotron X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055638866", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"8260127700": {"Name": "Mudiyanselage K.", "AuthorID": "8260127700", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Fundamental Catalysis, Centre for Research and Development (CRD)"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Fundamental Catalysis, Centre for Research and Development (CRD)"}, "7005794100": {"Name": "Burrell A.K.", "AuthorID": "7005794100", "AffiliationID": "60028609", "AffiliationName": "CSE Electrochemical Energy Storage Department, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "7004008811": {"Name": "Senanayake S.D.", "AuthorID": "7004008811", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Division, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}}}
