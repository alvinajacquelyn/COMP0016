Little is known about the prevalence of CKD in individuals with high CD4 cell counts prior to initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We sought to address this knowledge gap. Methods: We describe the prevalence of CKD among 4637 ART-na\u00efve adults (mean age 36.8 years) with CD4 cell counts >500 cells/\u03bcL at enrolment in the Strategic Timing of AntiRetroviral Treatment (START) study. CKD was defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60mL/min/1.73m2 and/or dipstick urine protein \u22651+. Logistic regression was used to identify baseline characteristics associated with CKD. Results: Among 286 [6.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.5%, 6.9%] participants with CKD, the majority had isolated proteinuria. A total of 268 participants had urine protein \u22651+, including 41 with urine protein \u22652+. Only 22 participants (0.5%) had an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60mL/min/1.73m2, including four who also had proteinuria. Baseline characteristics independently associated with CKD included diabetes [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.73; 95% CI 1.05, 2.85], hypertension (aOR 1.82; 95% CI 1.38, 2.38), and race/ethnicity (aOR 0.59; 95% CI 0.37, 0.93 for Hispanic vs. white). Conclusions: We observed a low prevalence of CKD associated with traditional CKD risk factors among ART-na\u00efve clinical trial participants with CD4 cell counts >500 cells/\u03bcL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "Kidney disease", "Strategic timing of antiretroviral treatment (START) trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Chronic Disease", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Kidney Diseases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923350693", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"34771226200": {"Name": "Achhra A.", "AuthorID": "34771226200", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales"}, "7006513758": {"Name": "Mocroft A.", "AuthorID": "7006513758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "35312280000": {"Name": "Ross M.", "AuthorID": "35312280000", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "8944777500": {"Name": "Wyatt C.", "AuthorID": "8944777500", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "54924488100": {"Name": "Ryom L.", "AuthorID": "54924488100", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen HIV Programme, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Department of Infectious Diseases"}, "7201932126": {"Name": "Lucas G.", "AuthorID": "7201932126", "AffiliationID": "60006433", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease, Johns Hopkins Medicine"}, "35225781600": {"Name": "Furrer H.", "AuthorID": "35225781600", "AffiliationID": "60020486, 60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease, Bern University Hospital and University of Bern"}, "35743534300": {"Name": "Neuhaus J.", "AuthorID": "35743534300", "AffiliationID": "60013223", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, University of Minnesota School of Public Health"}, "6507312046": {"Name": "Somboonwit C.", "AuthorID": "6507312046", "AffiliationID": "60007740", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Disease and International Medicine, University of South Florida"}, "35614589500": {"Name": "Kelly M.", "AuthorID": "35614589500", "AffiliationID": "60014427", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Medicine, John Hunter Hospital"}, "57210238979": {"Name": "Gatell J.", "AuthorID": "57210238979", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Institute of Medicine and Dermatology, Infectious Diseases and AIDS Units, Hospital Clinic/IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona"}}}
