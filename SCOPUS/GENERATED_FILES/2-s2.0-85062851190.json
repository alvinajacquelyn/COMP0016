Colonisation prevalence data in Cambodia are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine gastrointestinal colonisation prevalence of ESC-resistant E. coli (ESC-R-EC) and K. pneumoniae (ESC-R-KP) in Cambodian children/adolescents and associated socio-demographic risk factors; and to characterise relevant resistance genes, their genetic contexts, and the genetic relatedness of ESC-R strains using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Results: Faeces and questionnaire data were obtained from individuals < 16 years in north-western Cambodia, 2012. WGS of cultured ESC-R-EC/KP was performed (Illumina). Maximum likelihood phylogenies were used to characterise relatedness of isolates; ESC-R-associated resistance genes and their genetic contexts were identified from de novo assemblies using BLASTn and automated/manual annotation. 82/148 (55%) of children/adolescents were ESC-R-EC/KP colonised; 12/148 (8%) were co-colonised with both species. Independent risk factors for colonisation were hospitalisation (OR: 3.12, 95% CI [1.52-6.38]) and intestinal parasites (OR: 3.11 [1.29-7.51]); school attendance conferred decreased risk (OR: 0.44 [0.21-0.92]. ESC-R strains were diverse; the commonest ESC-R mechanisms were bla CTX-M 1 and 9 sub-family variants. Structures flanking these genes were highly variable, and for bla CTX-M-15, - 55 and - 27 frequently involved IS26. Chromosomal bla CTX-M integration was common in E. coli. Conclusions: Gastrointestinal ESC-R-EC/KP colonisation is widespread in Cambodian children/adolescents; hospital admission and intestinal parasites are independent risk factors. The genetic contexts of bla CTX-M are highly mosaic, consistent with rapid horizontal exchange. Chromosomal integration of bla CTX-M may result in stable propagation in these community-associated pathogens.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cambodia", "Carriage", "ESBL", "Paediatric"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Cambodia", "Carrier State", "Cephalosporins", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Infections", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Klebsiella Infections", "Klebsiella pneumoniae", "Male", "Parasitic Diseases", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062851190", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"35977000400": {"Name": "Van Aartsen J.J.", "AuthorID": "35977000400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Infection, Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool, Ronald Ross Building"}, "57195934063": {"Name": "Moore C.E.", "AuthorID": "57195934063", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR-OxBRC), University of Oxford"}, "57203052211": {"Name": "Davies T.", "AuthorID": "57203052211", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR-OxBRC), University of Oxford"}, "53663441600": {"Name": "Giess A.", "AuthorID": "53663441600", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR-OxBRC), University of Oxford"}, "56428668100": {"Name": "Sheppard A.E.", "AuthorID": "56428668100", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR-OxBRC), University of Oxford"}, "7005772816": {"Name": "Peto T.E.A.", "AuthorID": "7005772816", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR-OxBRC), University of Oxford"}, "7102132600": {"Name": "Crook D.W.", "AuthorID": "7102132600", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR-OxBRC), University of Oxford"}, "7403910584": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "7403910584", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (NIHR-OxBRC), University of Oxford"}, "16242353500": {"Name": "Stoesser N.", "AuthorID": "16242353500", "AffiliationID": "60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology/Infectious Diseases, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7102561318": {"Name": "Parry C.M.", "AuthorID": "7102561318", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "7402095559": {"Name": "Turner P.", "AuthorID": "7402095559", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "36071528500": {"Name": "Day N.P.J.", "AuthorID": "36071528500", "AffiliationID": "60012718, 60175823", "AffiliationName": "Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University"}, "57190489337": {"Name": "Phot N.", "AuthorID": "57190489337", "AffiliationID": "100712273", "AffiliationName": "Angkor Hospital for Children"}, "57207758559": {"Name": "Mao S.", "AuthorID": "57207758559", "AffiliationID": "100712273", "AffiliationName": "Angkor Hospital for Children"}, "56910106800": {"Name": "Suy K.", "AuthorID": "56910106800", "AffiliationID": "100712273", "AffiliationName": "Angkor Hospital for Children"}}}
