It looks at how men on horseback were represented in paintings, literature, art and literary criticism, and cartoons from 1915 to 1966, while they were losing their importance in military strategy and warfare. Considering both written and visual images as means to rewrite the past, the article aims to reflect upon the links between imagery, cultural tradition, history and ideology: as a powerful icon, the image of men on horseback functions as a key to follow and understand the political and cultural developments of fifty crucial years of Italian history.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benito Mussolini", "Cavalrymen", "Emanuele Luzzati", "Fascism", "Filippo Tommaso Marinetti", "Futurism", "Gino Severini", "Giulio Gianini", "Images", "Italo Calvino", "Knights", "Rewriting", "Umberto Boccioni", "War"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046105182", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"]], "AuthorData": {"38261658700": {"Name": "Sica B.", "AuthorID": "38261658700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
