But as well as what news you read, the way you choose and read that news is also known to be highly individual. We propose a framework for extending the user profile of news readers with features of these interactions. The extensions are dynamic through monitoring an individual's reading and browsing activity. They include factors learned from the user's interaction log and also factors inferred from category level definitions contained in the framework. We report a study in which users' interaction logs with a news app are used to generate user profiles that are verified with self-reported questionnaire data about reading habits. We discuss the implications of our user modeling approach in news personalisation for both recommendation and user interface personalisation for news apps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["News Reading Behaviour", "Personalisation", "User Modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Individual choice", "News Reading Behaviour", "News recommendation", "Personalisation", "Questionnaire data", "User Modeling", "User profile"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051460130", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"55515206300": {"Name": "Constantinides M.", "AuthorID": "55515206300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36165166700": {"Name": "Dowell J.", "AuthorID": "36165166700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
