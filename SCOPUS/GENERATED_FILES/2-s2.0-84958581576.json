Numerous studies demonstrate gender differences in attitudes to risk and loss in financial decision-making, often finding that women are more loss and risk averse than men. It is unclear what drives these effects and whether cyclically varying hormonal differences between men and women contribute to differences in economic preferences. We focus here on how economic rationality and preferences change as a function of menstrual cycle phase in women. We tested adherence to the Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP), the standard test of economic rationality. If choices satisfy GARP then there exists a well-behaved utility function that the subject's decisions maximize.We also examined whether risk attitudes and loss aversion change as a function of cycle phase.We found that, despite large fluctuations in hormone levels, women are as technically rational in their choice behavior as their male counterparts at all phases of the menstrual cycle. However, women are more likely to choose risky options that can lead to potential losses while ovulating; during ovulation women are less loss averse than men and therefore more economically rational than men in this regard. These findings may have market-level implications: ovulating women more effectively maximize expected value than do other groups.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Choice Behavior", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Menstrual Cycle", "Risk-Taking", "Sex Characteristics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958581576", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35364370400": {"Name": "Lazzaro S.", "AuthorID": "35364370400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "7101911123": {"Name": "Rutledge R.", "AuthorID": "7101911123", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "16644970900": {"Name": "Burghart D.", "AuthorID": "16644970900", "AffiliationID": "60013649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Sacramento State University"}, "6603900600": {"Name": "Glimcher P.", "AuthorID": "6603900600", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neural Science, New York University"}}}
