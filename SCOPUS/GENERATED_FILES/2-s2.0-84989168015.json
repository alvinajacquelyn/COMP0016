Detailed understanding of this step is in part hampered by the large heterogeneity in the physicochemical properties of lipid nanoparticles, such as liposomes, making conventional ensemble-averaging methods too blunt to address details of this complex process. Here, we contribute a means to explore whether individual liposomes become deformed upon binding to fluid cell-membrane mimics. This was accomplished by using hydrodynamic forces to control the propulsion of nanoscale liposomes electrostatically attracted to a supported lipid bilayer. In this way, the size of individual liposomes could be determined by simultaneously measuring both their individual drift velocity and diffusivity, revealing that for a radius of \u223c45 nm, a close agreement with dynamic light scattering data was observed, while larger liposomes (radius \u223c75 nm) displayed a significant deformation unless composed of a gel-phase lipid. The relevance of being able to extract this type of information is discussed in the context of membrane fusion and cellular uptake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hydrodynamic propulsion", "liposome deformation", "single particle tracking", "supported lipid bilayer", "TIRF microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular membranes", "Conformational change", "Hydrodynamic forces", "Lipid nanoparticles", "Physicochemical property", "Single particle tracking", "Supported lipid bilayers", "TIRF microscopy", "Cell Membrane", "Hydrodynamics", "Lipid Bilayers", "Liposomes", "Nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989168015", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35182070900": {"Name": "Tabaei S.", "AuthorID": "35182070900", "AffiliationID": "60118812, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomimetic Sensor Science, Nanyang Technological University"}, "16177628100": {"Name": "Gillissen J.", "AuthorID": "16177628100", "AffiliationID": "60118812, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomimetic Sensor Science, Nanyang Technological University"}, "16432736900": {"Name": "Cho N.", "AuthorID": "16432736900", "AffiliationID": "60118456, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}, "34869110500": {"Name": "Block S.", "AuthorID": "34869110500", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "23050730500": {"Name": "H\u00f6\u00f6k F.", "AuthorID": "23050730500", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
