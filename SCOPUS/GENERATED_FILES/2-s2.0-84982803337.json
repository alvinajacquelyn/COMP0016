The regularized least squares or least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) formulation is used for signal estimation. The measurement matrix is assumed to be constructed by concatenating several randomly orthogonal bases, which we refer to as structurally orthogonal matrices. Such measurement matrix is highly relevant to large-scale compressive sensing applications because it facilitates rapid computation and parallel processing. Using the replica method in statistical physics, we derive the mean-squared-error (MSE) formula of reconstruction over the structurally orthogonal matrix in the large-system regime. Extensive numerical experiments are provided to verify the analytical result. We then consider the analytical result to investigate the MSE behaviors of the LASSO over the structurally orthogonal matrix, with an emphasis on performance comparisons with matrices with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian entries. We find that structurally orthogonal matrices are at least as good as their i.i.d. Gaussian counterparts. Thus, the use of structurally orthogonal matrices is attractive in practical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compressed sensing", "LASSO", "orthogonal measurement matrix", "the replica method"], "IndexKeywords": ["LASSO", "Least absolute shrinkage and selection operators", "Numerical experiments", "Orthogonal measurement", "Performance comparison", "Recovery performance", "Regularized least squares", "Replica method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982803337", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7201367144": {"Name": "Wen C.", "AuthorID": "7201367144", "AffiliationID": "60011357", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Communications Engineering, National Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55961790800": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "55961790800", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "24444199100": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "24444199100", "AffiliationID": "60033110", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optoelectronics and Communication Engineering, National Kaohsiung Normal University"}, "24473792300": {"Name": "Yuen C.", "AuthorID": "24473792300", "AffiliationID": "60104290", "AffiliationName": "Singapore University of Technology and Design"}}}
