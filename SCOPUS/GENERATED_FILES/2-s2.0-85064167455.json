In this study, we sought to modify the crystal form of itraconazole (ITZ) with suberic acid (SUB) via rapid solvent removal methods, namely rotary evaporation and spray drying. A phase pure ITZ-SUB cocrystal, which could not be obtained by traditional cocrystallization methods, was successfully prepared by rotary evaporation. The new cocrystal was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Spray drying was further employed for particle engineering of ITZ-SUB to achieve optimal pulmonary delivery. By manipulating the critical processing parameters, inhalable ITZ-SUB agglomerates with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2.56 \u00b1 2.27 \u03bcm and fine particle fraction of 64.10% w/w were reproducibly prepared. The inhalable powders contained mainly coamorphous ITZ-SUB, while a small portion of cocrystals still exists. Compared with the raw ITZ, the intrinsic dissolution rate of the ITZ-SUB cocrystal was 39 times faster, and a significantly larger fraction of ITZ-SUB agglomerates was dissolved after 180 min of the test. Besides, both products remained stable after 1-month storage at 60 \u00b0C. \u00a9", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dissolution rates", "Fine particle fractions", "Mass median aerodynamic diameters", "Particle engineering", "Pharmaceutical products", "Powder X ray diffraction", "Processing parameters", "Pulmonary delivery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064167455", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57205689192": {"Name": "Weng J.", "AuthorID": "57205689192", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57203591253": {"Name": "Wong S.N.", "AuthorID": "57203591253", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57203585474": {"Name": "Xu X.", "AuthorID": "57203585474", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57205690175": {"Name": "Xuan B.", "AuthorID": "57205690175", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "54996796900": {"Name": "Chow S.F.", "AuthorID": "54996796900", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "55816953700": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "55816953700", "AffiliationID": "60015427, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota"}, "36804304200": {"Name": "Sun C.C.", "AuthorID": "36804304200", "AffiliationID": "60015427, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "Pharmaceutical Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory, Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota"}, "57208225608": {"Name": "Chen R.", "AuthorID": "57208225608", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "55927970800": {"Name": "Lakerveld R.", "AuthorID": "55927970800", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "12646007800": {"Name": "Kwok P.C.L.", "AuthorID": "12646007800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Sydney"}}}
