Still, the roles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis regulatory RNAs and the proteins that facilitate their functions remain elusive, although there can be no doubt that RNA biology plays a central role in the baterium's adaptation to its many host environments. In this review, we have presented examples from model organisms and from M. tuberculosis to showcase the abundance and versatility of regulatory RNA, in order to emphasise the importance of these 'fine-tuners' of gene expression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Post-transcriptional regulation", "Regulatory RNA", "Riboregulation", "Riboswitch", "Small RNA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aconitate Hydratase", "Bacterial Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid", "Riboswitch", "RNA Stability", "RNA, Bacterial", "RNA, Small Cytoplasmic", "RNA, Small Nuclear", "RNA, Small Untranslated", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050820807", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55899490200": {"Name": "Schwenk S.", "AuthorID": "55899490200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6505971527": {"Name": "Arnvig K.", "AuthorID": "6505971527", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
