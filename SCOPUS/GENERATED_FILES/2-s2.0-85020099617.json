Ongoing successes in cancer treatment are expected to result in a further increase in the number of long-term survivors. However, cancer treatment can have detrimental cardiovascular side-effects that impact morbidity and mortality, reducing quality of life in cancer survivors. The spectrum of radiotherapy- and chemotherapy-induced cardiovascular disease is broad, varying from subclinical valvular dysfunction to overt congestive heart failure, and such effects may not be apparent for more than twenty years after the initial cancer treatment. Awareness of these long-term side-effects is of crucial value in the management of these patients, in order to reduce the impact of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the long-term cardiovascular complications of cancer treatments (radiotherapy and chemotherapy) in adult cancer survivors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer survivor", "Cardio-oncology", "Cardiotoxicity", "Cardiovascular disease", "Chemotherapy", "Radiotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Cancer Survivors", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Humans", "Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020099617", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57194431817": {"Name": "Naaktgeboren W.", "AuthorID": "57194431817", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "56532444800": {"Name": "Linschoten M.", "AuthorID": "56532444800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7102305152": {"Name": "Cramer M.", "AuthorID": "7102305152", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7006736234": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "7006736234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "22235274900": {"Name": "Teske A.", "AuthorID": "22235274900", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division of Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7004091625": {"Name": "de Graeff A.", "AuthorID": "7004091625", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "57194425165": {"Name": "v Rhenen A.", "AuthorID": "57194425165", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Haematology, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "35511852200": {"Name": "Maas A.", "AuthorID": "35511852200", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Radboud University Medical Centre"}}}
