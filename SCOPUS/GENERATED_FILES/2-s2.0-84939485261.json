With this method we find a meet-completion for ordered domain algebras which simultaneously serves as the base of a representation for such algebras, thereby proving that ordered domain algebras have the finite representation property. We show that many of the equations defining ordered domain algebras are preserved in this completion but associativity, (D2) and (D6) can fail.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Completion", "Finite representation property", "Ordered domain algebra", "Partially ordered set"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939485261", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"55091103900": {"Name": "Egrot R.", "AuthorID": "55091103900", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Information and Communication Technology, Mahidol University"}, "7201906651": {"Name": "Hirsch R.", "AuthorID": "7201906651", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College"}}}
