Eight methods are described, and each is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations of a typical psychophysical experiment. The best method is shown to be one based on a measure of spread known as Sn. This is shown to be more sensitive than popular heuristics based on standard deviations from the mean, and more robust than non-parametric methods based on percentiles or interquartile range. Matlab code for computing Sn is included.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive neuroscience", "Statistics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Datasets as Topic", "Heuristics", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Monte Carlo Method", "Psychophysics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065990645", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57079316000": {"Name": "Jones P.R.", "AuthorID": "57079316000", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
