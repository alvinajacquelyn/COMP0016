We account for full, multidimensional, unsteady hydrodynamics and incorporate a range of relevant EOSs (polytropic, QEOS-type, and SESAME). In doing so, we show that simplified analytic EOSs, like ideal gas, capture certain critical parameters of the collapse such as velocity of the main transverse jet and pressure at jet strike, while also providing a good representation of overall trends. However, more sophisticated EOSs yield different and more relevant estimates of temperature and density, especially for higher incident shock strengths. We model incident shocks ranging from 0.1 to 1000 GPa, the latter being of interest in investigating the warm dense matter regime for which experimental and theoretical EOS data are difficult to obtain. At certain shock strengths, there is a factor of two difference in predicted density between QEOS-type and SESAME EOS, indicating cavity collapse as an experimental method for exploring EOS in this range.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cavity collapse", "Driven cavity", "Equation of state", "Experimental methods", "Incident shock", "Shock strength", "Transverse jet", "Warm dense matters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971329272", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"27667929500": {"Name": "Tully B.", "AuthorID": "27667929500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford"}, "55320006600": {"Name": "Hawker N.", "AuthorID": "55320006600", "AffiliationID": "60113431", "AffiliationName": "First Light Fusion Ltd."}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
