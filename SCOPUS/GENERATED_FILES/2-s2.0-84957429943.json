Using nationally representative data for Britain, we find that job-related well-being was stable between 2001 and 2006, but then declined between 2006 and 2012. We report relevant changes in job quality. In modelling the determinants of job-related well-being, we confirm several previously-studied hypotheses and present some new findings: downsizing, work re-organisation, decreased choice, and linking pay to organisational performance each reduce well-being; indicators of skills challenge in jobs have more of a positive association with Enthusiasm than with Contentment, while effort has a more negative association with Contentment than with Enthusiasm. Our estimates are largely orthogonal to the effects of personality traits and demographic controls on well-being. Using a standard decomposition, we find that the 2006\u20132012 fall in job-related well-being is partly accounted for by accelerations in the pace of workplace change, rising job insecurity, increased effort and changing participation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Downsizing", "Effort", "Job insecurity", "Job-related well-being", "Organisational participation", "Performance-related pay", "Skill", "Task discretion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957429943", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"35467454700": {"Name": "Green F.", "AuthorID": "35467454700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "LLAKES Centre, UCL Institute of Education"}, "6701751604": {"Name": "Felstead A.", "AuthorID": "6701751604", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University"}, "7006023169": {"Name": "Gallie D.", "AuthorID": "7006023169", "AffiliationID": "60010018, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield College, Oxford University"}, "56305101000": {"Name": "Inanc H.", "AuthorID": "56305101000", "AffiliationID": "60009357", "AffiliationName": "OECD"}}}
