In doing so, decision makers are prone to making errors, either by assuming that the level of threat dictates spatial priorities for action or by relying primarily on the location of mapped threats to choose possible actions. We show that threat mapping can be a useful tool when incorporated within a transparent and repeatable structured decision-making (SDM) process. SDM ensures transparent and defendable conservation decisions by linking objectives to biodiversity outcomes, and by considering constraints, consequences of actions, and uncertainty. If used to make conservation decisions, threat maps are best developed with an understanding of how species respond to actions that mitigate threats. This approach will ensure that conservation actions are prioritized where they are most cost-effective or have the greatest impact, rather than where threat levels are highest.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926634391", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"55647748700": {"Name": "Tulloch V.J.D.", "AuthorID": "55647748700", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60160439", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "56354783500": {"Name": "Auerbach N.A.", "AuthorID": "56354783500", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60160439", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "8530143500": {"Name": "Beger M.", "AuthorID": "8530143500", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60160439", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "36628317100": {"Name": "Giakoumi S.", "AuthorID": "36628317100", "AffiliationID": "60003230", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Marine Biological Resources and Inland Waters, Hellenic Centre for Marine Research"}, "25031826200": {"Name": "McDonald-Madden E.", "AuthorID": "25031826200", "AffiliationID": "60025804", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Land and Water Flagship, Ecosciences Precinct"}, "55516662500": {"Name": "Murray N.J.", "AuthorID": "55516662500", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecosystem Science, University of New South Wales"}, "56245010000": {"Name": "Ringma J.", "AuthorID": "56245010000", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60160439", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions, School of Biological Sciences, University of Queensland"}, "7006846637": {"Name": "Possingham H.P.", "AuthorID": "7006846637", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Life Sciences"}, "15752345400": {"Name": "Tulloch A.I.T.", "AuthorID": "15752345400", "AffiliationID": "60082291, 60008950", "AffiliationName": "Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University"}, "55213700400": {"Name": "Watson J.E.M.", "AuthorID": "55213700400", "AffiliationID": "60001012", "AffiliationName": "Global Conservation Program, Wildlife Conservation Society"}, "56517567900": {"Name": "Barnes M.", "AuthorID": "56517567900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Planning and Environmental Management, University of Queensland"}, "37076858300": {"Name": "Evans M.C.", "AuthorID": "37076858300", "AffiliationID": "60082291, 60008950", "AffiliationName": "Fenner School of Environment and Society, Australian National University"}, "26647965400": {"Name": "Visconti P.", "AuthorID": "26647965400", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Computational Science Laboratory, Microsoft Research"}, "7103099423": {"Name": "Halpern B.S.", "AuthorID": "7103099423", "AffiliationID": "60020760", "AffiliationName": "National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis"}, "6507138908": {"Name": "Chad\u00e8s I.", "AuthorID": "6507138908", "AffiliationID": "60025804", "AffiliationName": "CSIRO Land and Water Flagship, Ecosciences Precinct"}}}
