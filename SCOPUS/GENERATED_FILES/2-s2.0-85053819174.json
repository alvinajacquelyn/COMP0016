The mechanism through which the wave energy is absorbed in the nonlinear system is analysed. The mathematical model used is based on the velocity potential theory together with the fully nonlinear boundary conditions on the moving body surface and deforming free surface. The problem is solved by the boundary element method. Numerical results are obtained to show how to adjust the mechanical properties of the OWSC to achieve the best efficiency in a given wave, together with the nonlinear effect of the wave height. Numerical results are also provided to show the behaviour of a given OWSC in waves of different frequencies and different heights.", "AuthorKeywords": ["boundary element method", "nonlinear wave/structure interactions", "oscillating wave surge converter", "wave energy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Different frequency", "Different heights", "Hydrodynamic performance", "Nonlinear waves", "Numerical results", "Oscillating wave surge converters", "Velocity potentials", "Wave energy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053819174", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55433992900": {"Name": "Sun S.", "AuthorID": "55433992900", "AffiliationID": "60069706", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture & Ocean Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London, Torrington Place"}, "57214320174": {"Name": "Sun S.", "AuthorID": "57214320174", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}}}
