Attributed to the following reasons: (1) both core and branch are pseudocapacitively active materials, (2) the special dendritic structure with considerable inter-nanowire space enables easy access of electrolyte to the core and branch surfaces, and (3) the highly conductive NiCo 2 S 4 nanowire cores provide superhighways for charge transition, NiCo 2 S 4 -cored dendritic heterojunction electrodes synergistically lead to ultrahigh specific capacitance, good rate capability, and excellent cycling life. These results of core/branch dentritic heterojunction arrays is universially superior to their core/shell conterparts, thus this is a significant improvement of overall electrochemical performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923100719", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24475575100": {"Name": "Zou R.", "AuthorID": "24475575100", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "54882046300": {"Name": "Yuen M.", "AuthorID": "54882046300", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "16464316100": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "16464316100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "8242699400": {"Name": "Hu J.", "AuthorID": "8242699400", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}}}
