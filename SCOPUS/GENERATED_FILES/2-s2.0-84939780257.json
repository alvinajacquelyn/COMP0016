In addition, statins have proven neuroprotective effects in several neurological diseases: stroke, cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Relatively few studies have investigated the potential anti-seizure properties of statins in epilepsy and the possible underlying protective mechanisms that may be involved. This review summarizes the currently available data concerning statin effects in modulating seizure activity (sometimes adversely) and epileptogenesis in different experimental models as well as in clinical studies. Furthermore, we analyze the consequences of some of the more commonly reported statin\u2013anticonvulsant drug interactions in the literature, discuss some of the adverse effects of statins encountered in clinical practice and comment on the potential future usefulness of statins in epilepsy therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adverse effects", "Atorvastatin", "Epileptogenesis", "Fluvastatin", "Lovastatin", "Pravastatin", "Seizures", "Simvastatin", "Statinantiepileptic drug (AED) interactions", "Statins"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anticonvulsants", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Drug Interactions", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939780257", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"23487110900": {"Name": "Scicchitano F.", "AuthorID": "23487110900", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "13806486700": {"Name": "Citraro R.", "AuthorID": "13806486700", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "57201386594": {"Name": "De Sarro G.", "AuthorID": "57201386594", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "57200140760": {"Name": "Russo E.", "AuthorID": "57200140760", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University \u201cMagna Graecia\u201d of Catanzaro"}, "7006013892": {"Name": "Constanti A.", "AuthorID": "7006013892", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
