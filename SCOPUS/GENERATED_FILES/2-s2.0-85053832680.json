Annually, it is estimated that around 20000 new cases of tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) cancers are diagnosed, with the majority of cases exhibiting a TRK genomic rearrangement. In this Perspective, we discuss current development and clinical applications for TRK precision medicine by providing the following: (1) the biological background and significance of the TRK kinase family, (2) a compilation of known TRK inhibitors and analysis of their cocrystal structures, (3) an overview of TRK clinical trials, and (4) future perspectives for drug discovery and development of TRK inhibitors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Catalytic Domain", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Neoplasms", "Precision Medicine", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptor, trkA", "Receptor, trkB", "Receptor, trkC"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053832680", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57207383526": {"Name": "Yan W.", "AuthorID": "57207383526", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "57200992795": {"Name": "Lakkaniga N.R.", "AuthorID": "57200992795", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "57218941137": {"Name": "Lv F.", "AuthorID": "57218941137", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "56433543900": {"Name": "Gunaganti N.", "AuthorID": "56433543900", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "55215012300": {"Name": "Frett B.", "AuthorID": "55215012300", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "37077499000": {"Name": "Li H.Y.", "AuthorID": "37077499000", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "55925394000": {"Name": "Carlomagno F.", "AuthorID": "55925394000", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Istituto di Endocrinologia e Oncologia Sperimentale Del CNR"}, "57202725105": {"Name": "Santoro M.", "AuthorID": "57202725105", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Medicina Molecolare e Biotecnologie Mediche, Universit\u00e0 Federico II"}, "7102832898": {"Name": "McDonald N.Q.", "AuthorID": "7102832898", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck College"}}}
