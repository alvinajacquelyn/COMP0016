This assumption is violated when the models are fitted to an outcome variable that counts the number of correctly answered questions in a questionnaire. Examples include investigations of cognitive decline where models are fitted to Mini Mental State Examination scores, the most widely used test to measure global cognition. Mini Mental State Examination scores take integer values in the 0-30 range, and its distribution has strong ceiling and floor effects. This article explores alternative distributions for the outcome variable in mixed models fitted to mini mental state examination scores from a longitudinal study of ageing. Model fit improved when a beta-binomial distribution was chosen as the distribution for the response variable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beta binomial", "Cognitive test", "random effects models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964220723", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"35206359500": {"Name": "Muniz-Terrera G.", "AuthorID": "35206359500", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging"}, "55304534200": {"Name": "Hout A.", "AuthorID": "55304534200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7006636469": {"Name": "Rigby R.", "AuthorID": "7006636469", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "STORM Research Centre, London Metropolitan University"}, "6603301160": {"Name": "Stasinopoulos D.", "AuthorID": "6603301160", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "STORM Research Centre, London Metropolitan University"}}}
