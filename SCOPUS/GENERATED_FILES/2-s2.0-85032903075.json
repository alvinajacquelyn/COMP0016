KGaA, WeinheimMetal\u2013organic anion channels based on Zn10L15 pentagonal prisms have been prepared by subcomponent self-assembly. The insertion of these prisms into lipid membranes was investigated by ion-current and fluorescence measurements. The channels were found to mediate the transport of Cl\u2212 anions through planar lipid bilayers and into vesicles. Tosylate anions were observed to bind and plug the central channels of the prisms in the solid state and in solution. In membranes, dodecyl sulfate blocked chloride transport through the central channel. Our Zn10L15 prism thus inserts into lipid bilayers to turn on anion transport, which can then be turned off through addition of the blocker dodecyl sulfate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["lipid membranes", "metal\u2013organic cages", "subcomponent self-assembly", "supramolecular chemistry", "synthetic ion channels"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anion transport", "Central channels", "Dodecyl sulfate", "Fluorescence measurements", "Lipid membranes", "Metal organic", "Pentagonal prisms", "Synthetic ion channels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032903075", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"35974995200": {"Name": "Haynes C.", "AuthorID": "35974995200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "37067987300": {"Name": "Riddell I.", "AuthorID": "37067987300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Current address: School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "9436784200": {"Name": "Ronson T.", "AuthorID": "9436784200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7006312850": {"Name": "Nitschke J.", "AuthorID": "7006312850", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "24068267500": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "24068267500", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "22933920500": {"Name": "Chimerel C.", "AuthorID": "22933920500", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "35775224700": {"Name": "Hern\u00e1ndez-Ainsa S.", "AuthorID": "35775224700", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "22134881300": {"Name": "Keyser U.", "AuthorID": "22134881300", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
