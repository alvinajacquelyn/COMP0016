Objective: To compare disease-free survival time (DFS) between radiofrequency-induced thermo-chemotherapy effect (RITE) and institutional standard second-line therapy (control) in NMIBC patients with recurrence following induction/maintenance BCG. Design, settings, and participants: Open-label, phase III randomised controlled trial accrued across 14 centres between May 2010 and July 2013 (HYMN [ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01094964]). Intervention: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to RITE (60 min, 40 mg mitomycin-C, 42 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) or control following stratification for carcinoma in situ (CIS) status (present/absent), therapy history (failure of previous induction/maintenance BCG), and treatment centre. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Primary outcome measures were DFS and complete response (CR) at 3 mo for the CIS at randomisation subgroup. Analysis was based on intention-to-treat. Results and limitations: A total of 104 patients were randomised (48 RITE: 56 control). Median follow-up for the 31 patients without a DFS event was 36 mo. There was no significant difference in DFS between treatment arms (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84\u20132.10, p = 0.23) or in 3-mo CR rate in CIS patients (n = 71; RITE: 30% vs control: 47%, p = 0.15). There was no significant difference in DFS between treatment arms in non-CIS patients (n = 33; RITE: 53% vs control: 24% at 24 mo, HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.22\u20131.17, p = 0.11). DFS was significantly lower in RITE than in control in CIS with/without papillary patients (n = 71; HR 2.06, 95% CI 1.17\u20133.62, p = 0.01; treatment-subgroup interaction p = 0.007). Disease progression was observed in four patients in each treatment arm. Adverse events and health-related quality of life between treatment arms were comparable. Conclusions: DFS was similar between RITE and control. RITE may be a second-line therapy for non-CIS recurrence following BCG failure; however, confirmatory trials are needed. RITE patients with CIS with/without papillary had lower DFS than control. HYMN highlights the importance of the control arm when evaluating novel therapies. Patient summary: This study did not show a difference in bladder cancer outcomes between microwave-heated chemotherapy and standard of care treatment. Papillary bladder lesions may benefit from microwave-heated chemotherapy treatment; however, more research is needed. Both treatments are similarly well tolerated. Radiofrequency-induced thermo-chemotherapy effect (RITE) had similar oncological outcomes as control. RITE-treated noncarcinoma in situ (CIS) patients reported nonsignificant better disease-free survival (DFS). RITE-treated CIS with/without papillary patients had significantly lower DFS. Control arm is essential when evaluating novel therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BCG failure", "Bladder cancer", "Chemotherapy", "Device-assisted therapy", "Hyperthermia", "Mitomycin-C", "Radiofrequency", "Randomised controlled trial", "Thermotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravesical", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Agents", "BCG Vaccine", "Carcinoma in Situ", "Female", "Humans", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Mitomycin", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Radiofrequency Therapy", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054013219", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57201942956": {"Name": "Tan W.S.", "AuthorID": "57201942956", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "12793936300": {"Name": "Feneley M.R.", "AuthorID": "12793936300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57196277721": {"Name": "Panchal A.", "AuthorID": "57196277721", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "24597632800": {"Name": "Buckley L.", "AuthorID": "24597632800", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "12782624500": {"Name": "Devall A.J.", "AuthorID": "12782624500", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "55763132000": {"Name": "Loubi\u00e8re L.S.", "AuthorID": "55763132000", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "57190161789": {"Name": "Pope A.M.", "AuthorID": "57190161789", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "6701365284": {"Name": "Billingham L.J.", "AuthorID": "6701365284", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, University of Birmingham"}, "15722086100": {"Name": "Cresswell J.", "AuthorID": "15722086100", "AffiliationID": "60030723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, James Cook University Hospital"}, "37087106400": {"Name": "Issa R.", "AuthorID": "37087106400", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, St George's Hospital"}, "57217803444": {"Name": "Mostafid H.", "AuthorID": "57217803444", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Royal Surrey County Hospital"}, "6603653649": {"Name": "Madaan S.", "AuthorID": "6603653649", "AffiliationID": "60026392", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Darent Valley Hospital"}, "15049250300": {"Name": "Bhatt R.", "AuthorID": "15049250300", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "12774961300": {"Name": "McGrath J.", "AuthorID": "12774961300", "AffiliationID": "60013785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital"}, "6602580453": {"Name": "Sangar V.", "AuthorID": "6602580453", "AffiliationID": "60012927", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Withington Hospital"}, "7102183445": {"Name": "Griffiths T.R.L.", "AuthorID": "7102183445", "AffiliationID": "60015908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Leicester General Hospital"}, "57213071621": {"Name": "Page T.", "AuthorID": "57213071621", "AffiliationID": "60018514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Freeman Hospital"}, "57118973400": {"Name": "Hodgson D.", "AuthorID": "57118973400", "AffiliationID": "60030999", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Queen Alexandra Hospital"}, "7401498143": {"Name": "Datta S.N.", "AuthorID": "7401498143", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital of Wales"}}}
