We aimed to assess the feasibility, the safety and the reproducibility of ESE, using on-line scanning in semi-supine cyclo-ergometer protocol in a large pediatric population. Between July 2008 and January 2013, 42 patients (mean age 14 \u00b1 3) were evaluated with a bicycle ESE performing 50 studies. ESE was successfully performed and well tolerated by all patients. None of the patients presented with adverse effects of stress-induced ischemia. HR was 82 \u00b1 13 at rest, and 153 \u00b1 19.1 during peak exercise. Among 544 views analyzed for grading of image quality, the visualization was optimal in 473 (87 %), suboptimal in 39, and inadequate in 32 (6 %). 37 tests were performed in patients with congenital or acquired coronary abnormality. Regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) were revealed in nine cases (24 %). The agreement between the two different observers showed a K index of 0.7276 (95 % CI 0.6497\u20130.8055) for the image quality and a K index of 0.5125 (95 % CI 0.4782\u20130.5468) for the RWMA analysis. Among ten patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, we were able to demonstrate the new comparison of significant left ventricular outflow tract gradient (\u226530 mmHg) during exercise in three patients (30 %). Bicycle stress echocardiography performed by on-line scanning during exercise is a feasible, safe, and reproducible modality in children. Further data to assess its diagnostic accuracy are, however, needed. Stress echocardiography provides a dynamic assessment of the myocardial structure and function under conditions of physiologic or pharmacologic stress.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronary artery disease", "Echocardiography", "Exercise test", "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy", "Pediatric cardiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Child", "Coronary Vessels", "Echocardiography, Stress", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Heart", "Humans", "Male", "Risk Assessment", "Supine Position", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925535091", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56432781800": {"Name": "Ciliberti P.", "AuthorID": "56432781800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "55763090700": {"Name": "McLeod I.", "AuthorID": "55763090700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "54934582200": {"Name": "Cairello F.", "AuthorID": "54934582200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "16204898600": {"Name": "Kaski J.P.", "AuthorID": "16204898600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "9250715500": {"Name": "Fenton M.", "AuthorID": "9250715500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "7006043205": {"Name": "Giardini A.", "AuthorID": "7006043205", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "17635293700": {"Name": "Marek J.", "AuthorID": "17635293700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
