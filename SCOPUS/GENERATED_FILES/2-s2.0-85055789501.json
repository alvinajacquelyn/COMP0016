Endrullis, H. N. Hansen, D. Hendriks, A. Polonsky, and A. Silva.We present a coinductive framework for defining and reasoning about the infinitary analogues of equational logic and term rewriting in a uniform way. We define Equation found, the infinitary extension of a given equational theory =R, and \u2192\u221e, the standard notion of infinitary rewriting associated to a reduction relation \u2192R, as follows: (Formula Presented) Equation found Here \u03bc and \u03bd are the least and greatest fixed-point operators, respectively, and (Formula Presented) Equation found The setup captures rewrite sequences of arbitrary ordinal length, but it has neither the need for ordinals nor for metric convergence. This makes the framework especially suitable for formalizations in theorem provers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coinduction", "Infinitary equational reasoning", "Infinitary rewriting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coinduction", "Equational logic", "Equational reasoning", "Equational theory", "Greatest fixed points", "Infinitary rewriting", "Term rewriting", "Theorem provers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055789501", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"14831171200": {"Name": "Endrullis J.", "AuthorID": "14831171200", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, VU University"}, "16444186700": {"Name": "Hendriks D.", "AuthorID": "16444186700", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, VU University"}, "8367117800": {"Name": "Hansen H.H.", "AuthorID": "8367117800", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Systems and Services, Delft University of Technology"}, "55794626600": {"Name": "Polonsky A.", "AuthorID": "55794626600", "AffiliationID": "60123660, 60123796", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale, Paris Diderot University"}, "23398564400": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "23398564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
