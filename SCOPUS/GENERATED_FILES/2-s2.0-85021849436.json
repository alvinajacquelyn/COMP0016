During the clinical development of the PARP inhibitor class of agents, a subset of women without BRCA mutations were shown to respond to these drugs (termed \"BRCAness\"). It was hypothesized that other genetic abnormalities causing a homologous recombinant deficiency (HRD) were sensitizing the BRCA wild-type cancers to PARP inhibition. The molecular basis for these other causes of HRD are being defined. They include individual gene defects (e.g., RAD51 mutation, CHEK2 mutation), homozygous somatic loss, and whole genome properties such as genomic scarring. Testing this knowledge is possible when selecting patients to receive molecular therapy targeting DNA repair, not only for patients with ovarian cancer but also endometrial and cervical cancers. The validity of HRD assays and multiple gene sequencing panels to select a broader population of patients for treatment with PARP inhibitor therapy is under evaluation. Other non-HRD targets for exploiting DNA repair defects in gynecologic cancers include mismatch repair (MMR), checkpoint signaling, and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. This article describes recent evidence supporting strategies in addition to BRCA mutation for selecting patients for treatment with PARP inhibitor therapy. Additionally, the challenges and opportunities of exploiting DNA repair pathways other than homologous recombination for molecular therapy in gynecologic cancers is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["BRCA1 Protein", "BRCA2 Protein", "DNA End-Joining Repair", "DNA Mismatch Repair", "DNA Repair-Deficiency Disorders", "Female", "Genital Neoplasms, Female", "Homologous Recombination", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021849436", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8771515300": {"Name": "Kristeleit R.S.", "AuthorID": "8771515300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60013409, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "United Kingdom, Clinical Investigations Branch, From the Department of Medical Oncology, University College London Hospital, United Kingdom; UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute"}, "57206687867": {"Name": "Miller R.E.", "AuthorID": "57206687867", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60013409, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "United Kingdom, Clinical Investigations Branch, From the Department of Medical Oncology, University College London Hospital, United Kingdom; UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute"}, "24352265200": {"Name": "Kohn E.C.", "AuthorID": "24352265200", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60013409, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "United Kingdom, Clinical Investigations Branch, From the Department of Medical Oncology, University College London Hospital, United Kingdom; UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, National Cancer Institute"}}}
