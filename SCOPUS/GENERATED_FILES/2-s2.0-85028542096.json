HIV-associated immune dysfunction has been suggested to contribute to increased AANCC risk. Here we performed a cross-sectional immune phenotype analysis of T cells in ART-treated HIV-1-positive individuals with undetectable vireamia (HIV-positives) and HIV-1-negative individuals (HIV-negatives) over 45 years of age. In addition, two control groups were studied: HIV negative adults selected based on lifestyle and demographic factors (Co-morBidity in Relation to AIDS, or COBRA) and unselected age-matched donors from a blood bank. Despite long-term ART (median of 12.2 years), HIV-infected adults had lower CD4+ T-cell counts and higher CD8+ T-cell counts compared to well-matched HIV-negative COBRA participants. The proportion of CD38+HLA-DR+ and PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells was higher in HIV-positive cohort compared to the two HIV-negative cohorts. The proportion CD57+ and CD27\u2212CD28\u2212 cells of both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells in HIV-positives was higher compared to unselected adults (blood bank) as reported before but this difference was not apparent in comparison with well-matched HIV-negative COBRA participants. Multiple regression analysis showed that the presence of an increased proportion of terminally differentiated T cells was strongly associated with CMV infection. Compared to appropriately selected HIV-negative controls, HIV-positive individuals on ART with long-term suppressed viraemia exhibited incomplete immune recovery and increased immune activation/exhaustion. CMV infection rather than treated HIV infection appears to have more consistent effects on measures of terminal differentiation of T cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Blood Donors", "Case-Control Studies", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Differentiation", "Cytomegalovirus", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "HIV Seropositivity", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Life Style", "Lymphocyte Activation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028542096", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"37039453000": {"Name": "Booiman T.", "AuthorID": "37039453000", "AffiliationID": "60138854", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development"}, "55895043600": {"Name": "Girigorie A.F.", "AuthorID": "55895043600", "AffiliationID": "60138854", "AffiliationName": "Amsterdam Institute for Global Health and Development"}, "35573960500": {"Name": "Maurer I.", "AuthorID": "35573960500", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "35573400200": {"Name": "Harskamp A.M.", "AuthorID": "35573400200", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "6603966335": {"Name": "Kootstra N.A.", "AuthorID": "6603966335", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam Infection and Immunity Institute, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam"}, "6701695606": {"Name": "Wit F.W.", "AuthorID": "6701695606", "AffiliationID": "60172322", "AffiliationName": "HIV Monitoring Foundation"}, "7005073010": {"Name": "Reiss P.", "AuthorID": "7005073010", "AffiliationID": "60172322", "AffiliationName": "HIV Monitoring Foundation"}, "56074756400": {"Name": "De Francesco D.", "AuthorID": "56074756400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.A.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7102085623": {"Name": "Prins M.", "AuthorID": "7102085623", "AffiliationID": "60031916", "AffiliationName": "Public health service"}, "56236886700": {"Name": "Franceschi C.", "AuthorID": "56236886700", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Alma Mater Studiorum Universita di Bologna"}, "7006700221": {"Name": "Deeks S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006700221", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of California"}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
