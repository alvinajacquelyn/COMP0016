These tools can lead users through clear steps and suggest optimal decision paths or may act more as information sources to improve the evidence base for decisions. Yet, despite their availability in a wide range of formats, studies in several countries have shown uptake to be disappointingly low. This paper uses a mixed methods approach to investigate the factors affecting the uptake and use of decision support tools by farmers and advisers in the UK. Through a combination of qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys, we found that fifteen factors are influential in convincing farmers and advisers to use decision support tools, which include usability, cost-effectiveness, performance, relevance to user, and compatibility with compliance demands. This study finds a plethora of agricultural decision support tools in operation in the UK, yet, like other studies, shows that their uptake is low. A better understanding of the fifteen factors identified should lead to more effective design and delivery of tools in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision support systems", "Decision support tools", "Evidence-based decision-making", "Human-computer interactions, sustainable intensification"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988962268", "SubjectAreas": [["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Agronomy and Crop Science", "AGRI", "1102"]], "AuthorData": {"56237745800": {"Name": "Rose D.C.", "AuthorID": "56237745800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "56804497000": {"Name": "Sutherland W.J.", "AuthorID": "56804497000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "57204891217": {"Name": "Amano T.", "AuthorID": "57204891217", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Cambridge"}, "8230738500": {"Name": "Dicks L.V.", "AuthorID": "8230738500", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia"}, "57207281736": {"Name": "Parker C.", "AuthorID": "57207281736", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "6603330594": {"Name": "Lobley M.", "AuthorID": "6603330594", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Land, Environment, Policy & Economics Institute, College of Social Sciences and International Studies, University of Exeter"}, "7202444172": {"Name": "Winter M.", "AuthorID": "7202444172", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Land, Environment, Policy & Economics Institute, College of Social Sciences and International Studies, University of Exeter"}, "26632267900": {"Name": "Morris C.", "AuthorID": "26632267900", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Social Sciences, School of Geography, University of Nottingham"}, "57191344866": {"Name": "Twining S.", "AuthorID": "57191344866", "AffiliationID": "60006769", "AffiliationName": "ADAS UK Ltd."}, "56270786100": {"Name": "Ffoulkes C.", "AuthorID": "56270786100", "AffiliationID": "60006769", "AffiliationName": "ADAS UK Ltd."}}}
