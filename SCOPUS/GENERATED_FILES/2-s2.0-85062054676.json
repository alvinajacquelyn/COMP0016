These research efforts have identified gut hormones as key regulators of energy and glucose homeostasis and have implicated them in the pathogenesis of obesity, the weight recidivism that frequently plagues dietary interventions and the marked changes in eating behaviour, weight reduction and metabolic benefits that accompany bariatric surgery. Consequently, therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating gut hormone levels or targeting their receptors are now being used to treat people with obesity and obesity-associated diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, and represent the most promising therapeutic avenue to combat the obesity epidemic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GLP-1", "Gut hormones", "Obesity", "Obesity treatment", "PYY", "Weight loss"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062054676", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"57206865074": {"Name": "Mok J.K.", "AuthorID": "57206865074", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, UCLH Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57190406494": {"Name": "Makaronidis J.M.", "AuthorID": "57190406494", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, UCLH Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7004418512": {"Name": "Batterham R.L.", "AuthorID": "7004418512", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, UCLH Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
