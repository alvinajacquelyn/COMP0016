In partial DGS (pDGS), other risk factors could predispose to recurrent infections, autoimmunity, and allergy. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different factors in the development of infections, autoimmunity, and/or allergy in patients with pDGS. We studied 467 pDGS patients in follow-up at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Using a multivariate approach, we observed that palatal anomalies represent a risk factor for the development of recurrent otitis media with effusion. Gastroesophageal reflux/dysphagia and asthma/rhinitis represent a risk factor for the development of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. Allergy and autoimmunity were associated with persistently low immunoglobulin M levels and lymphopenia, respectively. Patients with autoimmunity showed lower levels of CD3+, CD3+CD4+, and na\u00efve CD4+CD45RA+CD27+ T lymphocytes compared with pDGS patients without autoimmunity. We also observed that the physiological age-related decline of the T-cell number was slower in pDGS patients compared with age-matched controls. The age-related recovery of the T-cell number depended on a homeostatic peripheral proliferation of T cells, as suggested by an accelerated decline of the na\u00efve T lymphocytes in pDGS as well as a more skewed T-cell repertoire in older pDGS patients. These evidences suggest that premature CD4+ T-cell aging and lymphopenia induced spontaneous peripheral T-cell proliferation might contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmunity in patients with pDGS. Infections in these patients represent, in most of the cases, a complication of anatomical or gastroenterological anomalies rather than a feature of the underlying immunodeficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autoimmunity", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "DiGeorge Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068198387", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36559406000": {"Name": "Giardino G.", "AuthorID": "36559406000", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "56313570700": {"Name": "Radwan N.", "AuthorID": "56313570700", "AffiliationID": "60016618", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Allergy and Immunology Unit, Ain Sham University"}, "14028685800": {"Name": "Koletsi P.", "AuthorID": "14028685800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55601754300": {"Name": "Ip W.", "AuthorID": "55601754300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "12786401200": {"Name": "Worth A.", "AuthorID": "12786401200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57207906480": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57207906480", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7003891382": {"Name": "Gaspar H.B.", "AuthorID": "7003891382", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "25932742800": {"Name": "Davies E.G.", "AuthorID": "25932742800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "21741217500": {"Name": "Ladomenou F.", "AuthorID": "21741217500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Immunology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "51665450600": {"Name": "Morrogh D.M.", "AuthorID": "51665450600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7402058288": {"Name": "Adams S.", "AuthorID": "7402058288", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "SIHMDS-Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57209590877": {"Name": "Meyer-Parsonson I.", "AuthorID": "57209590877", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
