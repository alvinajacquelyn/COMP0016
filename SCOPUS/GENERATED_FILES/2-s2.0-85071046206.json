This paper examines the importance of transdisciplinary boundary organisations in generating and mobilising this knowledge. It introduces \u2018urban observatories\u2019 as an example of institutions catalysing information that can shape urban governance, considering in detail the experience of the Gauteng City-Region Observatory (GCRO) in South Africa. Insights drawn from GCRO\u2019s recent work illustrate key operational considerations for these types of boundary institutions, highlighting opportunities and challenges in shaping the knowledge systems that underpin contemporary policymaking in and for cities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["boundary organisations", "co-production", "knowledge systems", "urban governance", "Urban observatories"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071046206", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"48462198800": {"Name": "Washbourne C.L.", "AuthorID": "48462198800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "36853249900": {"Name": "Blackstock J.J.", "AuthorID": "36853249900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "57189490183": {"Name": "Culwick C.", "AuthorID": "57189490183", "AffiliationID": "60000717, 60016218", "AffiliationName": "Gauteng City-Region Observatory, a partnership between the University of Johannesburg, The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Gauteng Provincial Government and organised local government in Gauteng"}, "57210582529": {"Name": "Moore R.", "AuthorID": "57210582529", "AffiliationID": "60000717, 60016218", "AffiliationName": "Gauteng City-Region Observatory, a partnership between the University of Johannesburg, The University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, Gauteng Provincial Government and organised local government in Gauteng"}, "26021005000": {"Name": "Acuto M.", "AuthorID": "26021005000", "AffiliationID": "60118504, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture, Building and Planning, University of Melbourne"}}}
