The present research analyses the links between energy efficiency improvements in households, consumption, and the economic structure in an input-output framework. We examine, from an empirical perspective, the relationship between energy efficiency improvements and the economic structure, and between the direct and the indirect rebound effect. The limits of the input-output methodology in assessing the direct and indirect rebound effect have been empirically tested with respect to efficiency improvements of electricity uses in households in Catalonia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy economics", "Energy efficiency", "Input-output analysis", "Rebound effect", "Structural analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983534964", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"35247902500": {"Name": "Freire-Gonz\u00e1lez J.", "AuthorID": "35247902500", "AffiliationID": "106208682", "AffiliationName": "ENT Environment and Management"}, "7801463360": {"Name": "Puig-Ventosa I.", "AuthorID": "7801463360", "AffiliationID": "106208682", "AffiliationName": "ENT Environment and Management"}, "55314376700": {"Name": "Font Vivanco D.", "AuthorID": "55314376700", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Center for Industrial Ecology, School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, Yale University"}}}
