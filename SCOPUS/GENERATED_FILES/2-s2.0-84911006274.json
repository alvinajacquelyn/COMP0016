Cancer", "Volume": "136", "Issue": 3, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 709, "PageEnd": 720, "CitedBy": 13, "DOI": "10.1002/ijc.29022", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84911006274&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 UICC.The aim of this study was to test the utility of AIMP3, an upstream regulator of DNA damage response following genotoxic stress, as a clinical biomarker in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). AIMP3 was identified from a meta-analysis of a global gene-expression dataset. AIMP3 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on a customised bladder cancer tissue-microarray (TMA). The mechanism of gene silencing was probed using methylation-specific PCR. The association between AIMP3 expression, Tp53 transactivity and genomic stability was analysed. In vitro AIMP3 translocation to the nucleus in response to ionising radiation was demonstrated using immunofluorescence. Radiosensitisation effects of siRNA-mediated AIMP3-knockdown were measured using colony forming assays. TMAs derived from patients enrolled in BCON, a Phase III multicentre radiotherapy trial in bladder cancer (ISRCTN45938399) were used to evaluate the association between AIMP3 expression and survival. The prognostic value of AIMP3 expression was determined in a TMA derived from patients treated by radical cystectomy. Loss of AIMP3 expression was frequent in MIBC and associated with impaired Tp53 transactivity and genomic instability. AIMP3-knockdown was associated with an increase in radioresistance. Loss of AIMP3 expression was associated with survival in MIBC patients following radiotherapy (HR=0.53; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.78, p = 0.002) but was not prognostic in the cystectomy set. In conclusion, AIMP3 expression is lost in a subset of bladder cancers and is significantly predictive of survival following radiotherapy in MIBC patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIMP3", "Biomarker", "Bladder cancer", "Organ-preservation", "Radiotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cystectomy", "Female", "Genes, p53", "Genes, Tumor Suppressor", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle, Smooth", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Peptide Elongation Factors", "Tissue Array Analysis", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911006274", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"25227346300": {"Name": "Gurung P.M.S.", "AuthorID": "25227346300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL Medical School, University College London (UCL)"}, "14008707100": {"Name": "Veerakumarasivam A.", "AuthorID": "14008707100", "AffiliationID": "60025577", "AffiliationName": "Genetic and Regenerative Medicine Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia"}, "8665309000": {"Name": "Williamson M.", "AuthorID": "8665309000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL Medical School, University College London (UCL)"}, "57201942956": {"Name": "Tan W.S.", "AuthorID": "57201942956", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL Medical School, University College London (UCL)"}, "6506954566": {"Name": "Feber A.", "AuthorID": "6506954566", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Cancer Biology, UCL"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, UCL Medical School, University College London (UCL)"}, "14422144300": {"Name": "Counsell N.", "AuthorID": "14422144300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, UCL Clinical Trials Centre"}, "57198819081": {"Name": "Douglas J.", "AuthorID": "57198819081", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60175923", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Centre, University of Southampton School of Medicine"}, "11739253300": {"Name": "Crabb S.J.", "AuthorID": "11739253300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Sciences Unit, University of Southampton"}, "7102838197": {"Name": "Short S.C.", "AuthorID": "7102838197", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, UCL"}, "34572458000": {"Name": "Powles T.", "AuthorID": "34572458000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Bart's Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "23137597600": {"Name": "Hoskin P.J.", "AuthorID": "23137597600", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "35480328200": {"Name": "West C.M.", "AuthorID": "35480328200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Manchester"}}}
