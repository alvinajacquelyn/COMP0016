Determining the true burden of typhoidal Salmonellae infections is hindered by lack of population-based studies and adequate laboratory diagnostics. The Strategic Typhoid alliance across Africa and Asia study takes a systematic approach to measuring the age-stratified burden of clinical and subclinical disease caused by typhoidal Salmonellae infections at three high-incidence urban sites in Africa and Asia. We aim to explore the natural history of Salmonella transmission in endemic settings, addressing key uncertainties relating to the epidemiology of enteric fever identified through mathematical models, and enabling optimisation of vaccine strategies. Methods/design: Using census-defined denominator populations of \u2265100 000 individuals at sites in Malawi, Bangladesh and Nepal, the primary outcome is to characterise the burden of enteric fever in these populations over a 24-month period. During passive surveillance, clinical and household data, and laboratory samples will be collected from febrile individuals. In parallel, healthcare utilisation and water, sanitation and hygiene surveys will be performed to characterise healthcare-seeking behaviour and assess potential routes of transmission. The rates of both undiagnosed and subclinical exposure to typhoidal Salmonellae (seroincidence), identification of chronic carriage and population seroprevalence of typhoid infection will be assessed through age-stratified serosurveys performed at each site. Secondary attack rates will be estimated among household contacts of acute enteric fever cases and possible chronic carriers. Ethics and dissemination: This protocol has been ethically approved by the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee, the icddr,b Institutional Review Board, the Malawian National Health Sciences Research Committee and College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee and Nepal Health Research Council. The study is being conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Informed consent was obtained before study enrolment. Results will be submitted to international peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Asia", "diagnosis", "enteric fever", "febrile illness", "healthcare utilisation", "infection transmission", "resource-limited setting", "salmonella paratyphi a", "salmonella typhi", "seroepidemiology", "serosurveillance", "vaccination programme"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Bangladesh", "Carrier State", "Censuses", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cost of Illness", "Female", "Health Resources", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Malawi", "Male", "Models, Theoretical", "Nepal", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Population Surveillance", "Research Design", "Seroepidemiologic Studies", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Typhoid Fever"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021725479", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"26027413200": {"Name": "Darton T.C.", "AuthorID": "26027413200", "AffiliationID": "60008750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, University of Sheffield Medical School"}, "57203188765": {"Name": "Baker S.", "AuthorID": "57203188765", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "57194712990": {"Name": "Meiring J.E.", "AuthorID": "57194712990", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6602544374": {"Name": "Tonks S.", "AuthorID": "6602544374", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7103193821": {"Name": "Pollard A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103193821", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "26663029900": {"Name": "Khan M.A.", "AuthorID": "26663029900", "AffiliationID": "60010123", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research"}, "25930852000": {"Name": "Khanam F.", "AuthorID": "25930852000", "AffiliationID": "60010123", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research"}, "7202170508": {"Name": "Clemens J.D.", "AuthorID": "7202170508", "AffiliationID": "60029270", "AffiliationName": "UCLA Fielding School of Public Health"}, "7005341667": {"Name": "Qadri F.", "AuthorID": "7005341667", "AffiliationID": "60010123", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research"}, "23010947700": {"Name": "Zaman K.", "AuthorID": "23010947700", "AffiliationID": "60010123", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research"}, "55777839700": {"Name": "Shakya M.", "AuthorID": "55777839700", "AffiliationID": "60138292", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Clinical Research Unit, Patan Academy of Health Sciences"}, "57203081912": {"Name": "Basnyat B.", "AuthorID": "57203081912", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, Centre for Tropical Medicine and Global Health, University of Oxford"}, "55358901500": {"Name": "Thindwa D.", "AuthorID": "55358901500", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7402800616": {"Name": "Gordon M.A.", "AuthorID": "7402800616", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "35784177100": {"Name": "Dolecek C.", "AuthorID": "35784177100", "AffiliationID": "60012718, 60175823", "AffiliationName": "Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit, Mahidol University"}, "7102366949": {"Name": "Dougan G.", "AuthorID": "7102366949", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "7003855751": {"Name": "Dunstan S.J.", "AuthorID": "7003855751", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340", "AffiliationName": "Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne"}, "35354639900": {"Name": "Holt K.E.", "AuthorID": "35354639900", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Melbourne"}, "34572310000": {"Name": "Pitzer V.E.", "AuthorID": "34572310000", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health, Yale University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
