Maintaining optimal bone health in children with CKD is important to prevent long-term complications, such as fractures, to optimise growth and possibly also to prevent extra-osseous calcification, especially vascular calcification. In this review, we discuss normal bone mineralisation, the pathophysiology of dysregulated homeostasis leading to mineralisation defects in CKD and its clinical consequences. Bone mineralisation is best assessed on bone histology and histomorphometry, but given the rarity with which this is performed, we present an overview of the tools available to clinicians to assess bone mineral density, including serum biomarkers and imaging such as dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and peripheral quantitative computed tomography. We discuss key studies that have used these techniques, their advantages and disadvantages in childhood CKD and their relationship to biomarkers and bone histomorphometry. Finally, we present recommendations from relevant guidelines\u2014Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes and the International Society of Clinical Densitometry\u2014on the use of imaging, biomarkers and bone biopsy in assessing bone mineral density. Given low-level evidence from most paediatric studies, bone imaging and histology remain largely research tools, and current clinical management is guided by serum calcium, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase levels only.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone biopsy", "Bone mineralisation", "Chronic kidney disease (CKD)", "Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)", "Peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068164727", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57190293841": {"Name": "Lalayiannis A.D.", "AuthorID": "57190293841", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Department Great Ormond St. Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "7004016103": {"Name": "Fewtrell M.", "AuthorID": "7004016103", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Department Great Ormond St. Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "57203337708": {"Name": "Biassoni L.", "AuthorID": "57203337708", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Department Great Ormond St. Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "22956754100": {"Name": "Shroff R.", "AuthorID": "22956754100", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Nephrology Department Great Ormond St. Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "6602674260": {"Name": "Crabtree N.J.", "AuthorID": "6602674260", "AffiliationID": "60170285", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7007173212": {"Name": "Milford D.V.", "AuthorID": "7007173212", "AffiliationID": "60170285", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006682534": {"Name": "Ferro C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006682534", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
