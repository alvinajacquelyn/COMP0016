KATP channels in vascular smooth muscle have a well-defined role in regulating vascular tone. KATP channels are also thought to be expressed in vascular endothelial cells, but their presence and function in this context are less clear. As a result, we aimed to investigate the molecular composition and physiological role of endothelial KATP channels. We first generated mice with an endothelial specific deletion of the channel subunit Kir6.1 (eKO) using cre-loxP technology. Data from qRT-PCR, patch clamp, ex vivo coronary perfusion Langendorff heart experiments, and endothelial cell Ca2 imaging comparing eKO and wild-type mice show that Kir6.1-contain-ing KATP channels are indeed present in vascular endothelium. An increase in intracellular [Ca2], which is central to changes in endothelial function such as mediator release, at least partly contributes to the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced by the KATP channel opener pinacidil. The absence of Kir6.1 did not elevate basal coronary perfusion pressure in eKO mice. However, vasorelaxation was impaired during hypoxia in the coronary circulation, and this resulted in greater cardiac injury during ischemia-reperfusion. The response to adenosine receptor stimulation was impaired in eKO mice in single cells in patch clamp recordings and in the intact coronary circulation. Our data support the existence of an endothelial KATP channel that contains Kir6.1, is involved in vascular reactivity in the coronary circulation, and has a protective role in ischemia reperfusion.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coronary perfusion pressure", "Functional characterization", "Ischemia reperfusion", "Molecular compositions", "Patch clamp recording", "Vascular endothelial cells", "Vascular endothelium", "Vascular smooth muscles", "Animals", "Calcium", "Calcium Signaling", "Coronary Circulation", "Endothelium, Vascular", "KATP Channels", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Vasodilation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032504586", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7004176082": {"Name": "Aziz Q.", "AuthorID": "7004176082", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Heart Centre, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56195067100": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56195067100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Heart Centre, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56810326600": {"Name": "Anderson N.", "AuthorID": "56810326600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Heart Centre, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57196279691": {"Name": "Ojake L.", "AuthorID": "57196279691", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Heart Centre, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36574509900": {"Name": "Tsisanova E.", "AuthorID": "36574509900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Heart Centre, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005427027": {"Name": "Tinker A.", "AuthorID": "7005427027", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Heart Centre, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
