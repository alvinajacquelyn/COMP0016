Objectives: The focus theme \u201cWearable Therapy\u201d aims to present contributions which target wearable and mobile technologies to support clinical and self-directed therapy. Methods: A call for papers was announced to all participants of the \u201c9th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare\u201d and was published in November 2015. A peer review process was conducted to select the papers for the focus theme. Results: Six papers were selected to be included in this focus theme. The paper topics cover a broad range including an approach to build a health informatics research program, a comprehensive literature review of self-quantification for health self-management, methods for affective state detection of informal care givers, social-aware handling of falls, smart shoes for supporting selfdirected therapy of alcohol addicts, and reference information model for pervasive health systems. Conclusions: More empirical evidence is needed that confirms sustainable effects of employing wearable and mobile technology for clinical and self-directed therapy. Inconsistencies between different conceptual approaches need to be revealed in order to enable more systematic investigations and comparisons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Health self-management", "Pervasive health", "Self-directed therapy", "Self-quantification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery of Health Care", "Gait", "Humans", "Medical Informatics", "Models, Theoretical", "Self Care", "Telemedicine", "Telemetry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009343285", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"6603173591": {"Name": "Arnrich B.", "AuthorID": "6603173591", "AffiliationID": "60005803", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University"}, "6701485879": {"Name": "Ersoy C.", "AuthorID": "6701485879", "AffiliationID": "60005803", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Engineering, Bogazici University"}, "24832374200": {"Name": "Mayora O.", "AuthorID": "24832374200", "AffiliationID": "60083112", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler"}, "7101701731": {"Name": "Dey A.", "AuthorID": "7101701731", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Human-Computer Interaction Institute, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "21743317500": {"Name": "Kunze K.", "AuthorID": "21743317500", "AffiliationID": "60025997", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Media Design, Keio University"}}}
