We aimed to investigate the impact of raising colonic propionate production on hepatic steatosis in adults with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Eighteen adults were randomized to receive 20 g/d of an inulin-propionate ester (IPE), designed to deliver propionate to the colon, or an inulin control for 42 days in a parallel design. The change in intrahepatocellular lipid (IHCL) following the supplementation period was not different between the groups (P = 0.082), however, IHCL significantly increased within the inulin-control group (20.9% \u00b1 2.9% to 26.8% \u00b1 3.9%; P = 0.012; n = 9), which was not observed within the IPE group (22.6% \u00b1 6.9% to 23.5% \u00b1 6.8%; P = 0.635; n = 9). The predominant SCFA from colonic fermentation of inulin is acetate, which, in a background of NAFLD and a hepatic metabolic profile that promotes fat accretion, may provide surplus lipogenic substrate to the liver. The increased colonic delivery of propionate from IPE appears to attenuate this acetate-mediated increase in IHCL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical trial", "dietary intervention", "fatty liver", "insulin resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Dietary Supplements", "Esters", "Fatty Acids, Volatile", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Humans", "Inulin", "Lipid Metabolism", "Liver", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Propionates", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053476554", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"24801868000": {"Name": "Chambers E.S.", "AuthorID": "24801868000", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section for Nutrition Research, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "56672456700": {"Name": "Byrne C.S.", "AuthorID": "56672456700", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section for Nutrition Research, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "57203899456": {"Name": "Rugyendo A.", "AuthorID": "57203899456", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section for Nutrition Research, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7101778601": {"Name": "Frost G.", "AuthorID": "7101778601", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Section for Nutrition Research, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7402118608": {"Name": "Morrison D.J.", "AuthorID": "7402118608", "AffiliationID": "60017641, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Stable Isotope Biochemistry Laboratory, Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, University of Glasgow"}, "7101928902": {"Name": "Preston T.", "AuthorID": "7101928902", "AffiliationID": "60017641, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Stable Isotope Biochemistry Laboratory, Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre, University of Glasgow"}, "6505827519": {"Name": "Tedford C.", "AuthorID": "6505827519", "AffiliationID": "60097343", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, University of the West of Scotland"}, "7404446013": {"Name": "Bell J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404446013", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Research Centre for Optimal Health, University of Westminster"}, "14120515900": {"Name": "Thomas L.", "AuthorID": "14120515900", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, Research Centre for Optimal Health, University of Westminster"}, "7006856048": {"Name": "Akbar A.N.", "AuthorID": "7006856048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "26423855300": {"Name": "Riddell N.E.", "AuthorID": "26423855300", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "56434950800": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "56434950800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7003963897": {"Name": "Thursz M.R.", "AuthorID": "7003963897", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "16744202500": {"Name": "Manousou P.", "AuthorID": "16744202500", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College NHS Trust"}}}
