Data on bariatric surgery for adolescents with severe obesity are extremely limited, with no evidence on cost-effectiveness. We evaluated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery compared with no surgery in adolescents with severe obesity from the UK's National Health Service perspective. Eighteen adolescents with body mass index \u226540 kg m-2 who underwent bariatric surgery (laparoscopic Roux en Y Gastric Bypass [RYGB] [N = 9], and laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy [SG] [N = 9]) at University College London Hospitals between January 2008 and December 2013 were included. We used a Markov cohort model to compare the lifetime expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between bariatric surgery and no surgery. Mean cost of RYGB and SG procedures were \u00a37100 and \u00a37312, respectively. For RYGB vs. no surgery, the incremental cost/QALY was \u00a32018 (95% CI \u00a31942 - \u00a32042) for males and \u00a32005 (95% CI \u00a31974 - \u00a32031) for females. For SG vs. no surgery, the incremental cost/QALY was \u00a31978 (95% CI \u00a31954 - \u00a32002) for males and \u00a31941 (95% CI \u00a31915 - \u00a31969) for females. Bariatric surgery in adolescents with severe obesity is cost-effective; it is more costly than no surgery however it markedly improved quality of life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent obesity", "bariatric surgery", "cost-effectiveness", "QALY"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Health", "Body Mass Index", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Female", "Gastrectomy", "Gastric Bypass", "Humans", "Male", "Obesity, Morbid", "Quality of Life", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052488277", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"57205708660": {"Name": "Panca M.", "AuthorID": "57205708660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care & Population Health, UCL Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care"}, "7005899067": {"Name": "Viner R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005899067", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy & Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "35197136000": {"Name": "White B.", "AuthorID": "35197136000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Adolescent Diabetes & Obesity, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57203623902": {"Name": "Pandya T.", "AuthorID": "57203623902", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203617599": {"Name": "Melo H.", "AuthorID": "57203617599", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "42561116100": {"Name": "Adamo M.", "AuthorID": "42561116100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102638286": {"Name": "Christie D.", "AuthorID": "7102638286", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004418512": {"Name": "Batterham R.", "AuthorID": "7004418512", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research, UCLH Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6603836017": {"Name": "Kinra S.", "AuthorID": "6603836017", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, UCL Institute of Epidemiology & Health Care"}}}
