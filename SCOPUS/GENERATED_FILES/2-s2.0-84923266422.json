It has been proposed that this is due to a general inability to integrate visual information at a global level. To test this theory, we assessed the performance of people with schizophrenia on a battery of tasks designed to probe voluntary averaging in different visual domains. Twenty-three outpatients with schizophrenia (mean age: 40\u00b18 years; 3 female) and 20 age-matched control participants (mean age 39\u00b19 years; 3 female) performed a motion coherence task and three equivalent noise (averaging) tasks, the latter allowing independent quantification of local and global limits on visual processing of motion, orientation and size. All performance measures were indistinguishable between the two groups (ps>0.05, one-way ANCOVAs), with one exception: participants with schizophrenia pooled fewer estimates of local orientation than controls when estimating average orientation (p = 0.01, one-way ANCOVA). These data do not support the notion of a generalised visual integration deficit in schizophrenia. Instead, they suggest that distinct visual dimensions are differentially affected in schizophrenia, with a specific impairment in the integration of visual orientation information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Form Perception", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motion Perception", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Orientation", "Schizophrenia", "Schizophrenic Psychology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923266422", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"10143727100": {"Name": "Tibber M.S.", "AuthorID": "10143727100", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "23003667100": {"Name": "Anderson E.J.", "AuthorID": "23003667100", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}, "57169850500": {"Name": "Bobin T.", "AuthorID": "57169850500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "35433190700": {"Name": "Shergill S.S.", "AuthorID": "35433190700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57203168890": {"Name": "Carlin P.", "AuthorID": "57203168890", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Science, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7004755048": {"Name": "Dakin S.C.", "AuthorID": "7004755048", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Optometry and Vision Science, University of Auckland"}}}
