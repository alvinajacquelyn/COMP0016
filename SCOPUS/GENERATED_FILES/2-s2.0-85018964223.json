Though there is a place in biology for both systemic and atomistic modes of explanation, for those with a theological perspective the shift to complex explanations in biology is often welcome. It suggests a more subtle view of divine action in which God's purposes are affected through engagement with the complex systems of creation rather than by discrete interventions. It also invites us to connect the biological interdependence with the interdependence in the nature and purposes of God, and it is consonant with a mystical vision of the unity of all things.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deterministic", "holistic", "interdependence", "mechanistic", "organismal", "reductionist", "systems biology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018964223", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"]], "AuthorData": {"9434781300": {"Name": "Watts F.", "AuthorID": "9434781300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "7202205455": {"Name": "Reiss M.J.", "AuthorID": "7202205455", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
