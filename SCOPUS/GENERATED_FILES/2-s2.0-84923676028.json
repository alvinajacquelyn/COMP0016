We engineered smokers' prior beliefs about the presence of nicotine in a cigarette smoked before a functional magnetic resonance imaging session where subjects carried out a sequential choice task. Using a model-based approach, we show that smokers' beliefs about nicotine specifically modulated learning signals (value and reward prediction error) defined by a computational model of mesolimbic dopamine systems. Belief of \"no nicotine in cigarette\" (compared with \"nicotine in cigarette\") strongly diminished neural responses in the striatum to value and reward prediction errors and reduced the impact of both on smokers' choices. These effects of belief could not be explained by global changes in visual attention and were specific to value and reward prediction errors. Thus, by modulating the expression of computationally explicit signals important for valuation and choice, beliefs can override the physical presence of a potent neuroactive compound like nicotine. These selective effects of belief demonstrate that belief can modulate modelbased parameters important for learning. The implications of these findings may be far ranging because belief-dependent effects on learning signals could impact a host of other behaviors in addiction as well as in other mental health problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Belief", "Dopamine", "FMRI", "Nicotine addiction", "Reinforcement learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attention", "Choice Behavior", "Culture", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurons", "Nicotine", "Placebos", "Reward", "Smoking", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923676028", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"16232881500": {"Name": "Gu X.", "AuthorID": "16232881500", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Human Neuroimaging Laboratory, Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute"}, "7004572764": {"Name": "Montague P.R.", "AuthorID": "7004572764", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"}, "6506984553": {"Name": "Lohrenz T.", "AuthorID": "6506984553", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Human Neuroimaging Laboratory, Virginia Tech Carilion Research Institute"}, "7005039618": {"Name": "Salas R.", "AuthorID": "7005039618", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "7006212812": {"Name": "Baldwin P.R.", "AuthorID": "7006212812", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Menninger Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "12801819500": {"Name": "Soltani A.", "AuthorID": "12801819500", "AffiliationID": "60010756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College"}, "24765108300": {"Name": "Kirk U.", "AuthorID": "24765108300", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark"}, "7003557687": {"Name": "Cinciripini P.M.", "AuthorID": "7003557687", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Departmentof Behavioral Science, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}}}
