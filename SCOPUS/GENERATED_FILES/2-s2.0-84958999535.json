Synthesis parameters such as film thickness and annealing temperatures and durations were investigated to optimize the PEC performance. A band gap of \u223c2.3 eV and a flat band potential of 0.5 V vs. RHE make Fe2V4O13 a promising photoanode material. Water oxidation was kinetically limited at the surface of Fe2V4O13 film as confirmed by tests in electrolyte with a hole scavenger (Na2SO3). Improved PEC performance was achieved by Mo and W doping because of enhanced carrier densities. The best performance was obtained by 2.5% W-doped Fe2V4O13 films (actual 0.8% W-doped), which efficiently oxidize water to O2via photogenerated holes as confirmed by oxygen evolution measurements. Moreover, the Fe2V4O13 photoanode displayed very stable photocurrent under illumination. Due to the suitable band gap and valence band position, Fe2V4O13 is a promising photoanode for solar water splitting. Co-catalyst loading and doping optimization are identified as routes to improve this material's performance further.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Annealing temperatures", "Ion layer adsorption", "Photoanode materials", "Photoelectrochemical water oxidation", "Photoelectrochemicals", "Photogenerated holes", "Solar water splitting", "Synthesis parameters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958999535", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"39561541500": {"Name": "Tang D.", "AuthorID": "39561541500", "AffiliationID": "60017060", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University"}, "55201215900": {"Name": "Rettie A.", "AuthorID": "55201215900", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering and Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin"}, "54897969900": {"Name": "Mabayoje O.", "AuthorID": "54897969900", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering and Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57053259000": {"Name": "Wygant B.", "AuthorID": "57053259000", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering and Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin"}, "55234573000": {"Name": "Mullins C.", "AuthorID": "55234573000", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "McKetta Department of Chemical Engineering and Department of Chemistry, University of Texas at Austin"}, "8591486200": {"Name": "Lai Y.", "AuthorID": "8591486200", "AffiliationID": "60017060", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University"}, "23097551000": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "23097551000", "AffiliationID": "60017060", "AffiliationName": "School of Metallurgy and Environment, Central South University"}}}
