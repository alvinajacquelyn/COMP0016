Experiments were carried out at near-freezing temperature and two different pH conditions (pH 13.4 and 9.0). At each pH condition, solutions having different concentrations of CaCl2 and NaHCO3 were mixed to achieve Ca/CO3 ratios of 1:1 and 10:1 at different pumping rates with and without phosphate. Results showed that, at pH 13.4, only ikaite was formed, independent of pumping rate, Ca/CO3 ratio, and phosphate. At pH 9.0, the precipitate was predominantly vaterite in the absence of phosphate and ikaite in the presence of phosphate regardless of the ratio of Ca/CO3. These results indicate that at low temperatures and moderate alkaline conditions (pH 9.0), phosphate can act as a switch between ikaite and vaterite polymorphs. Contrastingly, at higher alkaline conditions (pH 13.4) phosphate is not prerequisite and the high pH in itself is enough to trigger ikaite formation over vaterite.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline conditions", "Calcium carbonate polymorphs", "Effect of pH", "Freezing temperatures", "Low temperatures", "pH condition", "Pumping rate", "Vaterite"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926288301", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55822909000": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "55822909000", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz, Zentrum f\u00fcr Polar- und Meeresforschung"}, "6701350155": {"Name": "Wolf-Gladrow D.", "AuthorID": "6701350155", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "University of Bremen"}, "11141559100": {"Name": "Nehrke G.", "AuthorID": "11141559100", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred-Wegener-Institut Helmholtz, Zentrum f\u00fcr Polar- und Meeresforschung"}, "6507249158": {"Name": "Wolthers M.", "AuthorID": "6507249158", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences-Geochemistry, Utrecht University"}}}
