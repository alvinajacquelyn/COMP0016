Based on interatomic potential calculations of configurations containing up to two heteroatoms per cell, we parameterize an atomistic effective Hamiltonian to describe the energy of multiple substitutions, with consideration of both short- and long-range interactions. Then, the effective Hamiltonian is used to explore the full configurational space at other compositions, allowing the identification of the most stable structures for further analysis. We illustrate our approach with the aluminogermanate PKU-9, where we show that increasing the aluminium concentration changes the likely siting of Al, in agreement with experiment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049655757", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57202871965": {"Name": "Arce-Molina J.", "AuthorID": "57202871965", "AffiliationID": "120951712", "AffiliationName": "Dept.
