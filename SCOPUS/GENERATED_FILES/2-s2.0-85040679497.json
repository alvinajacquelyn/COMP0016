Journal of Industrial Ecology, published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc., on behalf of Yale University.Environmentally extended multiregional input-output (EE MRIO) tables have emerged as a key framework to provide a comprehensive description of the global economy and analyze its effects on the environment. Of the available EE MRIO databases, EXIOBASE stands out as a database compatible with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) with a high sectorial detail matched with multiple social and environmental satellite accounts. In this paper, we present the latest developments realized with EXIOBASE 3\u2014a time series of EE MRIO tables ranging from 1995 to 2011 for 44 countries (28 EU member plus 16 major economies) and five rest of the world regions. EXIOBASE 3 builds upon the previous versions of EXIOBASE by using rectangular supply-use tables (SUTs) in a 163 industry by 200 products classification as the main building blocks. In order to capture structural changes, economic developments, as reported by national statistical agencies, were imposed on the available, disaggregated SUTs from EXIOBASE 2. These initial estimates were further refined by incorporating detailed data on energy, agricultural production, resource extraction, and bilateral trade. EXIOBASE 3 inherits the high level of environmental stressor detail from its precursor, with further improvement in the level of detail for resource extraction. To account for the expansion of the European Union (EU), EXIOBASE 3 was developed with the full EU28 country set (including the new member state Croatia). EXIOBASE 3 provides a unique tool for analyzing the dynamics of environmental pressures of economic activities over time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consumption-based accounting", "EE MRIO analysis", "environmental-economic accounting", "EXIOBASE", "footprints", "industrial ecology"], "IndexKeywords": ["EE MRIO analysis", "Environmental economics", "EXIOBASE", "Footprints", "Industrial ecology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040679497", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"34972125100": {"Name": "Stadler K.", "AuthorID": "34972125100", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Ecology Programme, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)"}, "57196060442": {"Name": "Wood R.", "AuthorID": "57196060442", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Ecology Programme, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)"}, "57200296135": {"Name": "S\u00f6dersten C.", "AuthorID": "57200296135", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Ecology Programme, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)"}, "55660988300": {"Name": "Simas M.", "AuthorID": "55660988300", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Ecology Programme, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)"}, "57200299341": {"Name": "Schmidt S.", "AuthorID": "57200299341", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Ecology Programme, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)"}, "56509489800": {"Name": "Bulavskaya T.", "AuthorID": "56509489800", "AffiliationID": "60019984", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)"}, "36448320300": {"Name": "Kuenen J.", "AuthorID": "36448320300", "AffiliationID": "60019984", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO)"}, "55824074700": {"Name": "Usubiaga A.", "AuthorID": "55824074700", "AffiliationID": "118302104", "AffiliationName": "Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy"}, "56754729400": {"Name": "Acosta-Fern\u00e1ndez J.", "AuthorID": "56754729400", "AffiliationID": "118302104", "AffiliationName": "Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy"}, "36815709100": {"Name": "Bruckner M.", "AuthorID": "36815709100", "AffiliationID": "60000583", "AffiliationName": "Vienna University of Economics and Business\u2013Institute for Ecological Economics (WU)"}, "6603215164": {"Name": "Giljum S.", "AuthorID": "6603215164", "AffiliationID": "60000583", "AffiliationName": "Vienna University of Economics and Business\u2013Institute for Ecological Economics (WU)"}, "36816153600": {"Name": "Lutter S.", "AuthorID": "36816153600", "AffiliationID": "60000583", "AffiliationName": "Vienna University of Economics and Business\u2013Institute for Ecological Economics (WU)"}, "55599301900": {"Name": "Merciai S.", "AuthorID": "55599301900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "2.-0 LCA consultants"}, "20434526000": {"Name": "Schmidt J.", "AuthorID": "20434526000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "2.-0 LCA consultants"}, "56200820700": {"Name": "Theurl M.", "AuthorID": "56200820700", "AffiliationID": "60019660", "AffiliationName": "Alpen Adria University\u2013Institute of Social Ecology (UNI-KLU)"}, "6506917545": {"Name": "Plutzar C.", "AuthorID": "6506917545", "AffiliationID": "60019660", "AffiliationName": "Alpen Adria University\u2013Institute of Social Ecology (UNI-KLU)"}, "35172987400": {"Name": "Kastner T.", "AuthorID": "35172987400", "AffiliationID": "60116084", "AffiliationName": "Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (SBiK-F)"}, "8091682800": {"Name": "Eisenmenger N.", "AuthorID": "8091682800", "AffiliationID": "60019660", "AffiliationName": "Alpen Adria University\u2013Institute of Social Ecology (UNI-KLU)"}, "7007026767": {"Name": "Erb K.", "AuthorID": "7007026767", "AffiliationID": "60019660", "AffiliationName": "Alpen Adria University\u2013Institute of Social Ecology (UNI-KLU)"}, "7005690024": {"Name": "de Koning A.", "AuthorID": "7005690024", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML), Leiden University"}, "6701524162": {"Name": "Tukker A.", "AuthorID": "6701524162", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML), Leiden University"}}}
