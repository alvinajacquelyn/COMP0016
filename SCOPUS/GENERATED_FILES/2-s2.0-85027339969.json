Because the majority of individuals who carry HLA risk alleles do not develop hypersensitivity, other parameters must control development of the drug-specific T cell response. Thus, we have used a T cell-priming assay and nitroso sulfamethoxazole (SMX-NO) as a model Ag to investigate the activation of specific TCR Vb subtypes, the impact of programmed death-1 (PD-1), CTL-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), and T cell Ig and mucin domain protein-3 (TIM-3) coinhibitory signaling on activation of naive and memory T cells, and the ability of regulatory T cells (Tregs) to prevent responses. An expansion of the TCR repertoire was observed for nine Vb subtypes, whereas spectratyping revealed that SMX-NO-specific T cell responses are controlled by public TCRs present in all individuals alongside private TCR repertoires specific to each individual.We proceeded to evaluate the extent to which the activation of these TCR Vb-restricted Ag-specific T cell responses is governed by regulatory signals. Blockade of PD-L1/CTLA4 signaling dampened activation of SMX-NO-specific naive and memory T cells, whereas blockade of TIM-3 produced no effect. Programmed death-1, CTLA4, and TIM-3 displayed discrete expression profiles during drug-induced T cell activation, and expression of each receptor was enhanced on dividing T cells. Because these receptors are also expressed on Tregs, Treg-mediated suppression of SMX-NO-induced T cell activation was investigated. Tregs significantly dampened the priming of T cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that distinct TCR Vb subtypes, dysregulation of coinhibitory signaling pathways, and dysfunctional Tregs may influence predisposition to hypersensitivity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CTLA-4 Antigen", "Drug Hypersensitivity", "Haptens", "Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor", "Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta", "Sulfamethoxazole", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027339969", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57196748222": {"Name": "Gibson A.", "AuthorID": "57196748222", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "7103404706": {"Name": "Faulkner L.", "AuthorID": "7103404706", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "55257410000": {"Name": "Lichtenfels M.", "AuthorID": "55257410000", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "55389933200": {"Name": "Ogese M.", "AuthorID": "55389933200", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Sciences, Drug Safety and Metabolism, AstraZeneca Research and Development"}, "57194378833": {"Name": "Al-Attar Z.", "AuthorID": "57194378833", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "6508330042": {"Name": "Alfirevic A.", "AuthorID": "6508330042", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "7006669713": {"Name": "Pirmohamed M.", "AuthorID": "7006669713", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "35478124100": {"Name": "Park B.", "AuthorID": "35478124100", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "6603779088": {"Name": "Naisbitt D.", "AuthorID": "6603779088", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Research Council Centre for Drug Safety Science, University of Liverpool"}, "23468939700": {"Name": "Esser P.", "AuthorID": "23468939700", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg"}, "55349938700": {"Name": "Martin S.", "AuthorID": "55349938700", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Allergy Research Group, Department of Dermatology, Medical Center-University of Freiburg"}}}
