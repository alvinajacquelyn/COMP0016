This article reviews recent findings on the role of personality traits for psychological outcomes for carers of people with dementia.Recent findings: Several studies have now established that personality influences the caregiving experience, carer wellbeing and outcomes such as coping ability, burden and caregiving style. Several moderators of these associations have also been identified such as the effect of kinship and type of dementia. There is consistent evidence that carer personality characteristics influence the progression of the disease such as cognitive decline and severity. Most of the recent studies identified in this review are cross-sectional.Summary: Taken together, these results indicate that personality is an important psychological resource for carers. Recent findings indicate that personality traits are associated with and influence both carer and patient outcomes. Future research is necessary to guide interventions and to expand further on our understanding of how personality factors shape adjustment to the caregiving role and how these impact on the progression of the disease. \u00a9 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carers", "Dementia", "Extraversion", "Neuroticism", "Personality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Caregivers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dementia", "Disease Progression", "Humans", "Personality", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916593286", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"23397844800": {"Name": "Orgeta V.", "AuthorID": "23397844800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}, "56427480200": {"Name": "Leung P.", "AuthorID": "56427480200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychiatry"}}}
