In Saccharomyces cerevisiae G1/S gene expression is regulated by two transcription factor (TF) complexes, the MBF and SBF, which bind to specific DNA sequences, the MCB and SCB, respectively. Despite extensive research little is known regarding the evolution of the G1/S transcription regulation including the co-evolution of the DNA binding domains with their respective DNA binding sequences. We have recently examined the co-evolution of the G1/S TF specificity through the systematic generation and examination of chimeric Mbp1/Swi4 TFs containing different orthologue DNA binding domains in S. cerevisiae (Hendler et al. in PLoS Genet 13:e1006778. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1006778, 2017). Here, we review the co-evolution of G1/S transcriptional network and discuss the evolutionary dynamics and specificity of the MBF\u2013MCB and SBF\u2013SCB interactions in different fungal species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell cycle", "Evolution", "G1-to-S transition", "Gene expression", "MBF and SBF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Evolution", "Evolution, Molecular", "G1 Phase", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "S Phase", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic", "Yeasts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025810129", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57190664918": {"Name": "Hendler A.", "AuthorID": "57190664918", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences and the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "7006421966": {"Name": "Aharoni A.", "AuthorID": "7006421966", "AffiliationID": "60027161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences and the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev"}, "55616743700": {"Name": "Medina E.", "AuthorID": "55616743700", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, Duke University"}, "6602257094": {"Name": "Buchler N.", "AuthorID": "6602257094", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, Duke University"}, "7006222988": {"Name": "de Bruin R.", "AuthorID": "7006222988", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
