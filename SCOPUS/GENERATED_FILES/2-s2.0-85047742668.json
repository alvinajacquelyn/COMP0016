All Rights Reserved.Objectives Past studies have identified socioeconomic inequalities in the timing and route of labour market exit at older ages. However, few studies have compared these trends cross-nationally and existing evidence focuses on specific institutional outcomes (such as disability pension and sickness absence) in Nordic countries. We examined differences by education level and occupational grade in the risks of work exit and health-related work exit. Methods Prospective longitudinal data were drawn from seven studies (n=99 164). Participants were in paid work at least once around age 50. Labour market exit was derived based on reductions in working hours, changes in self-reported employment status or from administrative records. Health-related exit was ascertained by receipt of health-related benefit or pension or from the reported reason for stopping work. Cox regression models were estimated for each study, adjusted for baseline self-rated health and birth cohort. Results T here were 50 003 work exits during followup, of which an average of 14% (range 2-32%) were health related. Low level education and low occupational grade were associated with increased risks of healthrelated exit in most studies. Low level education and occupational grade were also associated with an increased risk of any exit from work, although with less consistency across studies. Conclusions Workers with low socioeconomic position have an increased risk of health-related exit from employment. Policies that extend working life may disadvantage such workers disproportionally, especially where institutional support for those exiting due to poor health is minimal.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Educational Status", "Employment", "Female", "Finland", "France", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occupations", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Retirement", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047742668", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56374126300": {"Name": "Carr E.", "AuthorID": "56374126300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56149457200": {"Name": "Fleischmann M.", "AuthorID": "56149457200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "36632716100": {"Name": "Murray E.T.", "AuthorID": "36632716100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57194344521": {"Name": "Xue B.", "AuthorID": "57194344521", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "24072448700": {"Name": "Zaninotto P.", "AuthorID": "24072448700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7202619429": {"Name": "Head J.", "AuthorID": "7202619429", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7404395870": {"Name": "Goldberg M.", "AuthorID": "7404395870", "AffiliationID": "60106188, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm, Population-based Epidemiologic Cohorts Unit-UMS 011"}, "7005528594": {"Name": "Zins M.", "AuthorID": "7005528594", "AffiliationID": "60106201, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM UMR 1168, VIMA"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "7005374676": {"Name": "Stafford M.", "AuthorID": "7005374676", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "55666438900": {"Name": "Stansfeld S.", "AuthorID": "55666438900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital"}}}
