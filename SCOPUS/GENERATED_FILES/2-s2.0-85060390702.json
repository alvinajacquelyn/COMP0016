The taxa represented are unidentified teleost fishes, lizards including a scincoid, unidentified birds and the theridomyid rodent Isoptychus. The scincoid represents the youngest record of the group in the UK. Of particular note is the taphonomic interpretation based on the preservation of anatomical parts of land-based tetrapods that would have been most likely transported to the site of deposition by wind, namely bird feathers and pieces of shed lizard skin. These comprise the majority of the specimens and suggest that the dominant transport mechanism was wind.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bembridge Marls", "bird", "feather", "fish", "lizard", "mammal", "rodent", "Scincoidea", "skin", "Squamata", "taphonomic", "Theridomyidae"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060390702", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"7005224791": {"Name": "Hooker J.J.", "AuthorID": "7005224791", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "57221028950": {"Name": "Evans S.E.", "AuthorID": "57221028950", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London, Anatomy Building"}, "57205534202": {"Name": "Davis P.G.", "AuthorID": "57205534202", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
