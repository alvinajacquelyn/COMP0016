All rights reserved.A 68-year-old woman presented 3 weeks following unsuccessful transcatheter radiofrequency ablation (TcRFA) for treatment of her chronic atrial fibrillation. Neurological signs manifested on day 2 of admission with generalised tonic-clonic seizures and reduced Glasgow Coma Score. She was treated for presumed central nervous system (CNS) infection, intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. CT of the head showed bilateral oedema secondary to acute embolic stroke. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, and lumbar puncture findings were consistent with CNS infection. Echocardiography showed only a septostomy puncture from the atrial fi brillation ablation procedure. Thoracic CT demonstrated air in the left atrium, consistent with the diagnosis of atrio-oesophageal fistula, a rarely reported iatrogenic complication of TcRFA. MRI of the head showed significant neurological injury with innumerable embolic infarcts. After discussion with her family regarding the significant neurological insult, and with no signs of any clinical improvement, the patient died on day 8 of admission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Catheter Ablation", "Esophageal Fistula", "Fatal Outcome", "Female", "Fistula", "Heart Atria", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921651638", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"38461286800": {"Name": "Moss C.E.", "AuthorID": "38461286800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of ICM/ Anaesthetics, UCLH"}, "36734984300": {"Name": "Walker D.", "AuthorID": "36734984300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of ICM/ Anaesthetics, UCLH"}, "55805340400": {"Name": "Fernandez-Caballero S.", "AuthorID": "55805340400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of ICM, UCLH"}}}
