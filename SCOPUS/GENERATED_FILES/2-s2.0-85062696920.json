All rights reserved.Mitochondria produce energy through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which depends on the expression of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). In metazoans, a striking exception from strictly maternal inheritance of mitochondria is doubly uniparental inheritance (DUI). This unique system involves the maintenance of two highly divergent mtDNAs (F- and M-type, 8 - 40% of nucleotide divergence) associated with gametes, and occasionally coexisting in somatic tissues. To address whether metabolic differences underlie this condition, we characterized the OXPHOS activity of oocytes, spermatozoa, and gills of different species through respirometry. DUI species express different gender-linked mitochondrial phenotypes in gametes and partly in somatic tissues. The M-phenotype is specific to sperm and entails (i) low coupled/uncoupled respiration rates, (ii) a limitation by the phosphorylation system, and (iii) a null excess capacity of the final oxidases, supporting a strong control over the upstream complexes. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a phenotype resulting from direct selection on sperm mitochondria. This metabolic remodelling suggests an adaptive value of mtDNA variations and we propose that bearing sex-linked mitochondria could assure the energetic requirements of different gametes, potentially linking male-energetic adaptation, mitotype preservation and inheritance, as well as resistance to both heteroplasmy and ageing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "Doubly uniparental inheritance", "Heteroplasmy", "Mito-nuclear coevolution", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative phosphorylation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bivalvia", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Female", "Gills", "Heredity", "Male", "Oocytes", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Spermatozoa"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062696920", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57194196866": {"Name": "Bettinazzi S.", "AuthorID": "57194196866", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Sciences Biologiques, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "57204342571": {"Name": "Breton S.", "AuthorID": "57204342571", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Sciences Biologiques, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "57195501960": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez E.", "AuthorID": "57195501960", "AffiliationID": "60004026", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Biologie, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec"}, "7102313720": {"Name": "Blier P.", "AuthorID": "7102313720", "AffiliationID": "60004026", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Biologie, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec"}, "22135824200": {"Name": "Milani L.", "AuthorID": "22135824200", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Biologiche, Geologiche e Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 di Bologna"}}}
