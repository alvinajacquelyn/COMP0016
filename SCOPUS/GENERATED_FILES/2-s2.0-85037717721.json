Indeed, the clinical presentation and pathophysiology of TTS clearly differ from cardiomyopathies, i.e. diseases of heart muscle unexplained by abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease, which cannot recover spontaneously and may cause sudden death often in minimally symptomatic individuals or result in a gradual deterioration in ventricular function and end-stage heart failure. Furthermore, the term \u2018cardiomyopathy\u2019 can no longer be applied when functional or morphologic abnormalities of the coronary arteries leading to acute myocardial ischemia are deemed responsible for left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. After 27 years of investigation, time has come to recognize that patients with TTS do suffer from severe myocardial ischemia and fulfill all criteria of acute coronary syndromes, i.e. acute chest pain, typical electrocardiographic changes, cardiac troponin rise, as well as LV wall motion abnormalities. Accordingly, we propose that TTS should be labeled as an acute \u2018syndrome\u2019 to be included more appropriately within the spectrum of ischemic heart disease. With regard to the term \u2018stress\u2019 it may imply that the catecholamine surge is essential to produce the typical transient myocardial injury. Thus, the terminology \u2018Takotsubo (stress) syndrome\u2019 would more accurately reflect recent advances in the pathophysiology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apical ballooning syndrome", "Catecholamine", "Coronary circulation", "Myocardial ischemia", "Stunning", "Takotsubo"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Coronary Syndrome", "Cardiomyopathies", "Electrocardiography", "Humans", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Societies, Medical", "Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037717721", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7005360685": {"Name": "Pelliccia F.", "AuthorID": "7005360685", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, Sapienza University"}, "7005062509": {"Name": "Sinagra G.", "AuthorID": "7005062509", "AffiliationID": "60001138", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Department, Azienda Sanitaria-Universitaria Integrata of Trieste \u2018ASUITS\u2019"}, "7202244843": {"Name": "Elliott P.", "AuthorID": "7202244843", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London and St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "55123441500": {"Name": "Parodi G.", "AuthorID": "55123441500", "AffiliationID": "60108815", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Interventional Cardiology, Sassari University Hospital"}, "7004539938": {"Name": "Basso C.", "AuthorID": "7004539938", "AffiliationID": "60000160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac, Thoracic and Vascular Sciences, University of Padua Medical School"}, "7005597818": {"Name": "Camici P.G.", "AuthorID": "7005597818", "AffiliationID": "60082964, 60009622", "AffiliationName": "Vita-Salute University and San Raffaele Hospital"}}}
