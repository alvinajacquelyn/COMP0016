MR safety must be maintained in the presence of a much wider variety of equipment than is found in a diagnostic unit, and of staff unfamiliar with the MRI environment, without compromising the safety and practicality of the interventional procedure. Both the MR-guided cardiac interventional unit at Kings College London and the intraoperative imaging suite at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery are single-room interventional facilities incorporating 1.5 T cylindrical-bore MRI scanners. The two units employ similar strategies to maintain MR safety, both in original design and day-to-day operational workflows, and between them over a decade of incident-free practice has been accumulated. This article outlines these strategies, highlighting both similarities and differences between the units, as well as some lessons learned and resulting procedural changes made in both units since installation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endovascular intervention", "Intraoperative imaging", "MRI", "Neurosurgery", "Safety"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Endovascular Procedures", "Great Britain", "Hospital Departments", "Hospital Design and Construction", "Humans", "London", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional", "Neurosurgery", "Patient Safety"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919338389", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35189849800": {"Name": "White M.J.", "AuthorID": "35189849800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35316314600": {"Name": "Thornton J.S.", "AuthorID": "35316314600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005286729": {"Name": "Kitchen N.", "AuthorID": "7005286729", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35722647600": {"Name": "Mancini L.", "AuthorID": "35722647600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.W.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57199166777": {"Name": "Wilson S.", "AuthorID": "57199166777", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Neuroradiology Department (Box 65)"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.J.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Image Computing"}, "57216093448": {"Name": "Hill D.L.G.", "AuthorID": "57216093448", "AffiliationID": "60112868", "AffiliationName": "IXICO"}, "13908270000": {"Name": "Razavi R.", "AuthorID": "13908270000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London"}, "6603701362": {"Name": "Keevil S.F.", "AuthorID": "6603701362", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Kings College London"}}}
