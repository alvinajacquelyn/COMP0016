This paper investigates high-fidelity synchronised multimodal recordings of small groups of learners interacting from diverse sensors that include computer vision, user generated content, and data from the learning objects (like physical computing components or laboratory equipment). We processed and extracted different aspects of the students' interactions to answer the following question: which features of student group work are good predictors of team success in open-ended tasks with physical computing? The answer to the question provides ways to automatically identify the students' performance during the learning activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collaborative learning", "Multimodal learning analytics", "practice-based learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collaborative learning", "Laboratory equipments", "Learning Activity", "Multi-modal learning", "Physical computing", "Practice-based learning", "Tools and techniques", "User-generated content"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030250567", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"24345016200": {"Name": "Spikol D.", "AuthorID": "24345016200", "AffiliationID": "60007905", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Computer Science, Malmo University"}, "15023001900": {"Name": "Ruffaldi E.", "AuthorID": "15023001900", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "PERCRO, Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "57191335532": {"Name": "Landolfi L.", "AuthorID": "57191335532", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "PERCRO, Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "56904209900": {"Name": "Cukurova M.", "AuthorID": "56904209900", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, University College London"}}}
