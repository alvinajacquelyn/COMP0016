We sought evidence for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) virological escape in patients on long-term PI monotherapy. Methods: We performed lumbar puncture in asymptomatic participants with suppressed plasma HIV RNA after 96 weeks on the PI monotherapy arm (PI-mono) of the PIVOT trial. We also report CSF HIV RNA concentration in trial participants who were investigated for neurological/ neurocognitive symptoms during the trial regardless of study arm allocation. Results: All 11 asymptomatic participants on PI-mono who were tested had undetectable CSF HIV RNA at week 96. One of the three symptomatic participants on PI-mono had CSF HIV RNA of 1,895 copies/ml (undetectable in plasma) and neither of two symptomatic participants on triple therapy had CSF HIV RNA detected. Conclusions: CSF virological escape appears rare in asymptomatic patients on PI monotherapy and may not warrant routine CSF monitoring, but patients with symptoms merit more concern.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Female", "HIV Infections", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "Humans", "RNA, Viral", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037058664", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6506318874": {"Name": "Arenas-Pinto A.", "AuthorID": "6506318874", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "8632775600": {"Name": "St\u00f6hr W.", "AuthorID": "8632775600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC-Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, UCL"}, "7101820336": {"Name": "Paton N.I.", "AuthorID": "7101820336", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "57206923926": {"Name": "Williams I.", "AuthorID": "57206923926", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "57207820760": {"Name": "Clarke A.", "AuthorID": "57207820760", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Lawson Unit, Brighton and Sussex University, Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7006669596": {"Name": "Beeching N.J.", "AuthorID": "7006669596", "AffiliationID": "60023925", "AffiliationName": "Tropical and Infectious Disease Unit, Royal Liverpool University Hospital"}, "55394254500": {"Name": "Minton J.", "AuthorID": "55394254500", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "Infection and Travel Medicine Services, St James\u2019 University Hospital"}, "11640357000": {"Name": "Lee V.", "AuthorID": "11640357000", "AffiliationID": "60030886", "AffiliationName": "Northern Sexual Health, Contraception and HIV Service, Royal Infirmary"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
