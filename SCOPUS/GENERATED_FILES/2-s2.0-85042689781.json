To investigate whether specific voices can modulate startle reactions and thereby predict speaker identification, we presented an audio hijack scenario to 84 participants and afterwards asked them to identify the perpetrator among neutral and negative speech fragments, while measuring flash-evoked eye-blink startle responses. Furthermore, we addressed data-driven cognitive processing during the audio scenario as a potential moderator in voice discrimination. Negative speech and the perpetrator's voice led to potentiated startle. Enhanced startle was positively associated with voice discrimination, but only in neutral speech fragments. In negative fragments, this association was weakened as a function of self-reported levels of data-driven processing during encoding. Thus, startle responses can generally predict accurate voice recognition, but speech emotionality and cognitive processing moderate this relationship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive processing style", "Skin conductance levels", "Speaker identification", "Startle reflex", "Traumatic memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Blinking", "Cognition", "Crime", "Emotions", "Fear", "Female", "Galvanic Skin Response", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Mental Recall", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Reflex, Startle", "Speech", "Voice", "Wounds and Injuries", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042689781", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"]], "AuthorData": {"57195754376": {"Name": "Schreuder M.", "AuthorID": "57195754376", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychological Science, Maastricht University"}, "37001921200": {"Name": "Meyer T.", "AuthorID": "37001921200", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, University of M\u00fcnster"}, "56051279500": {"Name": "Krix A.", "AuthorID": "56051279500", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychological Science, Maastricht University"}}}
