These may reflect the timing of growth events and characterise within-individual variability which can be modelled as a function of age. Subjects and methods: A Bayesian model is developed that includes random effects for the mean growth function, an individual age-alignment random effect and random effects for the within-individual variance function. This model is applied to data on boys\u2019 heights from the Edinburgh longitudinal growth study and to repeated weight measurements of a sample of pregnant women in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort. Results: The mean age at which the growth curves for individual boys are aligned is 11.4 years, corresponding to the mean \u2018take off\u2019 age for pubertal growth. The within-individual variance (standard deviation) is found to decrease from 0.24 cm2 (0.50 cm) at 9 years for the \u2018average\u2019 boy to 0.07 cm2 (0.25 cm) at 16 years. Change in weight during pregnancy can be characterised by regression splines with random effects that include a large woman-specific random effect for the within-individual variation, which is also correlated with overall weight and weight gain. Conclusions: The proposed model provides a useful extension to existing approaches, allowing considerable flexibility in describing within- and between-individual differences in growth patterns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children", "Heteroscedasticity", "multilevel model", "repeated measures", "variance model"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Bayes Theorem", "Child", "Child Development", "Female", "Growth and Development", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Models, Statistical", "Pregnancy", "Weight Gain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043685419", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"7203025236": {"Name": "Goldstein H.", "AuthorID": "7203025236", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Multilevel Modelling, University of Bristol"}, "16245377100": {"Name": "Leckie G.", "AuthorID": "16245377100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Multilevel Modelling, University of Bristol"}, "55445336900": {"Name": "Charlton C.", "AuthorID": "55445336900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Multilevel Modelling, University of Bristol"}, "7005983588": {"Name": "Browne W.", "AuthorID": "7005983588", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Multilevel Modelling, University of Bristol"}, "7004134399": {"Name": "Tilling K.", "AuthorID": "7004134399", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
