This study examined the contributions of reflective function concerning general attachment relationships, and specifically concerning trauma, as well as those of maternal attachment states of mind to the prediction of infant attachment disorganization in a sample of mothers with CA&N and their infants, using a 20-month follow-up design. Attachment and reflective functioning were assessed during pregnancy with the Adult Attachment Interview. Infant attachment was evaluated with the Strange Situation Procedure. The majority (83%) of infants of abused and neglected mothers were classified as insecure, and a significant proportion (44%) manifested attachment disorganization. There was a strong concordance between mother and child attachment, indicative of intergenerational transmission of attachment in parents with CA&N and their infants. Both unresolved trauma and trauma-specific reflective function made significant contributions to explaining variance in infant attachment disorganization. The findings of this study highlight the importance of trauma-specific mentalization in the intergenerational transmission of attachment by mothers with a history of childhood maltreatment, and provide new evidence of the importance of the absence of mentalization regarding trauma for infant attachment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child Abuse", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Longitudinal Studies", "Mother-Child Relations", "Mothers", "Object Attachment", "Pregnancy", "Theory of Mind", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925218110", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55778367100": {"Name": "Berthelot N.", "AuthorID": "55778367100", "AffiliationID": "60021501, 60009441", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Centre de Recherche de l'Institut Universitaire en Sant\u00e9 Mentale de Qu\u00e9bec, Center of Interdisciplinary Studies and Research on Child and Family Development"}, "14830901900": {"Name": "Ensink K.", "AuthorID": "14830901900", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Laval, Qu\u00e9bec, Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Intimate Relationship Problems and Sexual Abuse"}, "6602082923": {"Name": "Bernazzani O.", "AuthorID": "6602082923", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "6701813984": {"Name": "Normandin L.", "AuthorID": "6701813984", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Laval and Interdisciplinary Research Centre on Intimate Relationship Problems, Sexual Abuse"}, "57203069499": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "57203069499", "AffiliationID": "60025063, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, University College London"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Anna Freud Center"}}}
