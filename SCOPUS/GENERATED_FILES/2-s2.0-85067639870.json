The UEG Research Committee initiated a survey of the current and future research interests of each individual UEG ordinary member society (specialist societies). Methods: A questionnaire was sent by mail to 17 UEG ordinary member societies asking them to specify research demands related to the most urgent medical need including basic science research, translational research, clinical research, patient management research and research on disease prevention, in an open fashion but with limited word count. Results: The responses from 13 societies were analysed in a semi-quantitative and in a qualitative way, and were clustered into five domains with two aspects each that were consented and shared between three and seven of the responding 13 societies. These clusters resemble topics such as \u2018Hot topics\u2019 (e.g. life-style, nutrition, microbial-host interaction), Biomarkers (genetic profiling, gut-brain interaction), Advanced technology (artificial intelligence, personalised medicine), Global research tools (bio-banking, EU trials), and Medical training (education, prevention). Conclusion: The generated topic list allows both collaboration between individual specialist societies as well as initiating and fostering future research calls at the EU level and beyond when approaching stakeholders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["demand", "Gastroenterology", "questionnaire", "research", "specialist"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gastroenterology", "Humans", "Research", "Societies, Medical", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067639870", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"7005585406": {"Name": "Enck P.", "AuthorID": "7005585406", "AffiliationID": "60022653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine VI, University Hospital"}, "7003292073": {"Name": "Meisner S.", "AuthorID": "7003292073", "AffiliationID": "60017814", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev"}, "7006520927": {"Name": "Figueiredo C.", "AuthorID": "7006520927", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto"}, "6602542609": {"Name": "Mayerle J.", "AuthorID": "6602542609", "AffiliationID": "60000291", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine II, University Hospital"}, "55545862068": {"Name": "Ricciardiello L.", "AuthorID": "55545862068", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of Bologna"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
