Automated DR image assessment systems (ARIAS) may provide clinically effective and cost-effective detection of retinopathy. We aimed to determine whether ARIAS can be safely introduced into DR screening pathways to replace human graders. Design Observational measurement comparison study of human graders following a national screening program for DR versus ARIAS. Participants Retinal images from 20 258 consecutive patients attending routine annual diabetic eye screening between June 1, 2012, and November 4, 2013. Methods Retinal images were manually graded following a standard national protocol for DR screening and were processed by 3 ARIAS: iGradingM, Retmarker, and EyeArt. Discrepancies between manual grades and ARIAS results were sent to a reading center for arbitration. Main Outcome Measures Screening performance (sensitivity, false-positive rate) and diagnostic accuracy (95% confidence intervals of screening-performance measures) were determined. Economic analysis estimated the cost per appropriate screening outcome. Results Sensitivity point estimates (95% confidence intervals) of the ARIAS were as follows: EyeArt 94.7% (94.2%\u201395.2%) for any retinopathy, 93.8% (92.9%\u201394.6%) for referable retinopathy (human graded as either ungradable, maculopathy, preproliferative, or proliferative), 99.6% (97.0%\u201399.9%) for proliferative retinopathy; Retmarker 73.0% (72.0 %\u201374.0%) for any retinopathy, 85.0% (83.6%\u201386.2%) for referable retinopathy, 97.9% (94.9%\u201399.1%) for proliferative retinopathy. iGradingM classified all images as either having disease or being ungradable. EyeArt and Retmarker saved costs compared with manual grading both as a replacement for initial human grading and as a filter prior to primary human grading, although the latter approach was less cost-effective. Conclusions Retmarker and EyeArt systems achieved acceptable sensitivity for referable retinopathy when compared with that of human graders and had sufficient specificity to make them cost-effective alternatives to manual grading alone. ARIAS have the potential to reduce costs in developed-world health care economies and to aid delivery of DR screening in developing or remote health care settings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Decision Trees", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Economics, Medical", "False Negative Reactions", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Physical Examination", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009255599", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "26635526200": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "26635526200", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "University of Washington, Department of Ophthalmology"}, "57192713868": {"Name": "Louw V.", "AuthorID": "57192713868", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "12796147900": {"Name": "Liew G.", "AuthorID": "12796147900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "8384477700": {"Name": "Rudisill C.", "AuthorID": "8384477700", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Policy, LSE Health, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "37091551200": {"Name": "Salas-Vega S.", "AuthorID": "37091551200", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Policy, LSE Health, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "55337674700": {"Name": "Kapetanakis V.V.", "AuthorID": "55337674700", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}, "7202893034": {"Name": "Owen C.G.", "AuthorID": "7202893034", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}, "6603711082": {"Name": "Rudnicka A.R.", "AuthorID": "6603711082", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London, Cranmer Terrace"}, "55547123848": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55547123848", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital"}, "57163806000": {"Name": "Bolter L.", "AuthorID": "57163806000", "AffiliationID": "60005523", "AffiliationName": "Homerton University Hospital"}, "55850707300": {"Name": "Srinivas S.", "AuthorID": "55850707300", "AffiliationID": "60014349", "AffiliationName": "Doheny Eye Institute"}, "26026395800": {"Name": "Nittala M.", "AuthorID": "26026395800", "AffiliationID": "60014349", "AffiliationName": "Doheny Eye Institute"}, "6701477860": {"Name": "Sadda S.V.", "AuthorID": "6701477860", "AffiliationID": "60014349", "AffiliationName": "Doheny Eye Institute"}, "7404775085": {"Name": "Taylor P.", "AuthorID": "7404775085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Informatics and Multiprofessional Education, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
