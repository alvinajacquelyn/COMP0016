There has been an ever-growing interest in investigating these properties, driven by the desire to further miniaturize electronic devices, develop new functional materials and catalysts. Here, the intriguing question of how diffusion evolves in a single nanoparticle is investigated by measuring the spatial and temporal variations of the diffracted coherent X-ray intensity during copper diffusion into a gold nanocrystal. Dislocation loops formed from the insertion of single layer of extra atoms between neighbouring gold host lattice planes are detected. Au-Cu alloy channels are found to penetrate the nanocrystal due to the differential diffusion rate along different directions. With the advent of higher brilliance sources and free-electron-lasers, Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging can play an important role in unveiling atomic behaviours in three dimensions for nanomaterials during various fundamental processes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947224591", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57211734868": {"Name": "Xiong G.", "AuthorID": "57211734868", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "24597708500": {"Name": "Clark J.N.", "AuthorID": "24597708500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.K.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "7004232106": {"Name": "Nicklin C.", "AuthorID": "7004232106", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Campus"}, "6603289362": {"Name": "Rawle J.", "AuthorID": "6603289362", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Campus"}}}
