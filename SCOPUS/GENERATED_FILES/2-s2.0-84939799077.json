Saliva samples were taken from players (starting XV, n = 15, and nonstarters, n = 9) on a control day and 90 min before 4 games played consecutively at home and away venues against local rivals and league leaders. Precompetition psychological states were assessed using the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2. The squad recorded 2 wins (home) and 2 losses (away) over the study period. Calculated effect sizes (ESs) showed higher pregame cortisol- (C) and testosterone- (T) difference values before all games than on a baseline control day (ES 0.7-1.5). Similar findings were observed for cognitive and somatic anxiety. Small between-venues C differences were observed in starting XV players (ES 0.2-0.25). Conversely, lower home T- (ES 0.95) and higher away C- (ES 0.6) difference values were observed in nonstarters. Lower T-difference values were apparent in nonstarters (vs starting XV) before home games, providing evidence of a between-groups effect (ES 0.92). Findings show an anticipatory rise in psychophysiological variables before competition. Knowledge of starting status appears a moderating factor in the magnitude of player endocrine response between home and away games.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortisol", "Home advantage", "Hormones", "Psychophysiological", "Rugby", "Testosterone"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Anxiety", "Athletes", "Athletic Performance", "Cognition", "Competitive Behavior", "Football", "Humans", "Hydrocortisone", "Male", "Saliva", "Stress, Psychological", "Testosterone", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939799077", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"34871750100": {"Name": "Cunniffe B.", "AuthorID": "34871750100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Inst of Sport Exercise and Health, University College London"}, "7003493917": {"Name": "Cardinale M.", "AuthorID": "7003493917", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Inst of Sport Exercise and Health, University College London"}, "56797423200": {"Name": "Morgan K.", "AuthorID": "56797423200", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Sport, Health and Exercise Science, University of South Wales"}, "7402928433": {"Name": "Davies B.", "AuthorID": "7402928433", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Sport, Health and Exercise Science, University of South Wales"}, "35218763300": {"Name": "Baker J.", "AuthorID": "35218763300", "AffiliationID": "60097343", "AffiliationName": "Div of Sport and Exercise Science, University of the West of Scotland"}}}
