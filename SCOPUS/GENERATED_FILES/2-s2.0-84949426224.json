Methods: A pilot, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial was carried out with 44 older adults (83.9\u00b18.2 years) with shoulder dysfunction in 3 nursing homes in Toledo, Spain. Participants were recruited through information sessions and were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The control group (n = 22) intervention consisted of a physical therapy standard protocol proposed by the Spanish Rheumatology Society. Techniques based on Mulligan's concepts of mobilization with movement were added to the standard protocol for the experimental group (n = 22) intervention. Interventions took place 3 times a week for 2 consecutive weeks and were performed by 2 experienced therapists. Main outcomes were recruitment rates, participation and adherence to interventions, assessment procedures, and the implementation of mobilization with movement. Clinical outcomes were shoulder functionality, active glenohumeral range of motion, and pain intensity. Data were collected at baseline, after each group intervention, and at 1 and 3 months after finishing interventions. Results: All the participants accepted to be randomized. Participation rates were 97.7% for the experimental group and 95.5% for the control group. The analysis of variance did not show any statistically significant difference between treatment groups for any of the variables (all P values for the group effect were greater than .36) or a change of the difference between groups over time (all P values for the time-treatment interactions were greater than .3). Conclusion: The research methods tested in this pilot study offer a suitable foundation to conduct a full clinical trial.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disability evaluation", "Frail elderly", "Physical therapy modalities", "Shoulder"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949426224", "SubjectAreas": [["Chiropractics", "HEAL", "3602"]], "AuthorData": {"56996185400": {"Name": "Lirio Romero C.", "AuthorID": "56996185400", "AffiliationID": "116075886", "AffiliationName": "State Center of Attention to Brain Injury"}, "26428537000": {"Name": "Torres Lacomba M.", "AuthorID": "26428537000", "AffiliationID": "60027800", "AffiliationName": "University of Alcal\u00e1"}, "35778628300": {"Name": "Pacheco da Costa S.", "AuthorID": "35778628300", "AffiliationID": "60027800", "AffiliationName": "University of Alcal\u00e1"}, "56996170500": {"Name": "Castilla Montoro Y.", "AuthorID": "56996170500", "AffiliationID": "116075826", "AffiliationName": "Rio Riansares Nursing Home, Corral de Almaguer"}, "24478918700": {"Name": "Prieto Merino D.", "AuthorID": "24478918700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trial Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56996208300": {"Name": "Velasco Marchante M.", "AuthorID": "56996208300", "AffiliationID": "120005143", "AffiliationName": null}, "55781602600": {"Name": "Bodes Pardo G.", "AuthorID": "55781602600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
