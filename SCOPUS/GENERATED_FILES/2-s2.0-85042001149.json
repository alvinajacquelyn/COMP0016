Great focus has been given to the various approaches of fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) modeling. Currently, there has yet to be a single model that blends these modeling aspects together into one single formulation. In this article, the classification of models works by looking at their assumption in considering the phases inside the system. Researchers have been unraveling vast information to narrate in detail the relations between various variables that can be found in FBRs. Although it is not difficult to understand about the basics of modeling polymer properties, a gap exists for future researchers to justify in detail the phenomena and reduce the gap between model predictions and the actual data. The various controlling approaches to control these FBRs have also been reviewed and categorized depending on the method they used to control significant parameters of this nonlinear system. The progress that can be expected in this field leads to the creation of more efficient reactors and minimizing waste.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fluidization", "fluidized-bed reactors", "olefin polymerization", "process control", "process modeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Control approach", "Fluidized bed reactors", "Model prediction", "Modeling and control", "Modeling aspects", "Olefin polymerization", "Polymer properties", "Process Modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042001149", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57218355700": {"Name": "Abbasi M.R.", "AuthorID": "57218355700", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya"}, "35509977900": {"Name": "Hussain M.A.", "AuthorID": "35509977900", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya"}, "26654486300": {"Name": "Shamiri A.", "AuthorID": "26654486300", "AffiliationID": "60101841", "AffiliationName": "Chemical and Petroleum Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Technology and Built Environment, UCSI University"}}}
