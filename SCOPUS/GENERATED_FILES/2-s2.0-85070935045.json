In this review, we discuss the rationale for isolation of the pulmonary venous component of the left atrium to control AF. The review describes the embryologic origin of this component and makes the important distinction between the true posterior wall and the pulmonary venous component, which forms the dome of the left atrium. Studies that have examined the role of left atrial posterior wall isolation in AF ablation have loosely referred to the pulmonary venous component as the posterior wall. We critically reexamine this nomenclature and provide a sound argument underpinned by fundamental anatomic considerations, a clear understanding of which is critical to the operator. We discuss the various techniques used in isolating this region and review the outcome data of studies targeting this region in AF ablation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrial embryology", "Catheter ablation", "Left atrial anatomy", "Persistent atrial fibrillation", "Pulmonary venous component"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Catheter Ablation", "Heart Atria", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Pulmonary Veins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070935045", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57210568107": {"Name": "Elbatran A.I.", "AuthorID": "57210568107", "AffiliationID": "60016618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Ain Shams University"}, "12773877200": {"Name": "Saba M.M.", "AuthorID": "12773877200", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Clinical Academic Group, St. George's University of London"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "55455136800": {"Name": "Mori S.", "AuthorID": "55455136800", "AffiliationID": "60179043", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine"}}}
