In a previous article, we developed an analytic framework for examining the nature of mathematics and mathematical activity in textbooks in Palestinian schools and England. Here we extend our analysis to include the verbal/spoken language in two classrooms. To illustrate the application of the suggested framework, we present three cases from a particular social context (Palestine). We analyse an instance of a written textbook for grade 7 and spoken discourse in two classes in grades 5 and 6. We show how studying written and spoken discourse enables us to draw a picture of mathematics, mathematical activities and learning mathematics in schools context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Learner activity", "Nature of mathematics", "School mathematics", "Social semiotics", "Written and spoken discourse analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054679542", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"42961040000": {"Name": "Alshwaikh J.", "AuthorID": "42961040000", "AffiliationID": "60072735", "AffiliationName": "Curriculum and Instruction Department, Faculty of Education, Birzeit University"}, "8875006700": {"Name": "Morgan C.", "AuthorID": "8875006700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Curriculum Pedagogy and Assessment, University College London Institute of Education"}}}
