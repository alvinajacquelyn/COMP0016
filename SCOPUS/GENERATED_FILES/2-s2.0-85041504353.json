Here the molecular clutch model is extended to account for cell interactions with purely viscous surfaces (i.e., without an elastic component). Supported lipid bilayers present an idealized and controllable system throughwhich to study this concept. Using lipids of different diffusion coefficients, the mobility (i.e., surface viscosity) of the presented ligands (in this case RGD) was altered by an order of magnitude. Cell size and cytoskeletal organization were proportional to viscosity. Furthermore, there was a higher number of focal adhesions and a higher phosphorylation of FAK on less-mobile (more-viscous) surfaces. Actin retrograde flow, an indicator of the force exerted on surfaces, was also seen to be faster on more mobile surfaces. This has consequential effects on downstream molecules; the mechanosensitive YAP protein localized to the nucleus more on less-mobile (more-viscous) surfaces and differentiation of myoblast cells was enhanced on higher viscosity. This behavior was explained within the framework of the molecular clutch model, with lower viscosity leading to a low force loading rate, preventing the exposure of mechanosensitive proteins, and with a higher viscosity causing a higher force loading rate exposing these sites, activating downstream pathways. Consequently, the understanding of how viscosity (regardless of matrix stiffness) influences cell response adds a further tool to engineer materials that control cell behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell differentiation", "Matrix rigidity", "Mechanotransduction", "Molecular clutch", "Surface viscosity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actins", "Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Animals", "Cell Line", "Cell Shape", "Extracellular Matrix", "Fibronectins", "Focal Adhesion Kinase 1", "Focal Adhesions", "Lipid Bilayers", "Mice", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Myoblasts", "Oligopeptides", "Phosphatidylcholines", "Phosphoproteins", "Surface Properties", "Viscosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041504353", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57200904700": {"Name": "Bennett M.", "AuthorID": "57200904700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "26433165700": {"Name": "Cantini M.", "AuthorID": "26433165700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "25825387900": {"Name": "Reboud J.", "AuthorID": "25825387900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55154841200": {"Name": "Cooper J.", "AuthorID": "55154841200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "6602284406": {"Name": "Salmeron-Sanchez M.", "AuthorID": "6602284406", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "8926063400": {"Name": "Roca-Cusachs P.", "AuthorID": "8926063400", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine, University of Barcelona"}}}
