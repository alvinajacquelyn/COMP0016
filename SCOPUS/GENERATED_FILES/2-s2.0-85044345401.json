Previous work has examined stimulus detection at attended locations, but it is unknown whether unattended locations are also subject to phasic modulation by ongoing oscillatory activity, as would be predicted by theories proposing a role for neural oscillations in organizing general neural processing. Here, we recorded brain activity with EEG while human participants of both sexes detected brief visual targets preceded by a spatial cue and determined whether performance for cued (attended) and uncued (unattended) targets was influenced by oscillatory phase across a range of frequencies. Detection of both attended and unattended targets depended upon an ~5 Hz theta rhythm and an ~11\u201315 Hz alpha rhythm. Critically, detection of unattended stimuli was more strongly modulated by the phase of theta oscillations than was detection of attended stimuli, suggesting that attentional allocation involves a disengagement from ongoing theta sampling. There was no attention-related difference in the strength of alpha phase dependence, consistent with a perceptual rather than attentional role of oscillatory phase in this frequency range. These results demonstrate the importance of neural oscillations in modulating visual processing at both attended and unattended locations and clarify one way in which attention may produce its effects: through disengagement from low-frequency sampling at attended locations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha", "Attention", "Neural oscillations", "Perception", "Phase", "Theta"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Brain", "Cues", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044345401", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55750976000": {"Name": "Harris A.", "AuthorID": "55750976000", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland"}, "7005539263": {"Name": "Mattingley J.", "AuthorID": "7005539263", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, The University of Queensland"}, "7004246809": {"Name": "Dux P.", "AuthorID": "7004246809", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, The University of Queensland"}}}
