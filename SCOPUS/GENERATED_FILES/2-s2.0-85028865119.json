In geographical terms, this has been organized through a number of strategic cities serving as gateways for the exchange of financial functions, products and practices between China and the global economy. Drawing on location data of financial service firms in China listed on stock exchanges in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Hong Kong, this paper shows that Chinese financial firms are expanding globally and how Chinese financial centers are positioned and connected in the urban networks shaped by these financial service firms. It is found that Hong Kong, China, holds strategic positions in the integration of Chinese cities into global financial center networks, and that establishing a foothold in global financial centers such as New York and London has been a priority for Chinese financial institutions. The increasing capital flows directed by Chinese financial institutions suggests a shifting global financial geography, with numerous Chinese cities playing increasingly important roles within global financial center networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "corporate networks", "financial service firms", "global financial centers", "urban networks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028865119", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"23478150200": {"Name": "Pan F.", "AuthorID": "23478150200", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University"}, "57195567043": {"Name": "He Z.", "AuthorID": "57195567043", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University"}, "55645748600": {"Name": "Sigler T.", "AuthorID": "55645748600", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Planning and Environmental Management, University of Queensland"}, "36504808800": {"Name": "Martinus K.", "AuthorID": "36504808800", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Western Australia"}, "6602665490": {"Name": "Derudder B.", "AuthorID": "6602665490", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Ghent University"}}}
