Fixed-effects panel-data methods that estimate the unobserved effects can be severely biased because of the incidental parameter problem (Neyman and Scott, 1948, Econometrica 16: 1\u201332). We tackle this problem using the analytical and jackknife bias corrections derived in Fern\u00e1ndez-Val and Weidner (2016, Journal of Econometrics 192: 291\u2013312) for panels where the two dimensions (N and T) are moderately large. We illustrate the commands with an empirical application to international trade and a Monte Carlo simulation calibrated to this application.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bias corrections", "Fixed effects", "Incidental parameter problem", "Logit", "Logitfe", "Panel", "Probit", "Probitfe", "St0485"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029859008", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"]], "AuthorData": {"57216258752": {"Name": "Cruz-Gonzalez M.", "AuthorID": "57216258752", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Boston University"}, "9337516200": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Val I.", "AuthorID": "9337516200", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Boston University"}, "55241495000": {"Name": "Weidner M.", "AuthorID": "55241495000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}}}
