Patients and Methods We obtained aggregate data on relapse and survival outcomes for 16,623 patients age 1 to 18 years old with newly diagnosed ALL treated between 1996 and 2007 by 10 cooperative study groups from around the world. The proportion of patients eligible for prophylactic CRT varied from 0%to 33% by trial and was not related to the proportion eligible for allogeneic stem-cell transplantation in first complete remission. Using a random effects model, with CRT as a dichotomous covariate, we performed a single-arm metaanalysis to compare event-free survival and cumulative incidence of isolated or any CNS relapse and isolated bone marrow relapse in high-risk subgroups of patients who either did or did not receive CRT. Results Although there was significant heterogeneity in all outcome end points according to trial, CRT was associated with a reduced risk of relapse only in the small subgroup of patients with overt CNS disease at diagnosis, who had a significantly lower risk of isolated CNS relapse (4% with CRT v 17% without CRT; P = .02) and a trend toward lower risk of any CNS relapse (7% with CRT v 17% without CRT; P = .09). However, this group had a relatively high rate of events regardless of whether or not they received CRT (32% [95% CI, 26% to 39%] v 34% [95% CI, 19% to 54%]; P = .8). Conclusion CRT does not have an impact on the risk of relapse in children with ALL treated on contemporary protocols.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cranial Irradiation", "Humans", "Infant", "Linear Models", "Methotrexate", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Retrospective Studies", "Secondary Prevention", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962163261", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"35430808700": {"Name": "Vora A.", "AuthorID": "35430808700", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60002869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology, Sheffield Children's Hospital, University of Sheffield"}, "7003968157": {"Name": "Goulden N.", "AuthorID": "7003968157", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "25633771200": {"Name": "Andreano A.", "AuthorID": "25633771200", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "7006062441": {"Name": "Valsecchi M.G.", "AuthorID": "7006062441", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "57195588807": {"Name": "Biondi A.", "AuthorID": "57195588807", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "7202821559": {"Name": "Locatelli F.", "AuthorID": "7202821559", "AffiliationID": "60015197, 60017905", "AffiliationName": "Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital, University of Pavia"}, "57203044347": {"Name": "Pui C.H.", "AuthorID": "57203044347", "AffiliationID": "60002194, 60019905", "AffiliationName": "St Jude Children's Research Hospital, University of Tennessee Health Science Center"}, "7003412276": {"Name": "Hunger S.P.", "AuthorID": "7003412276", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60030118", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}, "35376328400": {"Name": "Silverman L.B.", "AuthorID": "35376328400", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "6602100644": {"Name": "Devidas M.", "AuthorID": "6602100644", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Group Statistics and Data Center, University of Florida"}, "56881744500": {"Name": "Schrappe M.", "AuthorID": "56881744500", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre, Christian-Albrechts-University"}, "23668741500": {"Name": "Moericke A.", "AuthorID": "23668741500", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre, Christian-Albrechts-University"}, "8632950200": {"Name": "Escherich G.", "AuthorID": "8632950200", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "7101640271": {"Name": "Taskinen M.", "AuthorID": "7101640271", "AffiliationID": "60016987", "AffiliationName": "Helsinki University Hospital"}, "7103039093": {"Name": "Pieters R.", "AuthorID": "7103039093", "AffiliationID": "112862917", "AffiliationName": "Princess M'axima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group"}, "35405768200": {"Name": "Horibe K.", "AuthorID": "35405768200", "AffiliationID": "60013010", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center"}}}
