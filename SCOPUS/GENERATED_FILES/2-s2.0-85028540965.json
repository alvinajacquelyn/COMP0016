This work proposes new system and receiver models and then investigates the employment of various forward error correction (FEC) techniques, as well as a new interference cancellation receiver architecture to improve the overall system performance by ameliorating the effects of inter-carrier interference (ICI). Results show that the use of coded SEFDM system can drastically increase the SE by up to 67% relative to OFDM, at the expense of a power penalty below 3dB.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular network", "Intercarrier interference", "Interference cancellation", "Multicarrier signal", "Power penalty", "Receiver architecture", "Receiver models", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028540965", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57151150900": {"Name": "Ghannam H.", "AuthorID": "57151150900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, University College London"}}}
