So far, most of them investigated energetic masking. The present study evaluated situations inducing mostly informational masking, which reflects cognitive interference induced by the masker. Dyslexic children were asked to identify a female target syllable presented in quiet, babble, unmodulated, and modulated speech-shaped noise. Whereas their performance was comparable to normal-reading children in quiet, it dropped significantly in all noisy conditions compared to age-, but not reading level-matched controls. Interestingly, noise affected similarly the reception of voicing, place, and manner of articulation in dyslexic and normal-reading children.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive interferences", "Energetic masking", "Informational masking", "Matched controls", "Noisy conditions", "Reading level", "Speech perception", "Speech-shaped noise", "Acoustic Stimulation", "Age Factors", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Cues", "Dyslexia", "Female", "Humans", "Literacy", "Male", "Noise", "Perceptual Masking", "Phonetics", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Speech Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930619327", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"55490024400": {"Name": "Calcus A.", "AuthorID": "55490024400", "AffiliationID": "60000145, 60070041", "AffiliationName": "Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique-FNRS (FRS-FNRS), Unit\u00e9 de Recherche en Neurosciences Cognitives (UNESCOG), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}, "57190358546": {"Name": "Kolinsky R.", "AuthorID": "57190358546", "AffiliationID": "60000145, 60070041", "AffiliationName": "Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique-FNRS (FRS-FNRS), Unit\u00e9 de Recherche en Neurosciences Cognitives (UNESCOG), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}, "7102035644": {"Name": "Colin C.", "AuthorID": "7102035644", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de Recherche en Neurosciences Cognitives (UNESCOG), Center for Research in Cognition and Neurosciences (CRCN), Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "7004387518": {"Name": "Deltenre P.", "AuthorID": "7004387518", "AffiliationID": "60033044", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Neurophysiologie Sensorielle et Cognitive, H\u00f4pital Brugmann"}}}
