Here, we studied the female neurogenomic response after only 10 min of mate exposure in both a sensory component (optic tectum) and a decision-making component (telencephalon) of the brain. By comparing the transcriptional response between females with and without preferences for colourful males, we identified unique neurogenomic elements associated with the female preference phenotype that are not present in females without preference. A network analysis revealed different properties for this response at the sensory-processing and the decision-making levels, and we show that this response is highly centralized in the telencephalon. Furthermore, we identified an additional set of genes that vary in expression across social contexts, beyond mate evaluation. We show that transcription factors among these loci are predicted to regulate the transcriptional response of the genes we found to be associated with female preference.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Decision Making", "Female", "Genome", "Mating Preference, Animal", "Poecilia", "Sensation", "Superior Colliculi", "Telencephalon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054603366", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"56511743100": {"Name": "Bloch N.", "AuthorID": "56511743100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6603493469": {"Name": "Mank J.", "AuthorID": "6603493469", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Organismal Biology, Uppsala University"}, "56544571100": {"Name": "Corral-L\u00f3pez A.", "AuthorID": "56544571100", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology/Ethology, Stockholm University"}, "36482417600": {"Name": "Buechel S.", "AuthorID": "36482417600", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology/Ethology, Stockholm University"}, "24401153000": {"Name": "Kotrschal A.", "AuthorID": "24401153000", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology/Ethology, Stockholm University"}, "6602955806": {"Name": "Kolm N.", "AuthorID": "6602955806", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology/Ethology, Stockholm University"}}}
