Objective To implement point-of-contact interactive record linkage (PIRL) between demographic and health facility systems data, characterise attributes associated with (un)successful record linkage, and compare findings with a fully automated retrospective linkage approach. Methods Individuals visiting the Kisesa Health Centre were matched to their HDSS records during a short up-take interview in the waiting area of the health facility. The search algorithm was used to rank potential matches, from which the true match(es) were selected after consultation with the patient. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify characteristics associated with being matched to an HDSS record. Records matched based on respondent\u2019s clarifications were subsequently used as the gold-standard to evaluate fully automated retrospective record linkage by calculating sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). Results Among 2,624 individuals who reportedly lived in the HDSS coverage area, we matched 2,206 (84.1%) to their HDSS records. Characteristics associated with a higher odds of being matched were increased age (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02, 1.12; per 5-year increment), a later consent into the study (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.37, 3.12; in the most recent six-month period), and fieldworker level of experience. The main drivers of the linkage algorithm were name, sex, year of birth, village, sub-village, and household member name. At the lowest match score threshold, automated retrospective linkage would have only correctly identified and linked 55% (1440/2612) of the records with a PPV of 55% (1440/2612). Conclusion Where resources are available, PIRL is a viable approach to link HDSS and other administrative data sources that outperforms purely retrospective approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data linkage", "Health and demographic surveillance systems", "Health facility", "Point-of-contact interactive record linkage", "Sub-Saharan Africa"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057904172", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"47562049000": {"Name": "Rentsch C.T.", "AuthorID": "47562049000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "26538211200": {"Name": "Reniers G.", "AuthorID": "26538211200", "AffiliationID": "60016218, 60028973", "AffiliationName": "MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt), School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "23010308400": {"Name": "Todd J.", "AuthorID": "23010308400", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "Tazama Project, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "7004308369": {"Name": "Zaba B.", "AuthorID": "7004308369", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55350313500": {"Name": "Kabudula C.", "AuthorID": "55350313500", "AffiliationID": "60016218, 60028973", "AffiliationName": "MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Research Unit (Agincourt), School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "56690462800": {"Name": "Machemba R.", "AuthorID": "56690462800", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "Tazama Project, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "55658368600": {"Name": "Mtenga B.", "AuthorID": "55658368600", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "Tazama Project, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "55811814200": {"Name": "Michael D.", "AuthorID": "55811814200", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "Tazama Project, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "6602814685": {"Name": "Urassa M.", "AuthorID": "6602814685", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "Tazama Project, National Institute for Medical Research"}, "55249873300": {"Name": "Harron K.", "AuthorID": "55249873300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "25225628500": {"Name": "Mee P.", "AuthorID": "25225628500", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "MeSH Consortium, Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57211287459": {"Name": "Natalis R.", "AuthorID": "57211287459", "AffiliationID": "124573038", "AffiliationName": null}}}
