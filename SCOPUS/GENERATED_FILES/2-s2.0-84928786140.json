To reduce signalling overhead under limited backhaul capacity, the authors make use of local long-term channel state information (CSI) in coordinated scheduling design. They first derive the ergodic rate expressions for both the single RAU transmission and the cooperative RAU transmission modes as functions of long-term CSI. Then greedy scheduling algorithms (GSAs) aiming for the maximum ergodic sum rate for the massive DAS using long-term CSI are proposed. To mitigate the intra-cell interference, a two-stage GSA with hybrid transmission mode is devised. Asymptotic analysis reveals that as the number of RAUs goes to infinity, intra-cell interference can be effectively mitigated. Simulation results verify the analysis and demonstrate that the two-stage GSA exhibits a higher ergodic sum-rate.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coordinated scheduling", "Distributed antenna system", "Greedy scheduling algorithms", "Hybrid transmissions", "Intra-cell interference", "Limited backhauls", "Scheduling problem", "Transmission mode"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928786140", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55231762300": {"Name": "Sun Q.", "AuthorID": "55231762300", "AffiliationID": "60021783", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nantong University"}, "56493254100": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56493254100", "AffiliationID": "60104290", "AffiliationName": "iTrust Research Center Temasek Laboratories, Singapore University of Technology and Design"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "55934284800": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55934284800", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "7403872378": {"Name": "Gao X.", "AuthorID": "7403872378", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
