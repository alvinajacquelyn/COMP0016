All rights reserved.Temporal system-mass-density fluctuation analysis was performed on liquid-water molecular-dynamics simulations at ambient pressure and 200 and 300 K, in three increasingly-large systems. A prominent mode in system-density fluctuations was observed at molecular-librational frequencies of \u223c600-800 cm-1 (with pronounced temperature dependence). This mode displayed marked system-size dependence, disappearing for larger systems. Persistent system-density fluctuations were clearly evident at 10-11 cm-1 for all systems and temperatures, with lower-amplitude \u00e2\u20ac'overtones' evident only in larger systems. It is conjectured that this reflects \u223c3 ps timescales observed in earlier studies for dissipation of local-density fluctuations in liquid water in this 200-300 K temperature range.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient pressures", "Density fluctuation", "Local density fluctuations", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "System size dependence", "Temperature dependence", "Temperature range", "Time-dependent density"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959420044", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56640992900": {"Name": "Waldron C.", "AuthorID": "56640992900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004765766": {"Name": "English N.", "AuthorID": "7004765766", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, University College Dublin"}}}
