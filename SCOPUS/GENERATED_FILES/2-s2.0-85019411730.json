Environmental decision-making has changed somewhat in recent decades to account for unintentional impacts on human wellbeing. The involvement of stakeholders in environmental projects has been recognised as critical for ensuring their success and equally for the syntheses of evidence of what works, where, and for whom, providing key benefits and challenges. As a result of increased interest in systematic reviews of complex management issues, there is a need for guidance in best practices for stakeholder engagement. Here, we propose a framework for stakeholder engagement in systematic reviews/systematic maps, highlighting recommendations and advice that are critical for effective, efficient and meaningful engagement of stakeholders. The discussion herein aims to provide a toolbox of stakeholder engagement activities, whilst also recommending approaches from stakeholder engagement research that may prove to be particularly useful for systematic reviews and systematic maps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Best practice", "Communication", "Conflict resolution", "Dissemination", "Methodology", "Stakeholder analysis", "Stakeholders"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019411730", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"54997981700": {"Name": "Haddaway N.R.", "AuthorID": "54997981700", "AffiliationID": "60015157", "AffiliationName": "Mistra EviEM, Stockholm Environment Institute"}, "56400520300": {"Name": "Kohl C.", "AuthorID": "56400520300", "AffiliationID": "60171641", "AffiliationName": "Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants, Julius K\u00fchn-Institut (JKI)"}, "55356263500": {"Name": "Schiemann J.", "AuthorID": "55356263500", "AffiliationID": "60171641", "AffiliationName": "Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants, Julius K\u00fchn-Institut (JKI)"}, "15726478800": {"Name": "Wilhelm R.", "AuthorID": "15726478800", "AffiliationID": "60171641", "AffiliationName": "Federal Research Centre for Cultivated Plants, Julius K\u00fchn-Institut (JKI)"}, "56008314700": {"Name": "Rebelo Da Silva N.", "AuthorID": "56008314700", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "CEE jo'Burg, Centre for Anthropological Research (CfAR), University of Johannesburg"}, "8604870700": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "8604870700", "AffiliationID": "60000717", "AffiliationName": "CEE jo'Burg, Centre for Anthropological Research (CfAR), University of Johannesburg"}, "15766114900": {"Name": "Sp\u00f6k A.", "AuthorID": "15766114900", "AffiliationID": "60019660", "AffiliationName": "Alpen-Adria Universit\u00e4t Klagenfurt Wien Graz, IFZ-Inter-University, Research Centre for Technology Work and Culture"}, "55699227800": {"Name": "Sweet J.B.", "AuthorID": "55699227800", "AffiliationID": "118496737", "AffiliationName": "JT Environmental Consultants (JTEC)"}}}
