We investigated the role of the NKG2D axis in T cell/NK cell interactions in hepatitis B. Activated and hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific T cells, particularly the CD4 fraction, expressed NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), which were not found on T cells from healthy controls (p < 0.001). NKG2DL-expressing T cells were strikingly enriched within HBV-infected livers compared with the periphery or to healthy livers (p < 0.001). NKG2D+NK cells were also increased and preferentially activated in the HBVinfected liver (p < 0.001), in direct proportion to the percentage of MICA/B-expressing CD4 T cells colocated within freshly isolated liver tissue (p < 0.001). This suggests that NKG2DL induced on T cells within a diseased organ can calibrate NKG2D dependent activation of local NK cells; furthermore, NKG2D blockade could rescue HBV-specific and MICA/B-expressing T cells from HBV-infected livers. To our knowledge, this is the first ex vivo demonstration that non-virally infected human T cells can express NKG2DL, with implications for stress surveillance by the large number of NKG2D-expressing NK cells sequestered in the liver.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Communication", "Cells, Cultured", "Female", "Hepatitis B, Chronic", "Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Ligands", "Liver", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014664079", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57193530732": {"Name": "Huang W.C.", "AuthorID": "57193530732", "AffiliationID": "60011828, 60004965", "AffiliationName": "Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center"}, "6507453984": {"Name": "Easom N.J.", "AuthorID": "6507453984", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "55631910900": {"Name": "Tang X.Z.", "AuthorID": "55631910900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "56290146100": {"Name": "Singh H.", "AuthorID": "56290146100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "24171517900": {"Name": "Peppa D.", "AuthorID": "24171517900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "7003333032": {"Name": "Maini M.K.", "AuthorID": "7003333032", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Rayne Building"}, "55934460700": {"Name": "Gill U.S.", "AuthorID": "55934460700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, Bart's and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57196075608": {"Name": "Kennedy P.T.", "AuthorID": "57196075608", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Immunobiology, Blizard Institute, Bart's and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "35374746300": {"Name": "Rosenberg W.M.", "AuthorID": "35374746300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "25629557900": {"Name": "Fusai G.", "AuthorID": "25629557900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "56730197200": {"Name": "Robertson F.", "AuthorID": "56730197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7407042789": {"Name": "Chang C.", "AuthorID": "7407042789", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "7102329772": {"Name": "Trowsdale J.", "AuthorID": "7102329772", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "7006557342": {"Name": "Toubert A.", "AuthorID": "7006557342", "AffiliationID": "60123796, 60002900, 60000905, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, INSERM UMRS 1160, AP-HP, H\u00f4pital Saint-Louis"}}}
