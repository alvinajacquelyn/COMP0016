Conservation Letters published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.International legislation forms a cornerstone of conservation, yet its efficacy is rarely quantified. We assess whether species listed on Annex I of the European Union (EU) Birds Directive, for which EU Member States are obliged to implement special conservation measures, differ systematically in their short-term (2001-2012) or long-term (1980-2012) population trends from those of non-Annex I species. In both periods, Annex I species had more positive trends than non-Annex I species, particularly in countries that joined the EU earlier. There were additional signatures of climate change and life history strategy in the trends of species in one or both periods. Within Annex I species, long-distance migrants fared significantly worse than other species, suggesting that enhanced protection on the breeding grounds alone may be insufficient for these species. We conclude that the EU's conservation legislation has had a demonstrably positive impact on target species, even during a period in which climate change has significantly affected populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bird population trends", "birds directive", "climate change", "Conservation policy", "European Union", "migration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975055751", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"14024720200": {"Name": "Sanderson F.", "AuthorID": "14024720200", "AffiliationID": "60021721", "AffiliationName": "RSPB Centre for Conservation Science, RSPB, The Lodge"}, "7402332144": {"Name": "Gregory R.", "AuthorID": "7402332144", "AffiliationID": "60021721", "AffiliationName": "RSPB Centre for Conservation Science, RSPB, The Lodge"}, "25958889400": {"Name": "Beresford A.", "AuthorID": "25958889400", "AffiliationID": "60021721", "AffiliationName": "RSPB Centre for Conservation Science, RSPB, The Lodge"}, "12243573400": {"Name": "Donald P.", "AuthorID": "12243573400", "AffiliationID": "60021721", "AffiliationName": "RSPB Centre for Conservation Science, RSPB, The Lodge"}, "6507315307": {"Name": "Pople R.", "AuthorID": "6507315307", "AffiliationID": "60008090", "AffiliationName": "BirdLife International, Wellbrook Court"}, "54973787700": {"Name": "Ieronymidou C.", "AuthorID": "54973787700", "AffiliationID": "60008090", "AffiliationName": "BirdLife International, Wellbrook Court"}, "10038811700": {"Name": "Burfield I.", "AuthorID": "10038811700", "AffiliationID": "60008090", "AffiliationName": "BirdLife International, Wellbrook Court"}, "7103267539": {"Name": "Willis S.", "AuthorID": "7103267539", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Durham University"}, "7202774797": {"Name": "Howard C.", "AuthorID": "7202774797", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Durham University"}, "7202671420": {"Name": "Stephens P.", "AuthorID": "7202671420", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Durham University"}}}
