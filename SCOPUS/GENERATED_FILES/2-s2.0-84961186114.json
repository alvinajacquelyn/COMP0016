This randomized controlled trial investigated the outcomes of PIP for parents with mental health problems who also were experiencing high levels of social adversity and their young infants (<12 months). Dyads were clinically referred and randomly allocated to PIP or a control condition of standard secondary and specialist primary care treatment (n = 38 in each group). Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 6-month and 12-month follow-ups. The primary outcome was infant development. Secondary outcomes included parent-infant interaction, maternal psychopathology, maternal representations, maternal reflective functioning, and infant attachment. There were no differential effects over time between the groups on measures of infant development, parent-infant interaction, or maternal reflective functioning. Infant attachment classifications, measured only at the 12-month follow-up, did not differ between the groups. There were favorable outcomes over time for the PIP-treated dyads relative to the control group on several measures of maternal mental health, parenting stress, and parental representations of the baby and their relationship. The findings indicate potential benefits of parent-infant psychotherapy for improving mothers' psychological well-being and their representations of their baby and the parent-infant relationship.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attachment-based intervention", "Early intervention", "Parent-infant psychotherapy", "Postnatal depression", "RCT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child Development", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant", "Linear Models", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Mother-Child Relations", "Mothers", "Object Attachment", "Patient Compliance", "Psychotherapy", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961186114", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "12761729700": {"Name": "Sleed M.", "AuthorID": "12761729700", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and Anna Freud Centre"}, "6507314150": {"Name": "Baradon T.", "AuthorID": "6507314150", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "University of Witwatersrand"}}}
