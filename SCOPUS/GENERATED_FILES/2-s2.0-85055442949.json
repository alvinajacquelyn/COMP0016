The conference provided a forum for professionals involved in basic science, clinical research, regulatory affairs, and clinical care to meet and discuss the latest advances related to discovery and development of drugs and devices aimed at improving the management of people with epilepsy. This progress report provides a summary of findings on investigational compounds for which data from preclinical or early (phase I) clinical studies were presented. The compounds reviewed include adenosine and adenosine kinase inhibitors, BIS-001 (huperzine A), 2-deoxy-d-glucose, FV-082, FV-137, JNJ-40411813, JNJ-55511118 and analogs, ketone-enhanced antiepileptic drugs, oxynytones, OV329, TAK-935 (OV935), XEN901, and XEN1101. Many innovative approaches to drug development were presented. For example, some compounds are being combined with traditional antiepileptic drugs based on evidence of synergism in seizure models, some act as inhibitors of enzymes involved in modulation of neuronal activity, and some interact in novel ways with excitatory receptors or ion channels. Some of the compounds in development target the etiology of specific epilepsy syndromes (including orphan conditions) through precision medicine, and some offer hope of producing disease-modifying effects rather than symptomatic seizure suppression. Overall, the results summarized in the report indicate that important advances are being made in the effort to develop compounds with potentially improved efficacy and safety profiles compared with existing agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiepileptic drugs", "drug development", "epilepsy", "preclinical models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anticonvulsants", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Congresses as Topic", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Development", "Drugs, Investigational", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Spain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055442949", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55123546600": {"Name": "Bialer M.", "AuthorID": "55123546600", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, School of Pharmacy and David R.
