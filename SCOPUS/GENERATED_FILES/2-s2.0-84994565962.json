This graphene FET has a differential feeding structure and a high output impedance up to several thousand Ohms. These characteristics significantly challenge the antenna design, especially a high-performance antenna. To alleviate this issue, this paper presents a circularly bended dipole antenna on silicon substrate. The results show that, this novel antenna features a differential pair, a high impedance of 5000 Ohms, a high gain of 9.47 dBi, and also a narrow bandwidth of 3 GHz to filter out input noise. This antenna is a very good candidate for inherent integration, and will significantly improve the performance of the graphene-based THz detector.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Differential antenna", "graphene", "high-impedance antenna", "terahertz (THz) detector"], "IndexKeywords": ["Differential antennas", "Differential pairs", "Feeding structures", "Graphene field effect transistor (FET)", "High impedance", "Narrow bandwidth", "Silicon substrates", "Terahertz detectors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994565962", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"21834509700": {"Name": "Hu S.", "AuthorID": "21834509700", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}, "31767702600": {"Name": "Shen Y.", "AuthorID": "31767702600", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}, "24734356200": {"Name": "Meng H.", "AuthorID": "24734356200", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}, "7006874529": {"Name": "Dou W.", "AuthorID": "7006874529", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, Southeast University"}, "25632490300": {"Name": "Lombardo A.", "AuthorID": "25632490300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Center, University of Cambridge"}}}
