In his comments Morey (2014) presents some misrepresentations and misunderstandings that we remedy here. In contrast to what Morey (2014) propounds, our results suggest that the domestication of the wolf was a long process that started early in the Upper Palaeolithic and that since that time two sympatric canid morphotypes can be seen in Eurasian sites: Pleistocene wolves and Palaeolithic dogs. Contrary to Morey (2014), we are convinced that the study of this domestication process should be multidisciplinary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Canid morphotype", "Dog", "Domestication", "Palaeolithic", "Pleistocene", "Wolf"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920101537", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"6602438625": {"Name": "Germonpr\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "6602438625", "AffiliationID": "60068588", "AffiliationName": "Directorate Earth and History of Life, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences"}, "6507924182": {"Name": "Sablin M.", "AuthorID": "6507924182", "AffiliationID": "60101968", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Institute RAS"}, "35769214800": {"Name": "L\u00e1zni\u010dkov\u00e1-Galetov\u00e1 M.", "AuthorID": "35769214800", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Prehistory, USM 103 - CNRS UMR 7194, Institute of Human Paleontology"}, "16443862200": {"Name": "Despr\u00e9s V.", "AuthorID": "16443862200", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institute for General Botany, Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz"}, "8747066900": {"Name": "Stevens R.", "AuthorID": "8747066900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge"}, "21834940400": {"Name": "Stiller M.", "AuthorID": "21834940400", "AffiliationID": "60005807", "AffiliationName": "Department of Evolutionary Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology"}, "6701450663": {"Name": "Hofreiter M.", "AuthorID": "6701450663", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, The University of York"}}}
