All rights reserved.The association between childhood body weight and adult health has been little-examined, and findings are inconsistent. In a representative sample of the Scottish nation (the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947), we examined the association between body mass index measured at 11 years of age and future cause-specific mortality by age 77 years. In this cohort study, a maximum of 67 years of follow-up of 3839 study members gave rise to 1568 deaths (758 from cardiovascular disease, 610 from any malignancy). After adjustment for covariates, there was some evidence of a relation between elevated childhood body mass index and rates of mortality ascribed to all-causes (hazard ratio per 1 SD increase in body mass index; 95% confidence interval: 1.09; 1.03, 1.14), cardiovascular disease (1.09; 1.01, 1.17), all cancers combined (1.12; 1.03, 1.21), smoking-related cancers (1.13; 1.03, 1.25), and breast cancer in women (1.27; 1.04, 1.56). In conclusion, we provide further observational evidence for the need for weight control measures in youth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Child", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Pediatric Obesity", "Prospective Studies", "Scotland"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958280413", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "36889159100": {"Name": "Calvin C.", "AuthorID": "36889159100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57193752767": {"Name": "Deary I.", "AuthorID": "57193752767", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "23484393800": {"Name": "Brett C.", "AuthorID": "23484393800", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}, "56071738300": {"Name": "\u010cuki\u0107 I.", "AuthorID": "56071738300", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}}}
