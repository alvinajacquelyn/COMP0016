Apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 alleles have been associated with reduced memory function, and separately with higher vitamin D concentrations. This report aims to examine if the presence of APOE \u03b54 alleles contributes to the relationship between vitamin D and memory function. A total of 4848 (46% female) participants from the 1958 British birth cohort had information on APOE genotypes and completed memory tests at 50 years, where 4644 also had 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations measured at 45 years. Both low and high 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with lower memory function after adjustment for number of APOE \u03b54 alleles (P curvature =0.02). There was evidence of interaction between APOE \u03b54 and 25(OH)D, suggesting the association between 25(OH)D concentrations and memory function is different for those with two APOE \u03b54 alleles compared with those with zero or one APOE \u03b54 alleles (recessive model P interaction =0.01). Among participants with two APOE \u03b54 alleles, higher 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with higher memory function, whereas in others, memory scores were slightly lower for individuals with higher versus lower concentrations. Further studies are required to replicate these findings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Cognition", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Genotype", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Memory", "Middle Aged", "Nutritional Status", "Vitamin D"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926419076", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55577193000": {"Name": "Maddock J.", "AuthorID": "55577193000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55246086700": {"Name": "Cavadino A.", "AuthorID": "55246086700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57203229564": {"Name": "Power C.", "AuthorID": "57203229564", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55884875400": {"Name": "Hypp\u00f6nen E.", "AuthorID": "55884875400", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "School of Population Health, University of South Australia, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute"}}}
