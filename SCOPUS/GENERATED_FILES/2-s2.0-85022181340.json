The health-related Internet of Things (H-IoT) increasingly plays a key role in health management by providing real-time tele-monitoring of patients, testing of treatments, actuation of medical devices, and fitness and well-being monitoring. Given its numerous applications and proposed benefits, adoption by medical and social care institutions and consumers may be rapid. However, a host of ethical concerns are also raised that must be addressed. The inherent sensitivity of health-related data being generated and latent risks of Internet-enabled devices pose serious challenges. Users, already in a vulnerable position as patients, face a seemingly impossible task to retain control over their data due to the scale, scope and complexity of systems that create, aggregate, and analyse personal health data. In response, the H-IoT must be designed to be technologically robust and scientifically reliable, while also remaining ethically responsible, trustworthy, and respectful of user rights and interests. To assist developers of the H-IoT, this paper describes nine principles and nine guidelines for ethical design of H-IoT devices and data protocols.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Data analytics", "Data ethics", "Health", "Internet of things", "Responsible research and innovation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Data analytics", "Data ethics", "Ethical concerns", "Ethical principles", "Health management", "Health-care system", "Medical Devices", "Technological applications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022181340", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"57131461100": {"Name": "Mittelstadt B.", "AuthorID": "57131461100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}}}
