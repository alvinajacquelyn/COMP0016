Being bullied is still often wrongly considered as a 'normal rite of passage'. This review considers the importance of bullying as a major risk factor for poor physical and mental health and reduced adaptation to adult roles including forming lasting relationships, integrating into work and being economically independent. Bullying by peers has been mostly ignored by health professionals but should be considered as a significant risk factor and safeguarding issue.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Bullying", "Crime Victims", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Risk Factors", "Terminology as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939773203", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"7003469597": {"Name": "Wolke D.", "AuthorID": "7003469597", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, University of Warwick"}, "55660295300": {"Name": "Lereya S.", "AuthorID": "55660295300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Division of Mental Health and Wellbeing, University of Warwick"}}}
