In this development, spin pumping represents a convenient way to electrically detect magnetization dynamics. The effect originates from direct conversion of low-energy quantized spin waves in the magnet, known as magnons, into a flow of spins from the precessing magnet to adjacent leads. In this case, a secondary spin-charge conversion element, such as heavy metals with large spin Hall angle or multilayer layouts, is required to convert the spin current into a charge signal. Here, we report the experimental observation of charge pumping in which a precessing ferromagnet pumps a charge current, demonstrating direct conversion of magnons into high-frequency currents via the relativistic spin-orbit interaction. The generated electric current, unlike spin currents generated by spin-pumping, can be directly detected without the need of any additional spin-charge conversion mechanism. The charge-pumping phenomenon is generic and gives a deeper understanding of its reciprocal effect, the spin orbit torque, which is currently attracting interest for their potential in manipulating magnetic information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conversion mechanism", "High-frequency current", "Magnetic random access memory", "Magnetization dynamics", "Orbital degrees of freedom", "Spin orbit interactions", "Spin-orbit couplings", "Spin-torque oscillators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961355403", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6701868743": {"Name": "Ciccarelli C.", "AuthorID": "6701868743", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "7103233764": {"Name": "Irvine A.", "AuthorID": "7103233764", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "24071155200": {"Name": "Kurebayashi H.", "AuthorID": "24071155200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8618231300": {"Name": "Ferguson A.", "AuthorID": "8618231300", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "26664547100": {"Name": "Hals K.M.D.", "AuthorID": "26664547100", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Niels Bohr International Academy, Center for Quantum Devices, University of Copenhagen"}, "7004143305": {"Name": "Brataas A.", "AuthorID": "7004143305", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "34978887500": {"Name": "Novak V.", "AuthorID": "34978887500", "AffiliationID": "60016576", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics ASCR v.v.i."}, "6701709732": {"Name": "Tserkovnyak Y.", "AuthorID": "6701709732", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California"}}}
