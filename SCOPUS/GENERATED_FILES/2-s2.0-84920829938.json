Similar Zr\u2013Hf anomalies have only rarely been reported from clinopyroxene in spinel peridotite mantle xenoliths worldwide, and most are not as strong as the examples reported here. Low Hf contents give rise to a wide range of Lu/Hf ratios, which over geological time would result in highly radiogenic \u03b5Hf values, decoupling them from \u03b5Nd ratios. The high 176Lu/177Hf could in theory produce an isochronous relationship with 176Hf/177Hf over time; an errorchron is shown by clinopyroxene from mantle xenoliths from the northern Massif Central. However, in a review of the literature, we show that most mantle spinel peridotites do not show such high Lu/Hf ratios in their constituent clinopyroxenes, because they lack the distinctive Zr\u2013Hf anomaly, and this limits the usefulness of the application of the Lu\u2013Hf system of dating to garnet-free mantle rocks. Nevertheless, some mantle xenoliths from Poland or the Czech Republic may be amenable to Hf-isotope dating in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinopyroxene", "France", "Lu\u2013Hf geochronology", "Mantle", "Poland", "Spinel peridotite"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920829938", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57207506826": {"Name": "Downes H.", "AuthorID": "57207506826", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "56478472900": {"Name": "de Vries C.", "AuthorID": "56478472900", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "8694414700": {"Name": "Wittig N.", "AuthorID": "8694414700", "AffiliationID": "60017592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Carleton University"}}}
