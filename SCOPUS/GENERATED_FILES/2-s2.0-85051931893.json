Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Various neurotransmitters influence neuronal migration in the developing zebrafish hindbrain. Migrating tegmental hindbrain nuclei neurons (THNs) are governed by depolarizing neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and glutamate), and glycine. In mature neurons, glycine binds to its receptor to hyperpolarize cells. This effect depends on the co-expression of the solute carrier KCC2. Immature precursors, however, typically express NKCC1 instead of KCC2, leading to membrane depolarization upon glycine receptor activation. As neuronal migration occurs in neurons after leaving the cell cycle and before terminal differentiation, we hypothesized that the switch from NKCC1 to KCC2 expression could alter the effect of glycine on THN migration. We tested this notion using in vivo cell tracking, overexpression of glycine receptor mutations and whole mount in situ hybridization. We summarize our findings in a speculative model, combining developmental age, glycine receptor strength and solute carrier expression to describe the effect of glycine on the migration of THNs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["glycine", "glycine receptor alpha 1", "Neuronal migration", "neurotransmitters", "NKCC1", "zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051931893", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"24779750200": {"Name": "Theisen U.", "AuthorID": "24779750200", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "TU Braunschweig, Zoological Institute, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology"}, "57203511919": {"Name": "Hey S.", "AuthorID": "57203511919", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "TU Braunschweig, Zoological Institute, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology"}, "7103357791": {"Name": "K\u00f6ster R.", "AuthorID": "7103357791", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "TU Braunschweig, Zoological Institute, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology"}, "35302390700": {"Name": "Hennig C.", "AuthorID": "35302390700", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "TU Braunschweig, Institute for Genetics"}, "56234735500": {"Name": "Schnabel R.", "AuthorID": "56234735500", "AffiliationID": "60007902", "AffiliationName": "TU Braunschweig, Institute for Genetics"}}}
