Here we study terahertz generation from nonlinear metasurface consisting of single layer nanoscale split-ring resonator array. The terahertz generation due to optical rectification by the second-order nonlinearity of the split-ring resonator is investigated by a time-domain implementation of the hydrodynamic model for electron dynamics in metal. The results show that the nonlinear metasurface enables us to generate broadband terahertz radiation and free from quasi-phase-matching conditions. The proposed scheme provides a new concept of broadband THz source and designing nonlinear plasmonic metamaterials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Broadband terahertz", "Broadband thz sources", "Nonlinear properties", "Optical rectifications", "Quasi phase matching", "Second-order nonlinearity", "Split ring resonator", "Terahertz generation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047646082", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57201198869": {"Name": "Fang M.", "AuthorID": "57201198869", "AffiliationID": "60008023, 60004354", "AffiliationName": "Ames Laboratory, U.S. DOE and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University"}, "56435603900": {"Name": "Niu K.", "AuthorID": "56435603900", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University"}, "57213575235": {"Name": "Huang Z.", "AuthorID": "57213575235", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University"}, "55621370600": {"Name": "Wu X.", "AuthorID": "55621370600", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing and Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Micro-nano Electronic Devices and Smart Systems of Zhejiang Province, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "6603030704": {"Name": "Koschny T.", "AuthorID": "6603030704", "AffiliationID": "60008023, 60004354", "AffiliationName": "Ames Laboratory, U.S. DOE and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University"}, "7006628963": {"Name": "Soukoulis C.M.", "AuthorID": "7006628963", "AffiliationID": "60029857, 60019181", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Electronic Structure and Lasers (IESL), FORTH"}}}
