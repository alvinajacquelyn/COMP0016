Single-sideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (SSB-OFDM) with direct detection is a potential solution; however, it suffers a penalty from signal-signal beat interference (SSBI) caused by the square-law photodetection. In this paper, a novel DSP-based SSBI mitigation technique, with lower complexity than previously proposed methods, is proposed and assessed through numerical simulations for the first time. The performance improvement is quantified by simulations of 9 \u00d7 112 Gb/s 16-QAM SSB-OFDM signal with a net optical ISD of 2.1 (b/s)/Hz. The performance is shown to be similar to that of the more complex receiver-based iterative SSBI compensation technique. Simulations predict an 8.7 dB reduction in the required OSNR at the 7% overhead HD-FEC threshold, and increases up to 100% in maximum reach over uncompensated standard single-mode fibre using the proposed simplified SSBI compensation technique.", "AuthorKeywords": ["direct detection", "electronic pre-distortion", "Optical communication", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing", "signal-signal beat interference cancellation", "spectrally efficient wavelength division multiplexing", "subcarrier modulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compensation techniques", "Direct detection", "Information spectral density", "Interference cancellation", "Interference mitigation", "Mitigation techniques", "Pre-distortion", "Sub-carrier modulations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962888131", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56703765300": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56703765300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "37028187400": {"Name": "Erkilin\u00e7 M.S.", "AuthorID": "37028187400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56066290300": {"Name": "Bouziane R.", "AuthorID": "56066290300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.C.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.I.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
