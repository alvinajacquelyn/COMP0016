Kv7.2 gene mutations cause early-onset neonatal seizures with heterogeneous clinical outcomes, ranging from self-limiting benign familial neonatal seizures to severe early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (Kv7.2-EE). In this study, the biochemical and functional consequences prompted by a recurrent variant (R325G) found independently in four individuals with severe forms of neonatal-onset EE have been investigated. Upon heterologous expression, homomeric Kv7.2 R325G channels were non-functional, despite biotin-capture in Western blots revealed normal plasma membrane subunit expression. Mutant subunits exerted dominant-negative effects when incorporated into heteromeric channels with Kv7.2 and/or Kv7.3 subunits. Increasing cellular PIP2 levels by co-expression of type 1\u03b3 PI(4)P5-kinase (PIP5K) partially recovered homomeric Kv7.2 R325G channel function. Currents carried by heteromeric channels incorporating Kv7.2 R325G subunits were more readily inhibited than wild-type channels upon activation of a voltage-sensitive phosphatase (VSP), and recovered more slowly upon VSP switch-off. These results reveal for the first time that a mutation-induced decrease in current sensitivity to PIP2 is the primary molecular defect responsible for Kv7.2-EE in individuals carrying the R325G variant, further expanding the range of pathogenetic mechanisms exploitable for personalized treatment of Kv7.2-related epilepsies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Animals", "Brain Diseases", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Epilepsy, Generalized", "KCNQ2 Potassium Channel", "KCNQ3 Potassium Channel", "Membrane Potentials", "Mutation, Missense", "Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000502031", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"9639548800": {"Name": "Soldovieri M.V.", "AuthorID": "9639548800", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "26533999800": {"Name": "Ambrosino P.", "AuthorID": "26533999800", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "56715936300": {"Name": "Mosca I.", "AuthorID": "56715936300", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "55998574100": {"Name": "De Maria M.", "AuthorID": "55998574100", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "56716256500": {"Name": "Manocchio L.", "AuthorID": "56716256500", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "56728522800": {"Name": "Medoro A.", "AuthorID": "56728522800", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "7005087204": {"Name": "Taglialatela M.", "AuthorID": "7005087204", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Naples Federico II"}, "55848637200": {"Name": "Moretto E.", "AuthorID": "55848637200", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine (BIOMETRA), University of Milan"}, "6701919514": {"Name": "Passafaro M.", "AuthorID": "6701919514", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR Institute of Neuroscience, Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine (BIOMETRA), University of Milan"}, "9639151600": {"Name": "Miceli F.", "AuthorID": "9639151600", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, University of Naples Federico II"}, "24068310200": {"Name": "Alaimo A.", "AuthorID": "24068310200", "AffiliationID": "60103758, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Biofisika (UPV/EHU, CSIC)"}, "14029917100": {"Name": "Iraci N.", "AuthorID": "14029917100", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Salerno"}}}
