Molecular phylogenetics strongly support pitheciid monophyly, whereas morphological analyses infer a range of phylogenies including a sister relationship between Aotus and Callicebus. We collected geometric morphometric cranial data from pitheciids and Aotus, and used cranial data for distance-based phylogenetic analysis and tests of phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic analyses of pitheciids were repeated with Lagothrix, Callimico, and Saimiri outgroups for Procrustes shape with and without Aotus based on the whole cranium and six anatomical regions. All phylogenetic signal tests were significant, and tree lengths were shortest and had the least morphological change over the phylogeny for Procrustes residuals from the cranial base and palate. The majority of phylogenetic analyses of Procrustes shape for pitheciids without Aotus supported the molecular phylogeny, and with Aotus included the majority inferred an Aotus\u2013Callicebus clade, although three analyses with Callimico as outgroup supported the molecular phylogeny. The morphological similarity of Aotus and Callicebus is likely a mix of plesiomorphy, allometry, and homoplasy, and future phylogenetic inference of living and extinct platyrrhine taxa should consider the impact of these factors alongside outgroup selection and cranial region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allometry", "geometric morphometrics", "homoplasy", "platyrrhines"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cebidae", "Central America", "Phylogeny", "Pitheciidae", "Platyrrhini", "Skull"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006010353", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"16634510400": {"Name": "Bjarnason A.", "AuthorID": "16634510400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "55853593700": {"Name": "Soligo C.", "AuthorID": "55853593700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "6701517719": {"Name": "Elton S.", "AuthorID": "6701517719", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Durham University"}}}
