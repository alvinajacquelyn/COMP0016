Design: An explorative qualitative design. Seven focus groups were convened, audio recorded, fully transcribed and analysed using a constant comparative method to inductively derive a thematic account of the data. Setting: Four geographical areas of the UK. Participants: 25 people with JHS and 16 health professionals (14 physiotherapists and two podiatrists). Results: Both patients and health professionals recognised the chronic heterogeneous nature of JHS and reported a lack of awareness of the condition amongst health professionals, patients and wider society. Diagnosis and subsequent referral to physiotherapy services for JHS was often difficult and convoluted. Referral was often for acute single joint injury, failing to recognise the long-term multi-joint nature of the condition. Health professionals and patients felt that if left undiagnosed, JHS was more difficult to treat because of its chronic nature. When JHS was treated by health professionals with knowledge of the condition patients reported satisfactory outcomes. There was considerable agreement between health professionals and patients regarding an 'ideal' physiotherapy service. Education was reported as an overarching requirement for patients and health care professionals. Conclusions: Physiotherapy should be applied holistically to manage JHS as a long-term condition and should address injury prevention and symptom amelioration rather than cure. Education for health professionals and patients is needed to optimise physiotherapy provision. Further research is required to explore the specific therapeutic actions of physiotherapy for managing JHS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benign hypermobility syndrome", "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type", "Focus groups", "Life experiences", "Physiotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Chronic Disease", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Joint Instability", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Qualitative Research", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Syndrome", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931402498", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"7402329291": {"Name": "Palmer S.", "AuthorID": "7402329291", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Department of Allied Health Professions, University of the West of England"}, "57206341204": {"Name": "Terry R.", "AuthorID": "57206341204", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC), School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "55807959600": {"Name": "Horwood J.", "AuthorID": "55807959600", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration (BRTC), School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "6602638132": {"Name": "Rimes K.A.", "AuthorID": "6602638132", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55358626500": {"Name": "Clark C.", "AuthorID": "55358626500", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Care, Bournemouth University"}, "20434379700": {"Name": "Simmonds J.", "AuthorID": "20434379700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
