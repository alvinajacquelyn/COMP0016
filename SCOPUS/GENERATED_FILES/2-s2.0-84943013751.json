This study examines the effect of the adaptive thermal comfort of indoor environment control in hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) zones. This work is based on a field study of the regional thermal assessment of two typical cases, the results of which are compared with simulated results of various scenarios of \"energy efficiency\" strategy and \"healthy housing\" environmental control. First, the simulated results show that the adaptive thermal comfort of indoor environment control is actually balanced in terms of occupancy, comfort, and energy efficiency. Second, adaptive thermal comfort control can save more energy for heating or cooling than other current healthy housing environmental controls in China[U+05F3]s HSCW zone. Moreover, a large proportion of energy use is based on the subjective thermal comfort demand of occupants in any building type. Third, the building shape coefficient cannot dominate energy savings. The ratio of the superficial area of a building to the actual indoor floor area has a significant positive correlation with and affects the efficiency of building thermal performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive thermal comfort", "Building performance", "China HSCW zone", "Low energy residential buildings", "Simulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943013751", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57192624151": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57192624151", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}, "24757803500": {"Name": "Altan H.", "AuthorID": "24757803500", "AffiliationID": "60070792", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and IT, The British University in Dubai, DIAC"}}}
