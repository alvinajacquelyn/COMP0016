{"Title": "Detailed Assessment of Renal Function in a Proband with Harboyan Syndrome Caused by a Novel Homozygous SLC4A11 Nonsense Mutation", "Year": 2015, "Source": "Ophthalmic Res.", "Volume": "53", "Issue": 1, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 30, "PageEnd": 35, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.1159/000365109", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84928423971&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2014 S. Karger AG.Background/Aims: To identify the underlying molecular genetic cause of disease in a patient with Harboyan syndrome and to perform a detailed assessment of her renal function. We also assessed the influence of the SLC4A11 mutation identified on the corneal endothelium in the heterozygous state. Methods: A 55-year-old female was examined ophthalmologically, audiologically and nephrologically including 24-hour urine collection. The coding region of SLC4A11 was directly sequenced. Specular microscopy was performed in the proband's 21-year-old daughter. Results: The proband had bilateral iridectomy at the age of 3 months because of an initial diagnosis of congenital glaucoma and since the age of 12 years she underwent several keratoplasties in each eye. Nephrological examination did not reveal any abnormalities. Moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss was confirmed by audiometry. A novel homozygous mutation predicted to lead to a premature stop codon at the protein level, c.2188C>T; p.(Arg730\u2217), was identified in SLC4A11. No changes in corneal endothelial cell morphology or density were observed in the heterozygous daughter. Conclusion: In contrast to the Slc4a11<sup>-/-</sup> mouse, no abnormalities in daily renal ion excretion or polyuria were observed in the Harboyan syndrome patient. The mutation identified does not affect corneal endothelial cell morphology or density in the heterozygous state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corneal dystrophy", "Harboyan syndrome", "Kidney function tests", "Sensorineural hearing loss", "SLC4A11"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anion Transport Proteins", "Antiporters", "Audiometry", "Codon, Nonsense", "Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary", "Corneal Pachymetry", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Female", "Hearing Loss, Sensorineural", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Function Tests", "Liver Function Tests", "Middle Aged", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928423971", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"14119954300": {"Name": "Liskova P.", "AuthorID": "14119954300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "51763434300": {"Name": "Dudakova L.", "AuthorID": "51763434300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of the Biology and Pathology of the Eye, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "12773057900": {"Name": "Jirsova K.", "AuthorID": "12773057900", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of the Biology and Pathology of the Eye, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "7102290100": {"Name": "Tesar V.", "AuthorID": "7102290100", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "6602440970": {"Name": "Bednarova V.", "AuthorID": "6602440970", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "55552077100": {"Name": "Kidorova J.", "AuthorID": "55552077100", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Charles University in Prague, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "35315591900": {"Name": "Davidson A.", "AuthorID": "35315591900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57197636332": {"Name": "Hardcastle A.", "AuthorID": "57197636332", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
