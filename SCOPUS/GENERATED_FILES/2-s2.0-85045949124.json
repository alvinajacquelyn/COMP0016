The microbial properties of poly(methyl methacrylate) fibres containing 2, 4 and 8 wt% of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) were studied. GNPs were dispersed in a polymeric solution and processed using pressurized gyration. Electron microscopy was used to characterize GNP and fibre morphology. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the formation of beaded porous fibres. GNP concentration was found to dictate fibre morphology. As the GNP concentration increased, the average fibre diameter increased from 0.75 to 2.71 mm, while fibre porosity decreased. Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used to investigate the properties of 2, 4 and 8 wt% GNP-loaded fibres. GNP-loaded fibres (0 wt%) were used as the negative control. The fibres were incubated for 24 h with the bacteria; bacterial colony-forming units were enumerated by adopting the colony-counting method. The presence of 2 and 4 wt% GNP-loaded fibres promoted microbial growth, while 8 wt% GNP-loaded fibres showed antimicrobial activity. These results indicate that the minimum inhibitory concentration of GNPs required within a fibre is 8 wt%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacterial activity", "Fibres", "Graphene", "Gyration", "Nanomaterials", "Pressurized gyration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045949124", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57194638490": {"Name": "Matharu R.", "AuthorID": "57194638490", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "46761372500": {"Name": "Porwal H.", "AuthorID": "46761372500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "18435943500": {"Name": "Ciric L.", "AuthorID": "18435943500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
