Lett.", "Volume": "39", "Issue": 12, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 1865, "PageEnd": 1873, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1007/s10529-017-2425-z", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85028966581&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017, The Author(s).Objectives: To reduce unwanted Fab\u2019 leakage from an autonucleolytic Escherichia coli strain, which co-expresses OmpA-signalled Staphylococcal nuclease and Fab\u2019 fragment in the periplasm, by substituting in Serratial nuclease and the DsbA periplasm translocation signal as alternatives. Results: We attempted to genetically fuse a nuclease from Serratia marcescens to the OmpA signal peptide but plasmid construction failed, possibly due to toxicity of the resultant nuclease. Combining Serratial nuclease to the DsbA signal peptide was successful. The strain co-expressing this nuclease and periplasmic Fab\u2019 grew in complex media and exhibited nuclease activity detectable by DNAse agar plate but its growth in defined medium was retarded. Fab\u2019 coexpression with Staphylococcal nuclease fused to the DsbA signal peptide resulted in cells exhibiting nuclease activity and growth in defined medium. In cultivation to high cell density in a 5 l bioreactor, DsbA-fused Staphylococcal nuclease co-expression coincided with reduced Fab\u2019 leakage relative to the original autonucleolytic Fab\u2019 strain with OmpA-fused staphylococcal nuclease. Conclusions: We successfully rescued Fab\u2019 leakage back to acceptable levels and established a basis for future investigation of the linkage between periplasmic nuclease expression and leakage of co-expressed periplasmic Fab\u2019 fragment to the surrounding growth media.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonucleolytic", "Bioprocess", "Fab\u2019 fragment", "Leakage", "Nuclease", "Periplasm"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autonucleolytic", "Bioprocesses", "High cell density", "Nuclease", "Nuclease activity", "Periplasm", "Serratia marcescens", "Staphylococcal nuclease", "Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins", "Bioreactors", "Cell Survival", "Endodeoxyribonucleases", "Endoribonucleases", "Escherichia coli", "Escherichia coli Proteins", "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments", "Metabolic Engineering", "Protein Disulfide-Isomerases", "Protein Sorting Signals", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028966581", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57189223835": {"Name": "Schofield D.M.", "AuthorID": "57189223835", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701613219": {"Name": "Keshavarz-Moore E.", "AuthorID": "6701613219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.M.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "8856685700": {"Name": "Nesbeth D.N.", "AuthorID": "8856685700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56989968800": {"Name": "Sirka E.", "AuthorID": "56989968800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, UCL Institute of Child Health & Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
