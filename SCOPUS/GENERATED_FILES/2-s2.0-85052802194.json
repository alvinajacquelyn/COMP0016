To generate a faithful representation of changes in sound intensity and frequency over time, sound offsets (disappearances) as well as sound onsets (appearances) must be encoded by the auditory system. We review here the computational significance, perceptual roles, anatomical locations, and cellular and network origins of sound-offset responses in the mammalian auditory brain. We show that sound-offset responses arise from mechanisms and pathways distinct from those producing sound-onset responses, and are likely to be essential for auditory processing of temporally discontinuous sounds such as speech.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gap detection", "hearing", "ON/OFF asymmetries", "post-inhibitory rebound", "sound", "temporal processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Animals", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Pathways", "Auditory Perception", "Brain", "Humans", "Speech"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052802194", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6506459609": {"Name": "Kopp-Scheinpflug C.", "AuthorID": "6506459609", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurobiology, Department Biology II, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "55734707100": {"Name": "Sinclair J.L.", "AuthorID": "55734707100", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London"}, "57204347332": {"Name": "Linden J.F.", "AuthorID": "57204347332", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology, and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
