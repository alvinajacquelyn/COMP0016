Whilst surgical correction is achievable in most patients, when a long gap is present it still represents a major challenge associated with higher morbidity and mortality. In this context, tissue engineering could represent a successful alternative to restore oesophageal function and structure. Naturally derived biomaterials made of decellularized tissues retain native extracellular matrix architecture and composition, providing a suitable bed for the anchorage and growth of relevant cell types. Areas covered: This review outlines the various strategies and challenges in esophageal tissue engineering, highlighting the evolution of ideas in the development of decellularized scaffolds for clinical use. It explores the interplay between clinical needs, ethical dilemmas, and manufacturing challenges in the development of a tissue engineered decellularized scaffold for oesophageal atresia. Expert opinion: Current progress on oesophageal tissue engineering has enabled effective repair of patch defects, whilst the development of a full circumferential construct remains a challenge. Despite the different approaches available and the improvements achieved, a gold standard for fully functional tissue engineered oesophageal constructs has not been defined yet.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Esophageal Atresia", "Extracellular Matrix", "Humans", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018295871", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"57194026152": {"Name": "Lee E.", "AuthorID": "57194026152", "AffiliationID": "60113363", "AffiliationName": "Bioprocessing Technology Institute, Agency for Science Technology and Research (A*STAR)"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell, Gene & Tissue Therapeutics, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57189371637": {"Name": "Milan A.", "AuthorID": "57189371637", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, Institute of Child Health"}, "35076756500": {"Name": "Urbani L.", "AuthorID": "35076756500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, Institute of Child Health"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine Section, Institute of Child Health"}}}
