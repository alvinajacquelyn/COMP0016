Several immunoassays for CSF A\u03b21\u201342 are commercially available, but can suffer from between laboratory and batch-to-batch variability as well as lack of standardisation across assays. As a consequence, no general cut-off values have been established for a specific context of use (e.g., clinical diagnostics) and selection of individuals for enrolment in clinical trials (patient stratification) remains challenging. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) has initiated a working group for CSF proteins (WG-CSF) to facilitate standardisation of CSF A\u03b21\u201342 measurement results. The efforts of the IFCC WG-CSF include the development of certified reference materials (CRMs) and reference measurement procedures (RMPs) for key biomarkers. Two candidate RMPs for quantification of A\u03b21\u201342 in CSF based on liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry have been developed and tested in two ring trials. Furthermore, two commutability studies including native CSF pools, artificial CSF and spiked materials have been completed. On the basis of these studies, human CSF pools containing only endogenous A\u03b21\u201342 at three concentrations were selected as the format for future CRMs that are now being processed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "A\u03b21\u201342", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Certified reference material", "Reference measurement procedure"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Clinical Chemistry Tests", "Humans", "Peptide Fragments", "Reference Standards"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016990207", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"35083743300": {"Name": "Kuhlmann J.", "AuthorID": "35083743300", "AffiliationID": "60103695, 60029640", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements"}, "6603576442": {"Name": "Zegers I.", "AuthorID": "6603576442", "AffiliationID": "60103695, 60029640", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements"}, "7006577481": {"Name": "Schimmel H.", "AuthorID": "7006577481", "AffiliationID": "60103695, 60029640", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry LaboratorySahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "36574061600": {"Name": "Pannee J.", "AuthorID": "36574061600", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry LaboratorySahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "16047002600": {"Name": "Bjerke M.", "AuthorID": "16047002600", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry LaboratorySahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry LaboratorySahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry LaboratorySahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "24070740000": {"Name": "Leinenbach A.", "AuthorID": "24070740000", "AffiliationID": "60072289", "AffiliationName": "Roche Diagnostics GmbH"}, "16644532800": {"Name": "Bittner T.", "AuthorID": "16644532800", "AffiliationID": "60072289", "AffiliationName": "Roche Diagnostics GmbH"}, "6602867959": {"Name": "Korecka M.", "AuthorID": "6602867959", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine"}, "57203176542": {"Name": "Shaw L.M.", "AuthorID": "57203176542", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine"}, "36725884600": {"Name": "Jenkins R.G.", "AuthorID": "36725884600", "AffiliationID": "60017154", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chromatographic Sciences, PPD Laboratories"}, "7003790485": {"Name": "Vanderstichele H.", "AuthorID": "7003790485", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx NeuroSciences NV"}, "21036335500": {"Name": "Stoops E.", "AuthorID": "21036335500", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx NeuroSciences NV"}, "55156917800": {"Name": "Lewczuk P.", "AuthorID": "55156917800", "AffiliationID": "60026724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegeneration Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
