Contrary to the law\u2019s conception of trademarks, brands are used to indicate far more than source and/or quality. This volume begins the process of broadening the legal understanding of brands by explaining what brands are and how they function, how trademark and antitrust/competition law have misunderstood brands, and the implications of continuing to ignore the role brands play in business competition. This is the first book to engage with the topic from an interdisciplinary perspective, hence it will be a must-have for all those interested in the phenomenon of brands and how their function is recognized by the legal system. The book integrates both a competition and an intellectual property law dimension and explores the regulatory environment and case law in both Europe and the United States.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954205153", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"36711534600": {"Name": "Desai D.", "AuthorID": "36711534600", "AffiliationID": "60116662, 60019647", "AffiliationName": "Georgia Institute of Technology, Scheller College of Business"}, "23088833500": {"Name": "Lianos I.", "AuthorID": "23088833500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Laws, University College London (UCL), Centre for Law, Economics and Society"}, "24436941600": {"Name": "Waller S.", "AuthorID": "24436941600", "AffiliationID": "60003545", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Consumer Antitrust Studies, Loyola University Chicago School of Law"}}}
