This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 License.We discuss some of the features of the R add-on package GJRM which implements a ffiexible joint modeling framework for fitting a number of multivariate response regression models under various sampling schemes. In particular, we focus on the case inwhich the user wishes to fit bivariate binary regression models in the presence of several forms of selection bias. The framework allows for Gaussian and non-Gaussian dependencies through the use of copulae, and for the association and mean parameters to depend on ffiexible functions of covariates. We describe some of the methodological details underpinning the bivariate binary models implemented in the package and illustrate them by fitting interpretable models of different complexity on three data-sets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binary data", "Confounding", "Copula", "Joint model", "Penalized smoother", "R", "Selection bias", "Simultaneous parameter estimation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044145359", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36005147900": {"Name": "Marra G.", "AuthorID": "36005147900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "23985987100": {"Name": "Radice R.", "AuthorID": "23985987100", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60162130", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
