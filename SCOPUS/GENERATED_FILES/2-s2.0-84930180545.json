Method We examined the association between IL-6 and symptom resolution in a non-clinical sample of participants with psychological distress. Results Relative to high IL-6 levels, low levels at baseline were associated with symptom resolution at follow-up [age- and sex-adjusted risk ratio (RR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.25]. Further adjustment for covariates had little effect on the association. Symptomatic participants with repeated low IL-6 were more likely to be symptom-free at follow-up compared with those with repeated high IL-6 (RR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.41). Among the symptomatic participants with elevated IL-6 at baseline, IL-6 decreased along with symptom resolution. Conclusions IL-6 is potentially related to the mechanisms underlying recovery from symptoms of mental ill health. Further studies are needed to examine these mechanisms and to confirm the findings in relation to clinical depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "common mental disorders", "cytokines", "depression", "inflammation", "interleukin", "recovery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Chronic Disease", "Cohort Studies", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Health Status Indicators", "Humans", "Interleukin-6", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Remission Induction", "Stress, Psychological", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930180545", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35239241500": {"Name": "Virtanen M.", "AuthorID": "35239241500", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "15749838700": {"Name": "Alenius H.", "AuthorID": "15749838700", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "12769331900": {"Name": "Haapakoski R.", "AuthorID": "12769331900", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "15070433300": {"Name": "Akbaraly T.N.", "AuthorID": "15070433300", "AffiliationID": "60108488", "AffiliationName": "University Montpellier 2"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60021567, 60106085, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Inserm, U1018, AP-HP"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8293151800": {"Name": "Allan C.L.", "AuthorID": "8293151800", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "7004932147": {"Name": "Ebmeier K.P.", "AuthorID": "7004932147", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Warneford Hospital"}, "56678958000": {"Name": "Lowe G.D.", "AuthorID": "56678958000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}}}
