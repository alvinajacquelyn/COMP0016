The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between personal characteristics, wheelchair users\u2019 transferring technique and the other factors that can affect the performance of wheelchair transfers. Method: A cross-sectional survey study was designed to recruit wheelchair users, aged 18 or older, performing sitting-pivot or standing-pivot wheelchair transfers, independently or with assistance. Results: Forty-two usable surveys were returned. Transferring technique is usually determined by the individual\u2019s impairment. In turn, transferring technique will greatly affect the perceived difficulty of different types of wheelchair transfers and, the number of transfers that people will perform in a day. The presence of upper limb pain increased the difficulty reported for certain types of transfers while the use of assistive technologies appears to be only partially successful in facilitating the performance of wheelchair transfers. Conclusion: This study highlights the complexity of the factors included in the performance of wheelchair transfers. Findings from this survey can be utilized to broaden the boundaries of future research.Implications for rehabilitation Transferring technique is usually determined by the individual?s impairment. In turn, transferring technique will greatly affect the perceived difficulty of different types of wheelchair transfers and, the number of transfers that people will perform in a day. The performance of wheelchair transfers exacerbate the painful symptomatology of the person, regardless of their medical condition or transferring technique. The presence of pain increases the reported difficulty of wheelchair trasnfers. Use of assistive technologies during transfers is linked to the increased body weight of the person, while the choice of the type of assistive technology seems to be dependent of the transferring technique used by the person. Overall, available ATs are only moderately effective in enabling people to perform wheelchair transfer and they can be cause of frustration for the users due to their high cost and limited functionality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["assistive technologies", "survey", "upper limb pain", "Wheelchair transfers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disabled Persons", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Moving and Lifting Patients", "Pain", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Wheelchairs", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045620955", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57038765200": {"Name": "Barbareschi G.", "AuthorID": "57038765200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "7101643482": {"Name": "Holloway C.", "AuthorID": "7101643482", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre, University College London"}}}
