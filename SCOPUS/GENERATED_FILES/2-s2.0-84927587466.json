The main goal is to meet the diverse communication needs of the users, while the global system operation satisfies the business and societal goals of the infrastructure and service providers. This calls for solutions that consider both local and global network viewpoints and provide sophisticated system control in a stable and predictable way, while being service-aware. We propose a fully integrated solution along these lines: the VLSP, a service-aware softwaredefined infrastructure for networks and clouds. The VLSP consists of three main distributed systems: a facility performing uniformly logicallycentralized management and control of the infrastructure, called the virtual infrastructure management; an information management infrastructure able to maintain an accurate view of the infrastructure environment at both the local and system levels, called the virtual infrastructure information service; and a lightweight virtualization hypervisor able to perform configuration changes in the infrastructure resources, called the lightweight network hypervisor. We discuss representative use-case scenarios, while we demonstrate how VLSP tunes performance trade-offs for particular service demands.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diverse communications", "Infrastructure resources", "Internet infrastructure", "Management and controls", "Management infrastructure", "Software-defined networks", "Virtual infrastructure managements", "Virtual infrastructures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927587466", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"14422440700": {"Name": "Mamatas L.", "AuthorID": "14422440700", "AffiliationID": "60001086", "AffiliationName": "University of Macedonia, GRC"}, "35217494700": {"Name": "Clayman S.", "AuthorID": "35217494700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603596791": {"Name": "Galis A.", "AuthorID": "6603596791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
