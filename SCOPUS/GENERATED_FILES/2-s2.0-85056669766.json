Previous work identified, however, some challenges caused by user's unfamiliarity with this modality and complexity in the scent delivery. We are now able to overcome these challenges, introducing a training approach to familiarize scent-meaning associations (urgency of a message, and sender identity) and using a controllable device for the scent-delivery. Here we re-validate the effectiveness of smell as notification modality and present findings on the performance of smell in conveying information. In a user study composed of two sessions we compared the effectiveness of visual, olfactory, and combined visual-olfactory notifications in a messaging application. We demonstrated that olfactory notifications improve users' confidence and performance in identifying the urgency level of a message, with the same reaction time and disruption levels as for visual notifications. We discuss the design implications and opportunities for future work in the domain of multimodal interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disruptiveness", "Multimodal notifications", "Olfactory Familiarization/Training", "Olfactory Notifications", "Performance", "Slack"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disruptiveness", "Multi-modal", "Olfactory Familiarization/Training", "Olfactory Notifications", "Performance", "Slack"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056669766", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"56582009700": {"Name": "Maggioni E.", "AuthorID": "56582009700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, Creative Technology Research Group, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57204676057": {"Name": "Cobden R.", "AuthorID": "57204676057", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, Creative Technology Research Group, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57193237811": {"Name": "Dmitrenko D.", "AuthorID": "57193237811", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, Creative Technology Research Group, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "22835490000": {"Name": "Obrist M.", "AuthorID": "22835490000", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI Lab, Creative Technology Research Group, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
