Most publications have focused on guidelines that inform clinicians dealing with these deaths, educating patients, potential risk factors and mechanisms. There is a relative paucity of information available for pathologists who conduct these autopsies regarding appropriate post mortem practice and investigations. As we move from recognizing SUDEP as the most common form of ERD toward in-depth investigations into its causes and prevention, health professionals involved with these autopsies and post mortem procedure must remain fully informed. Systematizing a more comprehensive and consistent practice of examining these cases will facilitate (i) more precise determination of cause of death, (ii) identification of SUDEP for improved epidemiological surveillance (the first step for an intervention study), and (iii) biobanking and cell-based research. This article reviews how pathologists and healthcare professionals have approached ERD, current practices, logistical problems and areas to improve and harmonize. The main neuropathology, cardiac and genetic findings in SUDEP are outlined, providing a framework for best practices, integration of clinical, pathological and molecular genetic investigations in SUDEP, and ultimately prevention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biobanking", "epilepsy-related death", "post mortem", "SUDEP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Specimen Banks", "Brain", "Death, Sudden", "Epilepsy", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042371621", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"7004423623": {"Name": "Thom M.", "AuthorID": "7004423623", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602359436": {"Name": "Boldrini M.", "AuthorID": "6602359436", "AffiliationID": "60029358, 60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University Medical Centre, Divisions of Molecular Imaging and Neuropathology, New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "15922415800": {"Name": "Bundock E.", "AuthorID": "15922415800", "AffiliationID": "100414714", "AffiliationName": "Office of the Chief Medical Examiner"}, "57200794087": {"Name": "Sheppard M.N.", "AuthorID": "57200794087", "AffiliationID": "60032542", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, St George's University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102688352": {"Name": "Devinsky O.", "AuthorID": "7102688352", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, NYU Epilepsy Center"}}}
