However, the causal pathway linking genetic variants in CACNA1C with increased risk for developing brain disorders remains unclear. Here, we explored the association between the rs1006737 SNP and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. We found a significant association between the risk allele in rs1006737 and a decreased CSF hyperphosphorylated tau/ total tau ratio in patients with bipolar disorder, thus linking variation in the CACNA1C gene to a neurochemical marker of neuroaxonal plasticity in those with this disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alleles", "Biomarkers", "Bipolar Disorder", "Calcium Channels, L-Type", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Variation", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phosphorylation", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957927273", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55508135900": {"Name": "Jakobsson J.", "AuthorID": "55508135900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6603374219": {"Name": "Palsson E.", "AuthorID": "6603374219", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "57112681200": {"Name": "Rydberg F.", "AuthorID": "57112681200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7005304831": {"Name": "Ekman A.", "AuthorID": "7005304831", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7004259279": {"Name": "Land\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "7004259279", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "37020689800": {"Name": "Sellgren C.", "AuthorID": "37020689800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
