We examined middle ear function using tympanometry and measured cardiac pulse (CPA) and respiratory pulse pressure amplitudes (RPA) using the TMD analyzer.Results:We recruited 75 children (32 (43%) females; median age 3.3 (IQR: 2.0, 4.3) years). Twenty-one (28%) children died. Higher TMD measurements predicted death. Adjusting for diagnosis, every 50 nl rise in both semirecumbent and recumbent CPA was associated with increased odds of death associated with intracranial herniation (OR: 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07, 2.41; P = 0.02 and OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.66; P \u2264 0.01 respectively).Conclusion:Raised TMD pulse pressure measurements are associated with death and may be useful in detecting and monitoring risk of intracranial herniation and intracranial pressure in childhood coma.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Impedance Tests", "Blood Pressure", "Brain Diseases", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Coma", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Intracranial Pressure", "Kenya", "Malaria, Cerebral", "Male", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Observer Variation", "Time Factors", "Tympanic Membrane"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931846528", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"23767158400": {"Name": "Gwer S.", "AuthorID": "23767158400", "AffiliationID": "60119878", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research, Afya Research Africa"}, "55487100800": {"Name": "Kazungu M.", "AuthorID": "55487100800", "AffiliationID": "60070556, 60070343", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Geographic Medicine Research (Coast), Kenya Medical Research Institute"}, "23024198700": {"Name": "Chengo E.", "AuthorID": "23024198700", "AffiliationID": "60070556, 60070343", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Geographic Medicine Research (Coast), Kenya Medical Research Institute"}, "7801609356": {"Name": "Idro R.", "AuthorID": "7801609356", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Mulago Teaching Hospital, Makerere University"}, "35465836500": {"Name": "Newton C.R.", "AuthorID": "35465836500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "24802726700": {"Name": "Ohuma E.O.", "AuthorID": "24802726700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Oxford"}, "56692481900": {"Name": "Birch T.", "AuthorID": "56692481900", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Neurological Physics Group, Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, Southampton University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7004792990": {"Name": "Marchbanks R.", "AuthorID": "7004792990", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Neurological Physics Group, Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, Southampton University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Health, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
