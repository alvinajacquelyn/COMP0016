Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: The aim of this retrospective study was to quantify the level of dental developmental delay in a group of patients with Aperts syndrome when compared to matched controls. Methods: Twenty-six Dental Panoramic Tomographic (DPT) radiographs of patients with Apert syndrome attending Great Ormond Street Hospital were compared to controls (n = 29) from the Eastman Dental Hospital, UK. Dental development was assessed using the staging systems of Demirjian and Haavikko, and dental age (DA) was estimated using the weighted averages method. Results: Dental age, as estimated using the 12 stages of Haavikko and eight stages of Demirjian, suggested no statistical evidence of developmental delay between the Aperts and control group. Conclusions: The hypothesis 'that there is no difference in the dental development of subjects with Apert syndrome, when compared to a group of matched controls', was accepted.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acrocephalosyndactylia", "Age Determination by Teeth", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Odontogenesis", "Radiography, Panoramic", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922703788", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"56255736500": {"Name": "Woods E.", "AuthorID": "56255736500", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Hospital"}, "14010574900": {"Name": "Parekh S.", "AuthorID": "14010574900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "7405652171": {"Name": "Evans R.", "AuthorID": "7405652171", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004350944": {"Name": "Moles D.R.", "AuthorID": "7004350944", "AffiliationID": "60115301", "AffiliationName": "Peninsula Dental School"}, "7201959258": {"Name": "Gill D.", "AuthorID": "7201959258", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60013985, 60024544, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street NHS Foundation Trust and UCLH Eastman Dental Hospital"}}}
