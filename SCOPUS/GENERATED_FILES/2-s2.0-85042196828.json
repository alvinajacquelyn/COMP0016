This review systematically identifies studies reporting on formulation aspects of oral medications that affect their acceptability in these patient groups. Particular emphasis is placed on the evaluation of the methodologies employed in the studies. Sixty-eight studies were included for analysis, with 51 (75%) in children and 17 (25%) in older populations. The studies evaluated a range of oral formulations; however, the methodologies used differ considerably in participants\u2019 characteristics, study settings, tools, acceptability definitions and criteria. It is evident that there is a lack of standardisation in study design as well as the assessment methods used in assessing acceptability of medicines in children and older populations. This review presents a systematic analysis on methods employed for assessing acceptability of oral medicines in children and older adults, to provide insights and recommendations regarding the design of reliable instruments in future studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Aged", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Child", "Humans", "Medication Adherence", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042196828", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"6507365533": {"Name": "Ranmal S.R.", "AuthorID": "6507365533", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56435353000": {"Name": "Lopez F.", "AuthorID": "56435353000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57193742036": {"Name": "Orlu M.", "AuthorID": "57193742036", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "51161888000": {"Name": "O'Brien F.", "AuthorID": "51161888000", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "57190863906": {"Name": "Ruiz F.", "AuthorID": "57190863906", "AffiliationID": "119066717", "AffiliationName": "CLINSEARCH"}, "7404416719": {"Name": "Walsh J.", "AuthorID": "7404416719", "AffiliationID": "112876997", "AffiliationName": "Jenny Walsh Consulting Ltd, BioCity Nottingham"}, "57203362872": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57203362872", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
