Based on the importance of canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels in VEGF signaling, we firstly evaluated the expression of TRPC channels in mouse retina by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. All seven TRPC channels were expressed in mouse retina. TRPC4 channels were chosen for further analysis based on their upregulation on hypoxic retina according to the GEO database under the identifier GSE19886. Interestingly, TRPC4 suppression by intravitreal injection of siRNA against mTRPC4 significantly inhibited retinal neovascularization. To further investigate the effect of TRPC4 suppression on neovascularization, human retina microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) that are responsible for initiating neovascularization in response to increased VEGF in OIR retina were transfected with siRNA against TRPC4. As we have expected, suppression of TRPC4 effectively inhibited VEGF-induced migration and tube formation as well. Further evaluation on VEGF signaling pathway by western blot analysis of signaling molecules discovered that VEGF-induced activation of ERK, p38 MAPK and AKT signaling pathways were inhibited by suppression of TRPC4. These findings suggest that suppression of TRPC4 could be an alternative therapeutic option for VEGF-induced retinal neovascularization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Canonical transient receptor potential 4 channel", "Oxygen-induced retinopathy", "Retinal neovascularization", "Vascular endothelial growth factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Line", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Retina", "Retinal Neovascularization", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Signal Transduction", "TRPC Cation Channels", "Up-Regulation", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922945432", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55441538300": {"Name": "Song H.B.", "AuthorID": "55441538300", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University Graduate School"}, "22634399900": {"Name": "Jun H.O.", "AuthorID": "22634399900", "AffiliationID": "60021119", "AffiliationName": "Fight Against Angiogenesis-Related Blindness Laboratory, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital"}, "55720350300": {"Name": "Kim J.H.", "AuthorID": "55720350300", "AffiliationID": "60021119", "AffiliationName": "Fight Against Angiogenesis-Related Blindness Laboratory, Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul National University Hospital"}, "23985401900": {"Name": "Kim J.H.", "AuthorID": "23985401900", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, College of Medicine, Seoul National University"}, "57202026571": {"Name": "Fruttiger M.", "AuthorID": "57202026571", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}}}
