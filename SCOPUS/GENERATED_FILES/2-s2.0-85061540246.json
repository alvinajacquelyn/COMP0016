Whether this tension represents new physics or systematic effects is the subject of intense debate. Here, we investigate how new, independent H0 estimates can arbitrate this tension, assessing whether the measurements are consistent with being derived from the same model using the posterior predictive distribution (PPD). We show that, with existing data, the inverse distance ladder formed from BOSS baryon acoustic oscillation measurements and the Pantheon supernova sample yields an H0 posterior near identical to the Planck CMB measurement. The observed local distance ladder value is a very unlikely draw from the resulting PPD. Turning to the future, we find that a sample of \u223c50 binary neutron star \"standard sirens\" (detectable within the next decade) will be able to adjudicate between the local and CMB estimates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic oscillation", "Binary neutron stars", "Cosmic microwave backgrounds", "Cosmological modeling", "Hubble constant", "New physics", "Predictive distributions", "Systematic effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061540246", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"46461013400": {"Name": "Feeney S.M.", "AuthorID": "46461013400", "AffiliationID": "60105360", "AffiliationName": "Center for Computational Astrophysics, Flatiron Institute"}, "55155620200": {"Name": "Alsing J.", "AuthorID": "55155620200", "AffiliationID": "60105360", "AffiliationName": "Center for Computational Astrophysics, Flatiron Institute"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics, Stockholm University"}, "13905410800": {"Name": "Williamson A.R.", "AuthorID": "13905410800", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematics, Astrophysics and Particle Physics, Radboud University"}, "8912808400": {"Name": "Nissanke S.M.", "AuthorID": "8912808400", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematics, Astrophysics and Particle Physics, Radboud University"}, "7004828613": {"Name": "Mortlock D.J.", "AuthorID": "7004828613", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Stockholm University"}, "35185423600": {"Name": "Scolnic D.", "AuthorID": "35185423600", "AffiliationID": "60117873, 60029278", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, University of Chicago"}}}
