It also examined bi-directional associations between parents\u2019 expressed emotion constituents (parents\u2019 child-directed positive and critical comments) and children\u2019s emotional and behavioural problems. At time 1, the sample consisted of 160 families in which 50 mothers and 40 fathers had depression according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Children\u2019s mean age at Time 1 was 3.9 years (SD = 0.8). Families (n = 106) were followed up approximately 16 months later (Time 2). Expressed emotion constituents were assessed using the Preschool Five Minute Speech Sample. In total, 144 mothers and 158 fathers at Time 1 and 93 mothers and 105 fathers at Time 2 provided speech samples. Fathers\u2019 depressive symptoms were concurrently associated with more child emotional problems when mothers had higher levels of depressive symptoms. When controlling for important confounders (children\u2019s gender, baseline problems, mothers\u2019 depressive symptoms and parents\u2019 education and age), fathers\u2019 depressive symptoms independently predicted higher levels of emotional and behavioural problems in their children over time. There was limited evidence for a bi-directional relationship between fathers\u2019 positive comments and change in children\u2019s behavioural problems over time. Unexpectedly, there were no bi-directional associations between parents\u2019 critical comments and children\u2019s outcomes. We conclude that the study provides evidence to support a whole family approach to prevention and intervention strategies for children\u2019s mental health and parental depression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Behavior", "Depression", "Expressed Emotion", "Fathers", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Mothers", "Parents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031740761", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"22635632800": {"Name": "Psychogiou L.", "AuthorID": "22635632800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Exeter"}, "14039628700": {"Name": "Moberly N.", "AuthorID": "14039628700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Exeter"}, "56998338800": {"Name": "Parry E.", "AuthorID": "56998338800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Exeter"}, "57002424600": {"Name": "Nath S.", "AuthorID": "57002424600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London"}, "55000663400": {"Name": "Kallitsoglou A.", "AuthorID": "55000663400", "AffiliationID": "60026761", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Roehampton"}, "36020699200": {"Name": "Russell G.", "AuthorID": "36020699200", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}}}
