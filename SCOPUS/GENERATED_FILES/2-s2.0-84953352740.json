Therefore, the study presented here was conceived to depict the role of altered metabolism in PQ-induced Parkinson-like symptoms and to explore Drosophila as a potential model organism for such studies. Metabolic profile was generated in control and in flies that were fed PQ (5, 10, and 20 mM) in the diet for 12 and 24 h concurrent with assessment of indices of oxidative stress, dopaminergic neurodegeneration, and behavioral alteration. PQ was found to significantly alter 24 metabolites belonging to different biological pathways along with significant alterations in the above indices. In addition, PQ attenuated brain dopamine content in the exposed organism. The study demonstrates that PQ-induced alteration in the metabolites leads to oxidative stress and neurodegeneration in the exposed organism along with movement disorder, a phenotype typical of Parkinson-like symptoms. The study is relevant in the context of Drosophila and humans because similar alteration in the metabolic pathways has been observed in both PQ-exposed Drosophila and in postmortem samples of patients with Parkinsonism. Furthermore, this study provides advocacy towards the applicability of Drosophila as an alternate model organism for pre-screening of environmental chemicals for their neurodegenerative potential with altered metabolism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drosophila melanogaster", "Metabolomics", "Neurodegeneration", "Oxidative stress", "Parkinson\u2019s disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Brain", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Metabolome", "Metabolomics", "Motor Activity", "Nerve Degeneration", "Oxidative Stress", "Paraquat", "Parkinson Disease", "Principal Component Analysis", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953352740", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55574205762": {"Name": "Shukla A.", "AuthorID": "55574205762", "AffiliationID": "60101552", "AffiliationName": "Embryotoxicology Section, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (CSIR-IITR)"}, "42161924000": {"Name": "Pragya P.", "AuthorID": "42161924000", "AffiliationID": "60101552", "AffiliationName": "Embryotoxicology Section, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (CSIR-IITR)"}, "56148546200": {"Name": "Chaouhan H.", "AuthorID": "56148546200", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-IITR Campus"}, "6601985892": {"Name": "Chowdhuri D.", "AuthorID": "6601985892", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-IITR Campus"}, "55668250700": {"Name": "Ratnasekhar C.", "AuthorID": "55668250700", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-IITR Campus"}, "12041256600": {"Name": "Patel D.", "AuthorID": "12041256600", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-IITR Campus"}, "26537747200": {"Name": "Mudiam M.", "AuthorID": "26537747200", "AffiliationID": "60121522", "AffiliationName": "Academy of Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR-IITR Campus"}}}
