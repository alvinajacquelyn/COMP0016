All rights reserved.The unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has potential as a cell factory for the production of recombinant proteins and other compounds, but mainstream adoption has been hindered by a scarcity of genetic tools and a need to identify products that can be generated in a cost-effective manner. A promising strategy is to use algal chloroplasts as a site for synthesis of high value bioactive compounds such as diterpenoids since these are derived from metabolic building blocks that occur naturally within the organelle. However, synthesis of these complex plant metabolites requires the introduction of membrane-associated enzymes including cytochrome P450 enzymes (P450s). Here, we show that a gene (CYP79A1) encoding a model P450 can be introduced into the C. reinhardtii chloroplast genome using a simple transformation system. The gene is stably expressed and the P450 is efficiently targeted into chloroplast membranes by means of its endogenous N-terminal anchor domain, where it is active and accounts for 0.4% of total cell protein. These results provide proof of concept for the introduction of diterpenoid synthesis pathways into the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chlamydomonas", "Chloroplast transformation", "Cytochrome P450", "Diterpenoids", "Thylakoid membrane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Membrane", "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", "Chloroplasts", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System", "Diterpenes", "Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins", "Plant Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921517518", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"], ["Horticulture", "AGRI", "1108"]], "AuthorData": {"56453372000": {"Name": "Gangl D.", "AuthorID": "56453372000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Processing, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "56452699200": {"Name": "Zedler J.A.Z.", "AuthorID": "56452699200", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Processing, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "7403374944": {"Name": "Robinson C.", "AuthorID": "7403374944", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Processing, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "56490355000": {"Name": "W\u0142odarczyk A.", "AuthorID": "56490355000", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Plant Science Centre, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "7402088684": {"Name": "Jensen P.E.", "AuthorID": "7402088684", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Plant Science Centre, Department of Plant and Environmental Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "6701719502": {"Name": "Purton S.", "AuthorID": "6701719502", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
