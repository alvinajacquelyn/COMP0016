The preferred ligand for NK1R, substance P, is metabolised by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), which forms part of the brain renin angiotensin system (BRAS). In view of evidence that the BRAS modulates locomotor activity and cognitive performance, we tested the effects of drugs that target the BRAS on these behaviours in NK1R-/- and wildtype mice. We first tested the effects of the ACE inhibitor, captopril, on locomotor activity. Because there are well-established sex differences in both ADHD and ACE activity, we compared the effects of captopril in both male and female mice. Locomotor hyperactivity was evident in male NK1R-/- mice, only, and this was abolished by treatment with captopril. By contrast, male wildtypes and females of both genotypes were unaffected by ACE inhibition. We then investigated the effects of angiotensin AT<inf>1</inf> (losartan) and AT<inf>2</inf> (PD 123319) receptor antagonists on the locomotor activity of male NK1R-/- and wildtype mice. Both antagonists increased the locomotor activity of NK1R-/- mice, but neither affected the wildtypes. Finally, we tested the effects of captopril on the performance of male NK1R-/- and wildtype mice in the 5-choice serial reaction-time task (5-CSRTT) and found that ACE inhibition prevented the impulsivity of NK1R-/- mice. These results indicate that certain behaviours, disrupted in ADHD, are influenced by an interaction between the BRAS and NK1R, and suggest that ACE inhibitors could provide a novel treatment for this disorder.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADHD", "Angiotensin receptor", "Captopril", "Hyperactivity", "Impulsivity", "Neurokinin-1 receptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis of Variance", "Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor Blockers", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Animals", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Captopril", "Choice Behavior", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Hyperkinesis", "Imidazoles", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Motor Activity", "Pyridines", "Reaction Time", "Receptors, Neurokinin-1", "Sex Differentiation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928212918", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56379624200": {"Name": "Porter A.", "AuthorID": "56379624200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55371518000": {"Name": "Pillidge K.", "AuthorID": "55371518000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "42361220400": {"Name": "Grabowska E.", "AuthorID": "42361220400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55662869700": {"Name": "Stanford S.", "AuthorID": "55662869700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
