While the computational benefits of using prior expectation in perception are clear, there are myriad ways in which this computation can be realized. We review here recent advances in our understanding of the neural sources and targets of expectations in perception. Furthermore, we discuss Bayesian theories of perception that prescribe how an agent should integrate prior knowledge and sensory information, and investigate how current and future empirical data can inform and constrain computational frameworks that implement such probabilistic integration in perception.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian inference", "perception", "perceptual inference", "prediction", "predictive coding", "sensory processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian inference", "Computational framework", "Perceptual decision making", "perceptual inference", "Predictive coding", "Probabilistic integration", "Probabilistic structures", "Sensory processing", "Animals", "Anticipation, Psychological", "Brain", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049327101", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"8567604600": {"Name": "de Lange F.", "AuthorID": "8567604600", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University"}, "57191894457": {"Name": "Heilbron M.", "AuthorID": "57191894457", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour, Radboud University"}, "54401272500": {"Name": "Kok P.", "AuthorID": "54401272500", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Yale University"}}}
