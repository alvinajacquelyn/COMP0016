However, systemic actions of these agents cause sympathetic activation, which is generally considered to be detrimental in cardiovascular disease. Despite significant research interest in cardiovascular biology of GLP-1, the presence of GLP-1R in ventricular cardiomyocytes remains a controversial issue, and the effects of this peptide on the electrical properties of intact ventricular myocardium are unknown. We sought to determine the effects of GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (Ex4) on ventricular action potential duration (APD) and susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia in the rat heart in vivo and ex vivo. METHODS: Ventricular monophasic action potentials were recorded in anaesthetized (urethane) rats in vivo and isolated perfused rat hearts during sinus rhythm and ventricular pacing. RESULTS: In vivo, systemic administration of Ex4 (5 \u03bcg/kg intravenously) increased heart rate, and this effect was abolished by \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockade. Despite causing sympathetic activation, Ex4 increased APD at 90% repolarization during ventricular pacing by 7% ( P=0.044; n=6) and reversed the effect of \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist dobutamine on APD at 90% repolarization. In isolated perfused hearts, Ex4 (3 nmol/L) increased APD at 90% repolarization by 14% ( P=0.015; n=6) with no effect on heart rate. Ex4 also reduced ventricular arrhythmia inducibility in conditions of \u03b2-adrenoceptor stimulation with isoproterenol. Ex4 effects on APD and ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility were prevented in conditions of muscarinic receptor blockade or inhibition of nitric oxide synthase. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that GLP-1R activation effectively opposes the effects of \u03b2-adrenoceptor stimulation on cardiac ventricular excitability and reduces ventricular arrhythmic potential. The effect of GLP-1R activation on the ventricular myocardium is indirect, mediated by acetylcholine and nitric oxide and, therefore, can be explained by stimulation of cardiac parasympathetic (vagal) neurons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["action potentials", "cardiovascular diseases", "diabetes mellitus", "glucagon like peptide-1", "nitric oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcholine", "Action Potentials", "Adrenergic beta-Agonists", "Animals", "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Cardiac Pacing, Artificial", "Exenatide", "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor", "Heart Rate", "Heart Ventricles", "Incretins", "Isolated Heart Preparation", "Male", "Myocardial Contraction", "Nitric Oxide", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction", "Time Factors", "Ventricular Function"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055596447", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"37099632500": {"Name": "Ang R.", "AuthorID": "37099632500", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, United Kingdom (R.A., Q.A."}, "22956192000": {"Name": "Mastitskaya S.", "AuthorID": "22956192000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London, United Kingdom (R.A."}, "56118823200": {"Name": "Hosford P.", "AuthorID": "56118823200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London, United Kingdom (R.A."}, "55233650800": {"Name": "Basalay M.", "AuthorID": "55233650800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London, United Kingdom (R.A."}, "57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London, United Kingdom (R.A."}, "57174084400": {"Name": "Specterman M.", "AuthorID": "57174084400", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, United Kingdom (R.A., Q.A."}, "7004176082": {"Name": "Aziz Q.", "AuthorID": "7004176082", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, United Kingdom (R.A., Q.A."}, "57204442744": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57204442744", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, United Kingdom (R.A., Q.A."}, "7005427027": {"Name": "Tinker A.", "AuthorID": "7005427027", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, United Kingdom (R.A., Q.A."}, "26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, United Kingdom (M.O., P.T."}, "7006677172": {"Name": "Taggart P.", "AuthorID": "7006677172", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, United Kingdom (M.O., P.T."}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London, United Kingdom (M.O., P.T."}, "7004410902": {"Name": "Gourine A.", "AuthorID": "7004410902", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Karolinska Institute"}}}
