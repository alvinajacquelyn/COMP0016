We demonstrate a 3 \u00d7 3 Mueller polarimeter eigenvalue calibration method, inspired by those for full Mueller polarimeters. We also investigate the optimal combination of calibration measurements. Our method does not rely on modeling the polarization state generator, polarization state analyzer, or precise knowledge of calibration sample properties or orientations. It is therefore easy to implement, and the experimental results of a linear polarizer test sample, as well as a biological specimen, are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological specimens", "Calibration measurements", "Calibration samples", "Eigenvalue calibrations", "Mueller polarimetry", "Polarization state analyzer", "Polarization-state generators", "Tissue characterization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065465805", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"45761341500": {"Name": "Qi J.", "AuthorID": "45761341500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7005533698": {"Name": "Elson D.S.", "AuthorID": "7005533698", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}}}
