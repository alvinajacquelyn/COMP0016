Methods: Left atrial emptying function (LAEF), its clinical associations and prognostic value was studied in outpatients referred with suspected HF who were in sinus rhythm and had cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). Heart failure was defined as relevant symptoms and signs with either a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% or amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) >400 pg/mL (or >125 pg/mL if taking loop diuretics). Results: Of 982 patients, 664 fulfilled the HF criteria and were in sinus rhythm. The median (interquartile range, IQR) LAEF was 42 (31-51)% and 55 (48-61)% in patients with and without HF (P < 0.001). Patients with HF in the lowest quartile of LAEF (23%; IQR: 17-28%) had lower LV and right ventricular (RV) EF, and greater LV and RV mass and higher plasma NTproBNP than those in the highest quartile of LAEF (56%; IQR: 53-61%). Log[LAEF] and log[NTproBNP] were inversely correlated (r = -0.410, P < 0.001). During a median follow-up of 883 (IQR: 469-1626) days, 394 (59%) patients with HF died or were admitted with HF and 101 (15%) developed atrial fibrillation (AF). In a multivariable Cox model, increasing LAEF, but not LVEF, was independently associated with survival (HR for 10% change: 0.81 (95%CI: 0.73-0.90), P = <0.001). Increasing age and decreasing LAEF predicted incident AF. Conclusions: In patients with HF, LAEF predicts adverse outcome independently of other measures of cardiac dysfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging", "Heart failure", "Left atrial function", "Prognosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Atrial Function, Left", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Heart Failure", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Angiography", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Natriuretic Peptide, Brain", "Peptide Fragments", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Regression Analysis", "Stroke Volume"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940031541", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"35485204000": {"Name": "Pellicori P.", "AuthorID": "35485204000", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469, 60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull York Medical School (at University of Hull)"}, "35212799700": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "35212799700", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469, 60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull York Medical School (at University of Hull)"}, "57203083063": {"Name": "Lukaschuk E.", "AuthorID": "57203083063", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469, 60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull York Medical School (at University of Hull)"}, "55598161600": {"Name": "Joseph A.C.", "AuthorID": "55598161600", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469, 60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull York Medical School (at University of Hull)"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.V.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469, 60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull York Medical School (at University of Hull)"}, "8928536300": {"Name": "Loh H.", "AuthorID": "8928536300", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469, 60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull York Medical School (at University of Hull)"}, "22733292800": {"Name": "Bragadeesh T.", "AuthorID": "22733292800", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469, 60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull York Medical School (at University of Hull)"}, "56440635000": {"Name": "Clark A.L.", "AuthorID": "56440635000", "AffiliationID": "60107756, 60030469, 60025144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Castle Hill Hospital, Hull York Medical School (at University of Hull)"}, "7202164137": {"Name": "Cleland J.G.F.", "AuthorID": "7202164137", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals, Imperial College"}}}
