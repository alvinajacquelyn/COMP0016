Aims: This study investigated whether certain characteristics about patients influence the priority they are assigned for a scarce mental health treatment. Similar studies for physical treatments have found that young, poor, and mentally healthy patients are given the highest priority. Method: Each participant completed one questionnaire where they ranked a list of eight hypothetical patients in order of priority for treatment for anorexia or obesity. The patients varied on three dimensions: age, social class and mental health history. This involved a ranking of prioritisation for treatment. Results: Participants gave the young patients, from a low social class background, who had a mental health history the highest priority for treatment. This is in contrast to previous studies indicating that the mentally unwell are discriminated against. Conclusions: Participants seemed to be using social class as a proxy measure of ability to pay which they weighted very highly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anorexia", "ethics", "mental illness", "Obesity", "poverty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anorexia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Patient Selection", "Resource Allocation", "Social Stigma", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029412334", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57195636414": {"Name": "Gajre M.", "AuthorID": "57195636414", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Business School (BI)"}, "7004768888": {"Name": "McClelland A.", "AuthorID": "7004768888", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
