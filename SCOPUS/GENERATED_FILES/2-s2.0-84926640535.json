All rights reserved.So far six susceptibility loci for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). To identify additional RCC common risk loci, we performed a meta-analysis of published GWAS (totalling 2,215 cases and 8,566 controls of Western-European background) with imputation using 1000 Genomes Project and UK10K Project data as reference panels and followed up the most significant association signals [22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 3 indels in eight genomic regions] in 383 cases and 2,189 controls from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A combined analysis identified a promising susceptibility locus mapping to 1q24.1 marked by the imputed SNP rs3845536 (P<inf>combined</inf> =2.30\u00d710<sup>-8</sup>). Specifically, the signal maps to intron 4 of the ALDH9A1 gene (aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family, member A1). We further evaluated this potential signal in 2,461 cases and 5,081 controls from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) GWAS of RCC cases and controls from multiple European regions. In contrast to earlier findings no association was shown in the IARC series (P=0.94; P<inf>combined</inf>=2.73\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>). While variation at 1q24.1 represents a potential risk locus for RCC, future replication analyses are required to substantiate our observation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carcinoma, Renal Cell", "Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926640535", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55224880200": {"Name": "Henrion M.Y.R.", "AuthorID": "55224880200", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "15053139600": {"Name": "Broderick P.", "AuthorID": "15053139600", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "55224938800": {"Name": "Frampton M.", "AuthorID": "55224938800", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "34569730700": {"Name": "Houlston R.S.", "AuthorID": "34569730700", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "6701653966": {"Name": "Purdue M.P.", "AuthorID": "6701653966", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Department Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "34572851700": {"Name": "Rothman N.", "AuthorID": "34572851700", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Department Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "35346086300": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "35346086300", "AffiliationID": "60109509", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc."}, "7402281015": {"Name": "Chow W.H.", "AuthorID": "7402281015", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences, Department of Epidemiology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center"}, "7006558522": {"Name": "Albanes D.", "AuthorID": "7006558522", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Department Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "7006047196": {"Name": "Chanock S.", "AuthorID": "7006047196", "AffiliationID": "60013409, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Department Health and Human Services, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health"}, "7101982115": {"Name": "Ritchie A.", "AuthorID": "7101982115", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, Aviation House"}, "16835191900": {"Name": "Meade A.", "AuthorID": "16835191900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, Aviation House"}, "8762665400": {"Name": "Larkin J.", "AuthorID": "8762665400", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201568161": {"Name": "Stevens V.L.", "AuthorID": "57201568161", "AffiliationID": "60007161", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society"}, "8721972000": {"Name": "Diver W.R.", "AuthorID": "8721972000", "AffiliationID": "60007161", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology Research Program, American Cancer Society"}, "14324103000": {"Name": "Virtamo J.", "AuthorID": "14324103000", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chronic Disease Prevention, National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "57203050547": {"Name": "Eisen T.", "AuthorID": "57203050547", "AffiliationID": "60121116", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University Health Partners"}, "57212671682": {"Name": "Scelo G.", "AuthorID": "57212671682", "AffiliationID": "60024610", "AffiliationName": "International Agency for Research on Cancer"}, "57207381862": {"Name": "Li P.", "AuthorID": "57207381862", "AffiliationID": "60024610", "AffiliationName": "International Agency for Research on Cancer"}, "7201891825": {"Name": "McKay J.", "AuthorID": "7201891825", "AffiliationID": "60024610", "AffiliationName": "International Agency for Research on Cancer"}, "56447900600": {"Name": "Johansson M.", "AuthorID": "56447900600", "AffiliationID": "60024610", "AffiliationName": "International Agency for Research on Cancer"}, "57217586210": {"Name": "Brennan P.", "AuthorID": "57217586210", "AffiliationID": "60024610", "AffiliationName": "International Agency for Research on Cancer"}, "7006495387": {"Name": "Lathrop M.", "AuthorID": "7006495387", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill University, Genome Quebec Innovation Centre"}}}
