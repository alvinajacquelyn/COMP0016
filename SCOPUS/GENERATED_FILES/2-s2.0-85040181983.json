We present models for which such an approach gives completely misleading results: translationally invariant, local Hamiltonians on a square lattice with open boundary conditions and constant spectral gap, which have a classical product ground state for all system sizes smaller than a particular threshold size, but a ground state with topological degeneracy for all system sizes larger than this threshold. Starting from a minimal case with spins of dimension 6 and threshold lattice size 15 \u00d7 15, we show that the latter grows faster than any computable function with increasing local spin dimension. The resulting effect may be viewed as a unique type of quantum phase transition that is driven by the size of the system rather than by an external field or coupling strength. We prove that the construction is thermally robust, showing that these effects are in principle accessible to experimental observation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Condensed matter physics", "Finite-size effects", "Quantum phase transition", "Toric code", "Wang tiling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040181983", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55949605100": {"Name": "Bausch J.", "AuthorID": "55949605100", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Quantum Information and Foundations, Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "23768101300": {"Name": "Cubitt T.", "AuthorID": "23768101300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56585498300": {"Name": "Lucia A.", "AuthorID": "56585498300", "AffiliationID": "60017041, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Niels Bohr International Academy, Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen"}, "55909359400": {"Name": "Perez-Garcia D.", "AuthorID": "55909359400", "AffiliationID": "60103759", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Ciencias Matem\u00e1ticas"}, "7402497879": {"Name": "Wolf M.", "AuthorID": "7402497879", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}}}
