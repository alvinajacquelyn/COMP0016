It was recently demonstrated that the affective content of looming stimuli influences perceived TTC, with threatening objects judged as approaching sooner than non-threatening objects. Here, the neural mechanisms by which perceived threat modulates spatiotemporal perception were investigated. Participants judged the TTC of threatening (snakes, spiders) or non-threatening (butterflies, rabbits) stimuli, which expanded in size at a rate indicating one of five TTCs. Visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) and oscillatory neural responses measured with electroencephalography were analysed. The arrival time of threatening stimuli was underestimated compared with non-threatening stimuli, though an interaction suggested that this underestimation was not constant across TTCs. Further, both speed of approach and threat modulated both VEPs and oscillatory responses. Speed of approach modulated the N1 parietal and oscillations in the beta band. Threat modulated several VEP components (P1, N1 frontal, N1 occipital, early posterior negativity and late positive potential) and oscillations in the alpha and high gamma band. The results for the high gamma band suggest an interaction between these two factors. Previous evidence suggests that looming stimuli activate sensorimotor areas, even in the absence of an intended action. The current results show that threat disrupts the synchronization over the sensorimotor areas that are likely activated by the presentation of a looming stimulus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Emotion", "Oscillatory responses", "Time-to-collision", "Visual-evoked potential"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Waves", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Fear", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941051536", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55387437200": {"Name": "Vagnoni E.", "AuthorID": "55387437200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "15765869300": {"Name": "Longo M.R.", "AuthorID": "15765869300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "9941748800": {"Name": "Lourenco S.F.", "AuthorID": "9941748800", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Emory University"}}}
