In response, there has been a burgeoning interest in the role and involvement of local civil society in peacebuilding and development processes among academics and practitioners alike. The \u201clocal turn\u201d in peacebuilding and development research and practice notwithstanding, the accounts on the role, function, potential or activities of civil societies in peacebuilding processes seem to be largely detached from a considerable body of postcolonial literature that questions the appropriation of the concept of civil society in \u0149on-Western\u2019 environments. Against this backdrop, this chapter explores the consequences of applying a \u2018Westernized\u2019 and normative conception of civil society to sub-Saharan African post-conflict settings. It is divided into three main sections: The first part briefly discusses the term \u201ccivil society\u201d as it emerged as an idea in \u2018Western\u2019 philosophy and the history of political thought. The second part sheds light on the utility of the concept of civil society in \u0149on-Western\u2019 contexts with a special focus on sub-Saharan Africa. The third part then addresses the adverse effects of normativity when it comes to approaching the concept of civil society in postcolonial and post-conflict equatorial Africa. The central argument will be that civil society in post-conflict sub-Saharan Africa has to be regarded as an empirical and not purely normative concept to enable local societies to come to terms with a colonial, postcolonial and conflict-shattered past.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017586729", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"56786355800": {"Name": "Datzberger S.", "AuthorID": "56786355800", "AffiliationID": "60002483", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Geography Studies, Planning and International Development, University of Amsterdam"}}}
