This is most applicable to older individuals with CKD, the majority of whom have a creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 (CKD stage 3a). We sought to examine the utility of cystatin C as a confirmatory test of CKD across the age range in the general population of older adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of 5386 participants from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a cluster-sampled national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged \u226550 years. Cystatin C and creatinine were measured simultaneously using standardised assays. Using generalised additive models, we modelled the distributions of creatinine and cystatin C per year of age from four distributional parameters: location, dispersion, skewness, kurtosis. Among participants with CKD stage 3a, we estimated the predicted probability of cystatin C eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 ('confirmed CKD') as a function of age. RESULTS: Median age was 62 years, 53% were female and median cystatin C eGFR was 80 mL/min/1.73 m2. We observed progressive variability in cystatin C with increasing age. Compared with creatinine, cystatin C levels rose sharply beyond the age of 65. Among participants with CKD stage 3a (n=463), the predicted probability of 'confirmed CKD' increased steadily with age, from 15% at age 50 to 80% at age 80. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical utility of cystatin C may be maximised in middle-aged individuals, in whom the distribution of cystatin C is less variable than older adults, and the pretest probability of confirming CKD is lower.", "AuthorKeywords": [", Biostatistics", ", Epidemiology of chronic diseases", ", renaL", "Ageing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Distribution", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Biomarkers", "Creatinine", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Cystatin C", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Kidney", "Kidney Function Tests", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063966853", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6506149463": {"Name": "Canney M.", "AuthorID": "6506149463", "AffiliationID": "60120406", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Tallaght Hospital"}, "9243776400": {"Name": "Sexton D.J.", "AuthorID": "9243776400", "AffiliationID": "60120406", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Tallaght Hospital"}, "25958772300": {"Name": "O'Leary N.", "AuthorID": "25958772300", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing"}, "57214210019": {"Name": "Kenny R.A.", "AuthorID": "57214210019", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing"}, "26643059400": {"Name": "Little M.A.", "AuthorID": "26643059400", "AffiliationID": "60120406", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Tallaght Hospital"}, "23492739200": {"Name": "Healy M.", "AuthorID": "23492739200", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, St. James' Hospital"}, "11639106300": {"Name": "O'Seaghdha C.M.", "AuthorID": "11639106300", "AffiliationID": "60000718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Beaumont Hospital"}}}
