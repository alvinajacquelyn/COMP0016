Background: Alpha-synuclein aggregation is considered one of the main causes of Parkinson's Disease (PD). Malfunction of autophagy-lysosomal pathways is believed to be an underlying mechanism of \u03b1-synuclein aggregation. Although such malfunction has been observed in PD brains, it is unclear whether it may also occur in extraneuronal tissues. Objectives: To assess lysosome-mediated protein degradation in cultured Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of PD patients and healthy controls. Methods: Total protein degradation in cultured PBMCs was measured by labelling the cells with 3 H-leucine using pulse-chase experiments. Different inhibitors were used to measure a range of autophagic pathways. Results: Protein degradation through the main autophagic pathways is reduced in PD patients (n = 18) compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 18), (macroautophagy, p =.018; Chaperone-Mediated autophagy, p =.04; and total lysosomal function, p =.007). Conclusions: Lysosomal dysfunction is present in cultured PBMCs of PD patients, suggesting that it may reflect a systemic feature of the disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chaperone-mediated autophagy", "Lysosomes", "Macroautophagy", "Parkinson's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Case-Control Studies", "Cells, Cultured", "Chaperone-Mediated Autophagy", "Female", "Humans", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063950879", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57188849793": {"Name": "Papagiannakis N.", "AuthorID": "57188849793", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "12781377100": {"Name": "Xilouri M.", "AuthorID": "12781377100", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "12790281200": {"Name": "Maniati M.", "AuthorID": "12790281200", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "15834998200": {"Name": "Koros C.", "AuthorID": "15834998200", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56575103000": {"Name": "Simitsi A.", "AuthorID": "56575103000", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60007844, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "1st Department of Neurology, Eginition Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}}}
