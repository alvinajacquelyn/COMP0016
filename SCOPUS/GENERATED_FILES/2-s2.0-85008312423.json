Unfortunately, the first placebo-phase trial to assess the efficacy of RTX in refractory myositis did not show a significant difference between the two treatment groups, and doubts have been expressed about its study design. In this review we present an up-to-date overview of the reported experiences of RTX therapy in myositis. A PubMed search was performed to find all the available cases of refractory myositis patients treated with RTX up to July 2015. The following terms were assessed: inflammatory myopathies OR anti-synthetase syndrome OR polymyositis OR dermatomyositis AND RTX. A total of 48 studies were included. We identified 458 patients with myositis treated with RTX. We found a rate of response to RTX of 78.3%. RTX can play a role in the management of patients with myositis, at least in those with positive myositis-specific autoantibodies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-synthetase syndrome", "Dermatomyositis", "Inflammatory myopathies", "Polymyositis", "Rituximab"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Antinuclear", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Autoantibodies", "Autoantigens", "Dermatomyositis", "Humans", "Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex", "Myositis", "Polymyositis", "Rituximab", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008312423", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55927528700": {"Name": "Fasano S.", "AuthorID": "55927528700", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Second University of Naples"}, "7202833638": {"Name": "Gordon P.", "AuthorID": "7202833638", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, King's College Hospital"}, "56872737100": {"Name": "Hajji R.", "AuthorID": "56872737100", "AffiliationID": "113007922", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Sidi Bouzid Hospital, Ibn Aljazzar Medicine, Faculty of Sousse"}, "6507859551": {"Name": "Loyo E.", "AuthorID": "6507859551", "AffiliationID": "117924718", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Reumatolog\u00eda e Inmunolog\u00eda Clinica HRUJMCB, Jefe de Servicio"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.A.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University College London"}}}
