We do so by arguing that relativism and expressivism exemplify two very different approaches to context-dependence. Relativism, on the one hand, shares with other contemporary approaches a bottom-up, building block, model, while expressivism is part of a different tradition, one that might include Lewis' epistemic contextualism and Frege's content individuation, with which it shares an organic model to deal with context-dependence. The building-block model and the organic model, and thus relativism and expressivism, are set apart with the aid of a particular test: only the building-block model is compatible with the idea that there might be analytically equivalent, and yet different, propositions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment relativism", "Compositionality", "Context-dependence", "Expressivism", "Frege", "Pragmatism", "Principle of context"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949665606", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"26035437400": {"Name": "Fr\u00e1polli M.", "AuthorID": "26035437400", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy I, University of Granada"}, "55596830300": {"Name": "Villanueva N.", "AuthorID": "55596830300", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy I, University of Granada"}}}
