To explore the role identity aspects relating to smoking can play in smoking cessation and relapse, this study assessed the prospective associations between taking on a non-smoker identity following quitting and long-term abstinence. Methods: A representative sample of 574 ex-smokers in England who quit smoking in the past year was followed-up at three (N= 179) and six months (N= 163). Post-quit identity relating to smoking ('I still think of myself as a smoker' or 'I think of myself as a non-smoker'), and demographic and smoking-related characteristics were assessed at baseline. Self-reported smoking abstinence was assessed at follow-ups. Results: Non-smoker identity was reported by 80.3% (95%CI 76.8-83.4) of recent ex-smokers. Younger age (p= 0.017) and longer abstinence (p<. 0.001) were independently associated with a post-quit non-smoker identity. After adjusting for covariates, non-smoker identity (p= 0.032) and length of abstinence at baseline (p<. 0.001) were associated with continued abstinence at three month follow-up, and baseline length of abstinence (p= 0.003) predicted continued abstinence at six months. Conclusions: The majority of people who quit smoking recently consider themselves as non-smokers. Younger people and those who have been abstinent for longer are more likely to take on a non-smoker identity. Ex-smokers who make this mental transition following a quit attempt appear more likely to remain abstinent in the medium term than those who still think of themselves as smokers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ex-smokers", "Representative sample", "Smoker identity", "Smoking cessation", "Smoking Toolkit Study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Self Concept", "Smoking", "Smoking Cessation", "Social Identification", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931749921", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35575144500": {"Name": "Tombor I.", "AuthorID": "35575144500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "15123109500": {"Name": "Shahab L.", "AuthorID": "15123109500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "8231949800": {"Name": "Notley C.", "AuthorID": "8231949800", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia"}}}
