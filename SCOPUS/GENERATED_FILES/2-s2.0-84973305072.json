The reproducible positioning of the guest molecules within the unit cell has been documented. Analysis of guest-host and guest-guest interactions has shown the dominant role of \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 and CH\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions in the ability of the crystalline sponge to render the guest molecules regularly ordered. Further interactions specific to guest functionality, such as weak hydrogen bonds, are seen to contribute to the particular orientation of the guests.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aromatic guests", "Guest molecules", "Guest-host interactions", "Pi interactions", "Reproducibilities", "Simple aromatics", "Systematic study", "Weak hydrogen bond"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973305072", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57189593596": {"Name": "Hayes L.", "AuthorID": "57189593596", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24923462200": {"Name": "Knapp C.", "AuthorID": "24923462200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57189587850": {"Name": "Nathoo K.", "AuthorID": "57189587850", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006607053": {"Name": "Press N.", "AuthorID": "7006607053", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research"}}}
