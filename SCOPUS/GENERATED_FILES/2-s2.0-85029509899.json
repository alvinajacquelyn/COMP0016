Growing up after childhood surgery for urogenital anomalies can be real conflict. Reduced compliance with required regimens during puberty can be damaging in the long-term. Renal function is invisible and it is difficult to explain that damaged kidneys remain at risk. Coping with sexual function is often problematic as modern access to explicit images can give a very distorted view of normality. Clinicians must be careful to treat concerns on all these areas sensitively. This review examines these issues in detail. Surgery cannot achieve normality. We have to work with our pediatric patients as they become adults to establish realistic expectations and help them cope with insecurities and deficits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Congenital", "Pediatric", "Quality of life", "Sexual function", "Surgery", "Urogenital"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029509899", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"7404402006": {"Name": "Wood D.", "AuthorID": "7404402006", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Urology, University College Hospital"}}}
