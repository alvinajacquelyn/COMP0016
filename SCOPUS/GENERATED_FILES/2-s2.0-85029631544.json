Methods: HIV-infected patients enrolled in ICONA who were tested for HCV antibodies (HCV-Ab) were included. Results: Overall 3407 of 12 135 (28.1%) were HCV-Ab+; and 735 of 12 135 (6.1%) were HBsAg+. Among patients whose HCV genotype was known, the most represented were genotypes 1 and 3. The prevalence of HCV infection decreased from 49.2% (2565/5217) during 1997\u20132002 to 10.2% (556/5466) during 2009\u20132015. The frequency of genotype 1a increased from 29.0% (264/911) to 43.0% (129/300), whereas genotype 3 decreased from 38.5% (351/911) to 27.0% (81/300). Independent predictors of HCV-Ab+ status were being female (adjusted OR (AOR) 1.23, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.50, p = 0.01), risk category (versus injecting drug users: men who have sex with men AOR 0.01, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.01, p <0.001; heterosexuals AOR 0.01, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.01, p <0.001; other/unknown AOR 0.02, 95% CI 0.01\u20130.02, p <0.001), being cared for in Central Italy (versus being cared for in Northern Italy: AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73\u20130.98, p <0.001), being Italian-born (AOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.16\u20131.80, p = 0.001) and being enrolled in less recent calendar years (versus 1997\u20132002: 2009\u20132015 AOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.19\u20130.27, p <0.001; 2003\u20132008 AOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.41\u20130.61, p <0.001). Conclusions: The prevalence of HCV infection in HIV-infected patients entering into care in Italy significantly declined in more recent calendar years. After adjusting for risk factors and calendar years, HCV co-infection was more frequent in females and in those born in Italy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hepatitis C virus genotype distribution", "Hepatitis C virus prevalence", "Hepatitis C virus/human immunodeficiency virus co-infection", "Hepatitis C virus/human immunodeficiency virus co-infection Italian epidemiology", "Hepatitis C virus/human immunodeficiency virus co-infection predictors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Genotype", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029631544", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57208353568": {"Name": "Rossetti B.", "AuthorID": "57208353568", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases Clinic, Catholic University of Sacred Heart"}, "7201948233": {"Name": "De Luca A.", "AuthorID": "7201948233", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biotechnologies, University of Siena"}, "35097094900": {"Name": "Bai F.", "AuthorID": "35097094900", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan"}, "34572443100": {"Name": "Monforte A.d.A.", "AuthorID": "34572443100", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan"}, "56568414200": {"Name": "Tavelli A.", "AuthorID": "56568414200", "AffiliationID": "112757316", "AffiliationName": "ICONA Foundation"}, "57203947887": {"Name": "Galli M.", "AuthorID": "57203947887", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "University of Milan"}, "57203678052": {"Name": "Antinori A.", "AuthorID": "57203678052", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "INMI Spallanzani"}, "35378297800": {"Name": "Castelli F.", "AuthorID": "35378297800", "AffiliationID": "60015300, 60011918", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, University of Brescia and Brescia Spedali Civili General Hospital"}, "57213082459": {"Name": "Pellizzer G.", "AuthorID": "57213082459", "AffiliationID": "100327728", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases, Hospital of Vicenza"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London"}, "56539512900": {"Name": "Bonora S.", "AuthorID": "56539512900", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Infectious Diseases, University of Turin"}, "7004519792": {"Name": "Puoti M.", "AuthorID": "7004519792", "AffiliationID": "60007067", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Diseases, Maggiore Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
