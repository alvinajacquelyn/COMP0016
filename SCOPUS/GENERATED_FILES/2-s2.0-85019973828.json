We therefore examined the relationship between slow baseline gait speed (GS), change in GS, and the hazard of incident dementia in a community dwelling of elderly people. Methods: A total of 3,663 participants dementia-free at baseline (mean age, 73.5 years) were followed up for 9 years from a prospective cohort (Three-City study, France) for incident dementia (all-cause, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and other causes). GS over 6 m was assessed 4 times over the follow-up using two photoelectric cells. We used a multistate model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of dementia for baseline GS and tested a washout period of 4 to 7 years. The role of GS change between 65 and 85 years was examined using linear mixed models and joint models for survival and longitudinal data. Results: A total of 296 participants developed dementia during the follow-up. In age/sex-adjusted models, 1-SD (0.204 m/s) lower GS was associated with an increased hazard of dementia (HR = 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39, 1.81, p < .001), with associations evident when gait assessments were taken from 4 years (HR = 1.46; CI = 1.26, 1.68) and 7 years (HR=1.30; CI = 1.00, 1.70) prior to dementia onset. Independently of baseline GS, those with a steeper decline had a higher hazard of dementia (HR per 1 SD [0.007 m/s/year] decrease = 3.39 [1.37-8.43], p = .009). Conclusions: Gait is slower up to 7 years prior to clinical onset of dementia. Decline in GS is also more accelerated, suggesting strong links between cognitive and motor function in older adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Dementia", "Epidemiology", "Gait"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Dementia", "Female", "Gait Disorders, Neurologic", "Geriatric Assessment", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate", "Walking Speed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019973828", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"35242229200": {"Name": "Dumurgier J.", "AuthorID": "35242229200", "AffiliationID": "60019996, 60123796, 60123677, 60000905, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U942 and Memory Clinical Center, Saint Louis-Lariboisiere-Fernand Widal Hospital, AP-HP, University Paris Diderot"}, "54382845200": {"Name": "Artaud F.", "AuthorID": "54382845200", "AffiliationID": "60029937, 60106085, 60106017, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, Univ.
