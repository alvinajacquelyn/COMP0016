In experiment I, twelve adults and twelve 8-14 yr olds localized 1-5 sounds, all presented at the same location along a 34\u00b0 speaker array. Rate of gain in response precision (as a function of N observations) was used to measure integration efficiency. Children were no worse at localizing a single sound than adults, and - unexpectedly - were no less efficient at integrating information across observations. Experiment II repeated the task using a Reverse Correlation paradigm. The number of observations was fixed (N = 5), and the location of each sound was independently randomly jittered. Relative weights were computed for each observation interval. Distance from the ideal weight-vector was used to index integration efficiency. The data showed that children were significantly less efficient integrators than adults: only reaching adult-like performance by around 11 yrs. The developmental effect was small, however, relative to the amount of individual variability, with some younger children exhibiting greater efficiency than some adults. This work indicates that sensory integration continues to mature into late childhood, but that this development is relatively gradual.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Efficiency metrics", "Individual variability", "Integrating information", "Observation interval", "Reverse correlations", "Sensory integration", "Sound localization", "Spatial informations", "Acoustic Stimulation", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Hearing", "Humans", "Male", "Noise", "Sound", "Sound Localization", "Speech Perception", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049949989", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57079316000": {"Name": "Jones P.", "AuthorID": "57079316000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London (UCL)"}}}
