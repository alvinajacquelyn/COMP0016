This article argues that ?\u03bd is an inherited particle, and that the k-forms were the result of reanalysis of prevocalic \u03bf\u03ba and \u03f5\u03ba(i.e. \u03f5?\u03ba was reanalysed as \u03f5 \u03ba'), supported by the vestiges of an old topicalising/conditional force of the IE particle \u2217kwe (which appears elsewhere in Greek as connective \u03c4\u03f5). The attested forms in Greek grew out of \u2217kwe in contexts where an adjacent u caused the labiovelar \u2217kw > k (West Greek \u03ba? was influenced by indefinite \u2217kwa). The form \u03ba\u03f5\u03bd is a creation of epic diction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973321109", "SubjectAreas": [["Classics", "ARTS", "1205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"55892982000": {"Name": "Colvin S.", "AuthorID": "55892982000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
