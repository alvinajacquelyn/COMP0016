Schools and families need to be made aware of the signs and symptoms of OCD in order to facilitate access to treatment. Parents of children with OCD may require support as well as knowledge. This study evaluated two initiatives aimed at increasing knowledge and support for parents and teachers. Method: This study was carried out in two parts. First, to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of OCD, 266 schools in London were supplied with information packs. Knowledge of OCD was evaluated using a quiz before and after the dissemination of the packs. Second, groups of parents were given the opportunity to log into specially designed webinars that made it possible for them to learn about OCD and interact with other families. Feedback on webinars was collected through a survey. Results: Both the information packs and webinars were well received. One hundred and twenty seven teachers completed the quiz on OCD; knowledge of OCD increased after reading information packs. Twenty six parents attended webinars; parents reacted positively to being able to ask specialists questions and receive support from other families. Conclusion: Overall, the initiatives evaluated in this study appeared to lead to an increase in knowledge of OCD in teachers and provided access to further support for parents of children with OCD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Family support", "information packs", "OCD", "schools", "Webinars"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981294432", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6503937463": {"Name": "Jassi A.D.", "AuthorID": "6503937463", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Related Disorders Clinic, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Michael Rutter Centre, Maudsley Hospital"}, "56919593200": {"Name": "Kolvenbach S.", "AuthorID": "56919593200", "AffiliationID": "60013223, 60029445", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Minnesota"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College of London"}, "57190577951": {"Name": "Macleod T.", "AuthorID": "57190577951", "AffiliationID": "114380617", "AffiliationName": "OCD Action"}, "57190564559": {"Name": "Rose J.", "AuthorID": "57190564559", "AffiliationID": "114380617", "AffiliationName": "OCD Action"}, "56306555300": {"Name": "Diamond H.", "AuthorID": "56306555300", "AffiliationID": "60003400", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Therapies, Queen Victoria Hospital"}}}
