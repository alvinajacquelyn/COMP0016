The experiments reported here measure correlations on time scales from 4 \u03bcs to 2 ms. When the magnetic field is aligned in a direction such that spin-orbit coupling cannot cause spin flips, the correlation spectrum has prominent peaks centered at zero frequency and at the differences of the Larmor frequencies of the nuclei, on top of a frequency-independent background. When the spin-orbit field is relevant, there are additional peaks, centered at the frequencies of the individual species. A theoretical model which neglects the effects of high-frequency charge noise correctly predicts the positions of the observed peaks, and gives a reasonably accurate prediction of the size of the frequency-independent background, but gives peak areas that are larger than the observed areas by a factor of 2 or more. The observed peak widths are roughly consistent with predictions based on nuclear dephasing times of the order of 60 \u03bcs. However, there is extra weight at the lowest observed frequencies, which suggests the existence of residual correlations on the scale of 2 ms. We speculate on the source of these discrepancies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010716271", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"35111644400": {"Name": "Pal A.", "AuthorID": "35111644400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Rudolf Peierls Center for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford"}, "7005884122": {"Name": "Nichol J.", "AuthorID": "7005884122", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harvard University"}, "35204052900": {"Name": "Shulman M.", "AuthorID": "35204052900", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harvard University"}, "56729947600": {"Name": "Harvey S.", "AuthorID": "56729947600", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harvard University"}, "7006797648": {"Name": "Rashba E.", "AuthorID": "7006797648", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harvard University"}, "7004151737": {"Name": "Yacoby A.", "AuthorID": "7004151737", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harvard University"}, "56249345400": {"Name": "Halperin B.", "AuthorID": "56249345400", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Harvard University"}, "56473422100": {"Name": "Umansky V.", "AuthorID": "56473422100", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Braun Center for Submicron Research, Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Weizmann Institute of Science"}}}
