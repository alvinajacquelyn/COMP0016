Methods: A web-based survey comprising the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, an adapted version of the Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale, and questions about lived experience and anticipated likelihood of disclosure. Results: The survey was completed by 348 trainees across 19 UK training institutions. Sixty-seven percent reported lived experience of a mental health problem. For these trainees, there was no difference in anticipated likelihood of disclosing to different recipient types after controlling for maladaptive perfectionism. However, across all participants, anticipated disclosure was associated with maladaptive perfectionism, temporal proximity, anticipated stigma (past), and recipient type. Anticipated stigma (present) was not associated with anticipated disclosure. Conclusions: Results support an approach to communicating about mental health disclosure that incorporates responsibility, interdependency, and transparency. Suggestions for further research are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Perfectionism", "Psychotherapy", "Self Disclosure", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044442042", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"57201365592": {"Name": "Grice T.", "AuthorID": "57201365592", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57191991335": {"Name": "Alcock K.", "AuthorID": "57191991335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6507888355": {"Name": "Scior K.", "AuthorID": "6507888355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
