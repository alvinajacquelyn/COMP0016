The former is based on the mixed effects model by DerSimonian and Laird (Control Clin Trials 7:177-188, 1986), and the latter is currently based on four main methods, with the most known bivariate model and the hierarchical summary receiver operator curve model. Each type of meta-analysis needs to be investigated for sources of heterogeneity. Specialist software exist to help each type of analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bivariate model", "Diagnostic accuracy", "Meta-analysis", "Mixed effects model", "Trial"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063550319", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"36619772700": {"Name": "Tsagris M.", "AuthorID": "36619772700", "AffiliationID": "60001524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Crete"}, "56115678000": {"Name": "Fragkos K.C.", "AuthorID": "56115678000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
