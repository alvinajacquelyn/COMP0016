We developed the nanobody-display technology to restrict the tropism of lentiviral vectors (LVs) to APCs. However, we observed that immunization with APC-targeted LVs (DC2.1-LVs) did not evoke strong antigen-specific T-cell immunity when compared to immunization with broad tropism LVs (VSV.G-LVs). In this study, we report that VSV.G-LVs are more immunogenic than DC2.1-LVs because they transduce stromal cells, which has a role in activating antigen-specific T cells. Moreover, VSV.G-LVs trigger a pro-inflammatory innate immune response through transduction of APCs and stromal cells, while DC2.1-LVs trigger a type I interferon response with anti-viral capacity. These findings question the rationale of targeting LVs to APCs and argue for the development of VSV.G-LVs with an improved safety profile.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3T3 Cells", "Animals", "Antigen-Presenting Cells", "Female", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Immunity, Innate", "Interferon Type I", "Lentivirus", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019667288", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"54890771100": {"Name": "Goyvaerts C.", "AuthorID": "54890771100", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy (LMCT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)"}, "38461061500": {"Name": "De Vlaeminck Y.", "AuthorID": "38461061500", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy (LMCT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)"}, "16201827600": {"Name": "Breckpot K.", "AuthorID": "16201827600", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy (LMCT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB)"}, "6507259181": {"Name": "Escors D.", "AuthorID": "6507259181", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunomodulation"}, "6505895085": {"Name": "Lienenklaus S.", "AuthorID": "6505895085", "AffiliationID": "60024052", "AffiliationName": "Hannover Medical School, ZTL Imaging-Center"}, "8860386600": {"Name": "Keyaerts M.", "AuthorID": "8860386600", "AffiliationID": "60069985", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Department, UZ Brussel"}, "6701644152": {"Name": "Raes G.", "AuthorID": "6701644152", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, VUB"}}}
