In this paper, we propose a mesoscopic lattice-based model of angiogenesis, in which processes that include proliferation and cell movement are considered as stochastic events. By studying the dependence of the model on the lattice spacing and the number of cells involved, we are able to derive the deterministic continuum limit of our equations and compare it to similar existing models of angiogenesis. We further identify conditions under which the use of continuum models is justified, and others for which stochastic or discrete effects dominate. We also compare different stochastic models for the movement of endothelial tip cells which have the same macroscopic, deterministic behaviour, but lead to markedly different behaviour in terms of production of new vessel cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiogenesis", "Master equation", "Mesoscopic models", "Reaction\u2013diffusion system", "Stochastic models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Arteriovenous Anastomosis", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Chemotaxis", "Endothelial Cells", "Humans", "Mathematical Concepts", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Stochastic Processes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923882819", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"14819916600": {"Name": "Spill F.", "AuthorID": "14819916600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "OCCAM, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "7005568690": {"Name": "Byrne H.M.", "AuthorID": "7005568690", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"}, "16458078800": {"Name": "Guerrero P.", "AuthorID": "16458078800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55213301100": {"Name": "Alarcon T.", "AuthorID": "55213301100", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Matem\u00e0tiques, Universitat Aton\u00f2ma de Barcelona"}, "7007021673": {"Name": "Maini P.K.", "AuthorID": "7007021673", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}}}
