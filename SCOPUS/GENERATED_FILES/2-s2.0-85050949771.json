Whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies can enhance our understanding of the role of patients with asymptomatic Clostridium difficile colonization in transmission. Methods. Isolates obtained from patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and colonization identified in a study conducted during 2006-2007 at 6 Canadian hospitals underwent typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and WGS. Isolates from incident CDI cases not in the initial study were also sequenced where possible. Ward movement and typing data were combined to identify plausible donors for each CDI case, as defined by shared time and space within predefined limits. Proportions of plausible donors for CDI cases that were colonized, infected, or both were examined. Results. Five hundred fifty-four isolates were sequenced successfully, 353 from colonized patients and 201 from CDI cases. The NAP1/027/ST1 strain was the most common strain, found in 124 (62%) of infected and 92 (26%) of colonized patients. A donor with a plausible ward link was found for 81 CDI cases (40%) using WGS with a threshold of ?2 single nucleotide polymorphisms to determine relatedness. Sixty-five (32%) CDI cases could be linked to both infected and colonized donors. Exclusive linkages to infected and colonized donors were found for 28 (14%) and 12 (6%) CDI cases, respectively. Conclusions. Colonized patients contribute to transmission, but CDI cases are more likely linked to other infected patients than colonized patients in this cohort with high rates of the NAP1/027/ST1 strain, highlighting the importance of local prevalence of virulent strains in determining transmission dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CDI", "Clostridium difficile", "Colonization", "Whole genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier State", "Clostridium difficile", "Clostridium Infections", "Cross Infection", "DNA, Bacterial", "Genome, Bacterial", "Humans", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050949771", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56925914000": {"Name": "Kong L.Y.", "AuthorID": "56925914000", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Microbiology, McGill University Health Centre"}, "7004224827": {"Name": "Bourgault A.M.", "AuthorID": "7004224827", "AffiliationID": "60009657", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}, "14321838800": {"Name": "Loo V.G.", "AuthorID": "14321838800", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medical Microbiology, McGill University Health Centre"}, "36458191600": {"Name": "Eyre D.W.", "AuthorID": "36458191600", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7102132600": {"Name": "Crook D.W.", "AuthorID": "7102132600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7403910584": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "7403910584", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7004685939": {"Name": "Corbeil J.", "AuthorID": "7004685939", "AffiliationID": "60079127, 60032619", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherche CHUQ, Universit\u00e9 Laval"}, "8958052600": {"Name": "Raymond F.", "AuthorID": "8958052600", "AffiliationID": "60079127, 60032619", "AffiliationName": "Centre de Recherche CHUQ, Universit\u00e9 Laval"}, "55446626100": {"Name": "Wilcox M.H.", "AuthorID": "55446626100", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals, University of Leeds"}, "7005890917": {"Name": "Michaud S.", "AuthorID": "7005890917", "AffiliationID": "60011832", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Infectiology, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}, "57198089067": {"Name": "Frost E.", "AuthorID": "57198089067", "AffiliationID": "60011832", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Infectiology, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}, "7004927001": {"Name": "Toye B.", "AuthorID": "7004927001", "AffiliationID": "60085927, 60028897", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbiology, Ottawa Hospital, University of Ottawa"}, "6604062316": {"Name": "Dendukuri N.", "AuthorID": "6604062316", "AffiliationID": "121919035", "AffiliationName": "Technology Assessment Unit"}, "26027271000": {"Name": "Schiller I.", "AuthorID": "26027271000", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes Research, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre"}, "7004534250": {"Name": "Brassard P.", "AuthorID": "7004534250", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes Research, Research Institute, McGill University Health Centre"}, "57059485000": {"Name": "Dascal A.", "AuthorID": "57059485000", "AffiliationID": "60018916", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Jewish General Hospital"}, "7801551679": {"Name": "Oughton M.", "AuthorID": "7801551679", "AffiliationID": "60018916", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Jewish General Hospital"}, "25227366800": {"Name": "Longtin Y.", "AuthorID": "25227366800", "AffiliationID": "60018916", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, Jewish General Hospital"}, "16228413500": {"Name": "Poirier L.", "AuthorID": "16228413500", "AffiliationID": "60009022", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, H\u00f4pital Maisonneuve-Rosemont"}, "57213277307": {"Name": "Turgeon N.", "AuthorID": "57213277307", "AffiliationID": "60079128, 60079127", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Qu\u00e9bec, H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec"}, "16424523400": {"Name": "Gilca R.", "AuthorID": "16424523400", "AffiliationID": "106724926", "AffiliationName": "Qu\u00e9bec Institute of Public Health"}}}
