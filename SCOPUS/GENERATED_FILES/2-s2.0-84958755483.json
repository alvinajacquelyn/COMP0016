Data include not only the direct and indirect contribution of services to value added contained in a given country's exports, but also the extent to which third-country value added in services, through intermediate linkages of imported goods and services, is also embodied in production and trade. Our data indicate, in line with previous findings, that the ratio of value added to gross trade has been decreasing both for goods and for services, which is consistent with growing vertical production fragmentation. On the other hand, while value added in goods sectors including indirect exports is less than the gross value of exports, in services, it is greater, highlighting the service intensity of trade.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958755483", "SubjectAreas": [["Accounting", "BUSI", "1402"], ["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"55963863000": {"Name": "Francois J.", "AuthorID": "55963863000", "AffiliationID": "60020486, 60016621", "AffiliationName": "University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland and CEPR"}, "14031660000": {"Name": "Manchin M.", "AuthorID": "14031660000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57130967200": {"Name": "Tomberger P.", "AuthorID": "57130967200", "AffiliationID": "60021931", "AffiliationName": "Johannes Kepler Universit\u00e4t Linz"}}}
