Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the views and experiences of the first participants of the Self-Management in epILEpsy UK (SMILE UK) program to assist the development of a full trial. Method: In-depth semistructured interviews and group discussions were conducted with 10 people with poorly controlled epilepsy to explore their views and experiences of the self-management program. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed thematically. Results: All participants viewed the program positively. Three themes emerged: i) peer support was experienced through knowledge sharing, disclosure of experiences, and exchange of contact details; ii) participants felt better equipped to enter discussions with doctors and other health-care professionals about their condition; and iii) participants reported an improvement in their personal life through increased confidence to live with epilepsy and acceptance of their diagnosis. Conclusion: A brief group self-management intervention increased knowledge and confidence in managing epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epilepsy", "Long-term conditions", "MOSES", "Self-management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Chronic Disease", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Education as Topic", "Peer Group", "Personal Satisfaction", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Pilot Projects", "Quality of Life", "Self Care", "Social Support", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942514541", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"23477379100": {"Name": "Laybourne A.H.", "AuthorID": "23477379100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "56875161300": {"Name": "Watkins S.H.", "AuthorID": "56875161300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "35580592400": {"Name": "Lawton R.", "AuthorID": "35580592400", "AffiliationID": "60107268", "AffiliationName": "Hospital and Health Care, The London Clinic"}, "7005292091": {"Name": "Ridsdale L.", "AuthorID": "7005292091", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "57197790094": {"Name": "Goldstein L.H.", "AuthorID": "57197790094", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience"}, "7403025385": {"Name": "Morgan M.", "AuthorID": "7403025385", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Division of Health and Social Care Research, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine"}}}
