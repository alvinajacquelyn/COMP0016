Hydrogen storage capacity of the system was significantly improved to 0.91 wt% at room temperature and pressure of 0.8 MPa that is the highest hydrogen storage ever reported for graphene-based nanocomposites at room temperature and low pressures. Importantly, this nanocomposite exhibits \u223c91% capacity retention through 5 cycles with more than 88% release of the stored hydrogen at ambient conditions. Enhanced hydrogen uptake and capacity retention were attributed to the synergistic effect of i) reactive facets of TiO2, ii) high dispersion of nanoparticles with the average size of 6 nm, and iii) strong interaction between substrate and TiO2 nanoparticles through polarized C\u2013N bonding of N-rGO sheets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["(001) facet", "Graphene", "Hydrogen adsorption", "Nitrogen-doping", "TiO2"], "IndexKeywords": ["(001) facet", "Ambient conditions", "Hydrogen adsorption", "Hydrogen storage capacities", "Nitrogen-doping", "Solvothermal conditions", "Temperature and pressures", "TiO2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007321820", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"57188927072": {"Name": "Gohari-Bajestani Z.", "AuthorID": "57188927072", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Sabanci University, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences"}, "56717764100": {"Name": "Akhlaghi O.", "AuthorID": "56717764100", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Sabanci University, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences"}, "57208182816": {"Name": "Y\u00fcr\u00fcm Y.", "AuthorID": "57208182816", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Sabanci University, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences"}, "24081615800": {"Name": "Y\u00fcr\u00fcm A.", "AuthorID": "24081615800", "AffiliationID": "60008991", "AffiliationName": "Sabanci University, Nanotechnology Research and Application Center"}}}
