We report the observation of a structural transition from tubular-like carbon nanotube (CNT) morphology into planar few-layers graphite in experiments involving the pyrolysis of ferrocene and dichlorobenzene mixtures. An unusual intermediate curling-like mechanism in the walls of the as-grown CNTs is found when intermediate quantities of dichlorobenzene are used. This unusual phenomenon vanishes for high quantities of dichlorobenzene, where the nucleation of planar few-layers graphene-like structures directly connected to micrometer-scale Fe3C particles is found. Such morphological variation is investigated by means of both scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), whereas the structural variation of the obtained structures is analyzed through X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon nanotubes", "Curling effects", "Fe3C", "Graphene"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon Nanostructures", "Chemical vapor deposition methods", "Curling effects", "Fe3C", "Few layers graphene", "Morphological variation", "Structural transitions", "Structural variations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054264481", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55816684500": {"Name": "Boi F.", "AuthorID": "55816684500", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "SinoBritish Materials Research Institute, Sichuan University"}, "56456916900": {"Name": "Guo J.", "AuthorID": "56456916900", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "SinoBritish Materials Research Institute, Sichuan University"}, "56682011800": {"Name": "Medranda D.", "AuthorID": "56682011800", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "SinoBritish Materials Research Institute, Sichuan University"}, "37261080500": {"Name": "Borowiec J.", "AuthorID": "37261080500", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "SinoBritish Materials Research Institute, Sichuan University"}, "57201682046": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "57201682046", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "SinoBritish Materials Research Institute, Sichuan University"}, "57194289040": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57194289040", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "SinoBritish Materials Research Institute, Sichuan University"}, "36609251300": {"Name": "Xiang G.", "AuthorID": "36609251300", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "College of Physical Science and Technology, Sichuan University"}, "56228660700": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "56228660700", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University"}, "56486342400": {"Name": "He Y.", "AuthorID": "56486342400", "AffiliationID": "60016521", "AffiliationName": "Analytical and Testing Center, Sichuan University"}}}
