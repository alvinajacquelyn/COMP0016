The calculated solute descriptors mathematically describe the solubility behaviour of levetiracetam in methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, acetone, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, toluene and cyclohexane to within a standard error of 0.102 log units. Once calculated the Abraham model solute descriptors can be used to estimate the solubility of levetiracetam in more than 100 different organic solvents, as well as several important environmental and pharmaceutical properties, such as the lethal median molar concentration of levetiracetam towards various aquatic organisms and blood-to-body organ (or tissue) partition coefficients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham model solute descriptors", "And phrases: levetiracetam", "lethal median molar concentration", "solubility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abraham solvation parameter model", "Antiepileptic drugs", "Experimental solubility datum", "Levetiracetam", "Partition coefficient", "Pharmaceutical compounds", "Solute descriptors", "Standard errors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062441578", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57202911665": {"Name": "Yue D.", "AuthorID": "57202911665", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.E.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
