Methods: Blood count, red cell distribution width (RDW), percentage hypochromic red cells (%hypo), concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, plasma iron measurements and incidence of deletional forms of \u03b1-thalassaemia were determined. Results: Haemoglobin, mean cell haemoglobin (MCH), ferritin and CRP values classified iron status in 151/205 (73.6%) consecutive children aged 4-43 months. Fifty-four could not be classified: 12 were anaemic with findings, other than normal CRP values, indistinguishable from those with anaemia of inflammation and 42 were non-anaemic with reduced MCH values. All 42 had normal ferritin concentration and 8 of 36 successfully tested had deletional a-thalassaemia trait. Despite apparent iron sufficiency the RDW, %hypo and ZPP values of these 42 were not significantly different from the 32 children classified with iron-deficient erythropoiesis. The gene frequency of deletional a-thalassaemia trait in the entire group was 8.6%. Conclusions: Among 205 British South Asian children aged 4-43 months with high incidences of anaemia, iron deficiency, infection and a-thalassaemia, 151 (73.6%) were classified using haemoglobin, MCH, ferritin and CRP values. In 42 non-anaemic, ironsufficient children with subnormal MCH values, that is with a phenotype of a-thalassaemia trait, RDW, %hypo and ZPP values did not differ significantly from those with iron-deficient erythropoiesis. Raised RDW, %hypo and ZPP values should be interpreted with caution in non-anaemic young British South Asian children with microcytosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Thalassemia", "C-Reactive Protein", "Child, Preschool", "Erythrocyte Count", "Female", "Ferritins", "Hematologic Diseases", "Hemoglobins", "Humans", "Infant", "Iron", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942627100", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"7006330918": {"Name": "Hinchliffe R.F.", "AuthorID": "7006330918", "AffiliationID": "60008750", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Department of Human Metabolism, University of Sheffield, Medical School"}, "35430808700": {"Name": "Vora A.J.", "AuthorID": "35430808700", "AffiliationID": "60008750", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Child Health, Department of Human Metabolism, University of Sheffield, Medical School"}, "7004742950": {"Name": "Lennard L.", "AuthorID": "7004742950", "AffiliationID": "60008750", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Department of Human Metabolism, University of Sheffield, Medical School"}}}
