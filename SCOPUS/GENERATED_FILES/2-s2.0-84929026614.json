In Europe, the dominant arrangement for educational accountability is school inspections. The purpose of this research is to identify and analyse the ways in which school inspections in The Netherlands impact on the work of schools. The results of 2 years of survey data of principals and teachers in primary and secondary schools show that inspection primarily drives change indirectly, through encouraging certain developmental processes, rather than through more direct and coercive methods, such as schools reacting to inspection feedback. Specifically, results indicate that school inspections which set clear expectations on what constitutes \u201cgood education\u201d for schools and their stakeholders are strong determinants of improvement actions; principals and schools feel pressure to respond to these prompts and improve their education.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accountability", "school improvement", "school inspections"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929026614", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8283638900": {"Name": "Ehren M.", "AuthorID": "8283638900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}, "12141148500": {"Name": "Perryman J.", "AuthorID": "12141148500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}, "55951614200": {"Name": "Shackleton N.", "AuthorID": "55951614200", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
