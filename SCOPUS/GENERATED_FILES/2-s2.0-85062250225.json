IFN-\u03b2 is an established treatment for MS; however, up to 30% of IFN-\u03b2-treated MS patients develop neutralizing antidrug antibodies (nADA), leading to reduced drug bioactivity and efficacy. Mechanisms driving antidrug immunogenicity remain uncertain, and reliable biomarkers to predict immunogenicity development are lacking. Using high-throughput flow cytometry, NOTCH2 expression on CD14+ monocytes and increased frequency of proinflammatory monocyte subsets were identified as baseline predictors of nADA development in MS patients treated with IFN-\u03b2. The association of this monocyte profile with nADA development was validated in 2 independent cross-sectional MS patient cohorts and a prospective cohort followed before and after IFN-\u03b2 administration. Reduced monocyte NOTCH2 expression in nADA+ MS patients was associated with NOTCH2 activation measured by increased expression of Notch-responsive genes, polarization of monocytes toward a nonclassical phenotype, and increased proinflammatory IL-6 production. NOTCH2 activation was T cell dependent and was only triggered in the presence of serum from nADA+ patients. Thus, nADA development was driven by a proinflammatory environment that triggered activation of the NOTCH2 signaling pathway prior to first IFN-\u03b2 administration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Immunology", "Immunotherapy", "Monocytes", "Multiple sclerosis", "Neuroscience"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062250225", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"14521831200": {"Name": "Adriani M.", "AuthorID": "14521831200", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology"}, "35269482300": {"Name": "Mauri C.", "AuthorID": "35269482300", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology"}, "7006321323": {"Name": "Jury E.C.", "AuthorID": "7006321323", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology"}, "35311672200": {"Name": "Nytrova P.", "AuthorID": "35311672200", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Center for Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "6504019239": {"Name": "Medek K.", "AuthorID": "6504019239", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Center for Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "57199414195": {"Name": "Kubala Havrdova E.", "AuthorID": "57199414195", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Center for Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "55643499300": {"Name": "Mbogning C.", "AuthorID": "55643499300", "AffiliationID": "60106085, 60106017, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "CESP, Fac.
