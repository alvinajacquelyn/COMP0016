All rights reserved.Ecosystems have been modified by human activities for millennia, and insights about ecology and extinction risk based only on recent data are likely to be both incomplete and biased. We synthesize multiple long-term archives (over 250 archaeological and palaeontological sites dating from the early Holocene to the Ming Dynasty and over 4400 historical records) to reconstruct the spatio-temporal dynamics of Holocene-modern range change across China, a megadiverse country experiencing extensive current-day biodiversity loss, for 34 mammal species over three successive postglacial time intervals. Our combined zooarchaeological, palaeontological, historical and current-day datasets reveal that both phylogenetic and spatial patterns of extinction selectivity have varied through time in China, probably in response both to cumulative anthropogenic impacts (an \u2018extinction filter\u2019 associated with vulnerable species and accessible landscapes being affected earlier by human activities) and also to quantitative and qualitative changes in regional pressures. China has experienced few postglacial global specieslevel mammal extinctions, and most species retain over 50% of their maximum estimated Holocene range despite millennia of increasing regional human pressures, suggesting that the potential still exists for successful species conservation and ecosystem restoration. Data from long-term archives also demonstrate that herbivores have experienced more historical extinctions in China, and carnivores have until recently displayed greater resilience. Accurate assessment of patterns of biodiversity loss and the likely predictive power of current-day correlates of faunal vulnerability and resilience is dependent upon novel perspectives provided by long-term archives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "Extinction filter", "Historical archives", "Holocene", "Range loss"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Archaeology", "Biodiversity", "China", "Databases, Factual", "Extinction, Biological", "Mammals", "Paleontology", "Phylogeny"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035347491", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"8608216100": {"Name": "Turvey S.", "AuthorID": "8608216100", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "56094461100": {"Name": "Crees J.", "AuthorID": "56094461100", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "55707113700": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "55707113700", "AffiliationID": "60102421", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Zooarchaeology, Center of Archaeological Science, Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences"}, "57199894841": {"Name": "Yuan J.", "AuthorID": "57199894841", "AffiliationID": "60102421", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Zooarchaeology, Center of Archaeological Science, Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences"}, "6508080232": {"Name": "Bielby J.", "AuthorID": "6508080232", "AffiliationID": "60109277", "AffiliationName": "North of England Zoological Society"}}}
