Expression of pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptors and executioners of apoptosis are a prerequisite for TRAIL-based therapies as a promising future targeted therapy. Methods: Human meningioma tissues (. n=. 24 WHO grade I, n=. 7 WHO grade II, n=. 6 WHO grade III) were immunohistochemically analyzed for the expression of TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4, caspase-8, cFLIP, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, Bax, and Bak. Staining intensities were quantified by an automated software-based algorithm. Results: While TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R3 were nearly absent in meningiomas, TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R4 were abundantly expressed. However, only TRAIL-R4 expression correlated with the WHO grade of malignancy. Bcl-2 showed a non-significant upregulation in WHO grade III meningiomas. Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression was significantly higher in WHO grade II compared to grade I. Bcl-XL and TRAIL-R4 expression correlated with the mitotic activity (Ki67) of the tumor. Furthermore, TRAIL-R2 expression correlated with TRAIL-R4. Bak expression correlated with both, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression. The expression patterns did neither correlate with the progression-free nor with the overall survival of the meningioma patients. Conclusions: Apoptosis-inducing TRAIL-R2 and all key executioners of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway are abundantly expressed in meningioma. For some regulators of apoptosis with opposite functions, the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein significantly correlated with the expression level of the respective anti-apoptotic binding partner, possibly resulting in a steady-state of apoptosis. TRAIL-R2 might serve as a novel therapeutic target in meningioma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis regulators", "Immunohistochemistry", "Meningioma", "TRAIL-receptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Apoptosis", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Meningeal Neoplasms", "Meningioma", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand", "Tumor Markers, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940167162", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"8778263600": {"Name": "Koschny R.", "AuthorID": "8778263600", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "8754313500": {"Name": "Ganten T.M.", "AuthorID": "8754313500", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "6603396897": {"Name": "Krupp W.", "AuthorID": "6603396897", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Neurosurgery, University of Leipzig"}, "55798925200": {"Name": "Xu L.X.", "AuthorID": "55798925200", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Translational Centre for Regenerative Medicine (TRM) Leipzig, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leipzig"}, "56441062300": {"Name": "Holland H.", "AuthorID": "56441062300", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Translational Centre for Regenerative Medicine (TRM) Leipzig, Faculty of Medicine, University of Leipzig"}, "7402125108": {"Name": "Mueller W.C.", "AuthorID": "7402125108", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Neuropathology, University of Leipzig"}, "7401779431": {"Name": "Bauer M.", "AuthorID": "7401779431", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Neuropathology, University of Leipzig"}, "6602129438": {"Name": "Sinn P.", "AuthorID": "6602129438", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "56313149700": {"Name": "Keller M.", "AuthorID": "56313149700", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Cardiology, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "6603030704": {"Name": "Koschny T.", "AuthorID": "6603030704", "AffiliationID": "60008023, 60004354", "AffiliationName": "Ames Laboratory - US DOE, And Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University"}, "7003995251": {"Name": "Walczak H.", "AuthorID": "7003995251", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Death, Cancer and Inflammation (CCCI), UCL Cancer Institute"}, "34567844800": {"Name": "Bruckner T.", "AuthorID": "34567844800", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Biometry and Informatics, University of Heidelberg"}}}
