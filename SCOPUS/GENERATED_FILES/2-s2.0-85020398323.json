KGaA, WeinheimElemental phosphorus displays an impressive number of allotropes with highly diverse chemical and physical properties. White phosphorus has now been filled into single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) from the liquid and thereby stabilized against the highly exothermic reaction with atmospheric oxygen. The encapsulated tetraphosphorus molecules were visualized with transmission electron microscopy, but found to convert readily into chain structures inside the SWCNT \u201cnanoreactors\u201d. The energies of the possible chain structures were determined computationally, highlighting a delicate balance between the extent of polymerization and the SWCNT diameter. Experimentally, a single-stranded zig-zag chain of phosphorus atoms was observed, which is the lowest energy structure at small confinement diameters. These one-dimensional chains provide a glimpse into the very first steps of the transformation from white to red phosphorus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allotropy", "density functional calculations", "nanotubes", "phosphorus", "polymerization"], "IndexKeywords": ["allotropy", "Atmospheric oxygen", "Chain structure", "Chemical and physical properties", "Lowest energy structure", "One-dimensional chains", "Phosphorus atom", "White phosphorus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020398323", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57006133600": {"Name": "Hart M.", "AuthorID": "57006133600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "14062500300": {"Name": "Sella A.", "AuthorID": "14062500300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004272333": {"Name": "Salzmann C.G.", "AuthorID": "7004272333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56625502800": {"Name": "White E.R.", "AuthorID": "56625502800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.S.P.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "55642062800": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "55642062800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "12805042500": {"Name": "McGilvery C.M.", "AuthorID": "12805042500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "7006725779": {"Name": "Pickard C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006725779", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}}}
