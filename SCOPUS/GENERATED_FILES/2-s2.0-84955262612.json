Hughes, Lin Ma, Richard Porter, and Mohamed Pourkashanian All Rights Reserved.The prospects of UK shale gas development and its role in the energy mix has generated contradictory views. Its inclusion in electricity generation is anticipated to help mitigate the grid carbon emissions. However, there is fear that a shale gas \u201crevolution\u201d might distract policy commitments on the development of low carbon technologies. Others argue that a shale gas \u201cboom\u201d could potentially create a \u201clock-in-effect\u201d on the gas generation infrastructure, thus, further exacerbating the burden on carbon emissions. The uncertainty over the future role of shale gas is worsened by lack of clarity and conflicting estimates on the potential gas resource and reserves. In the midst of these uncertainties, this paper seeks to examine transition pathways incorporating shale gas and their implications on electricity sector decarbonisation and energy security objectives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon capture and storage", "Decarbonisation", "Energy scenarios", "Low-carbon technologies", "Unconventional gas"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955262612", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"57073688300": {"Name": "Sithole H.", "AuthorID": "57073688300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "The University of Sheffield"}, "7202448730": {"Name": "Hughes K.J.", "AuthorID": "7202448730", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "The University of Sheffield"}, "56727012700": {"Name": "Ma L.", "AuthorID": "56727012700", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "The University of Sheffield"}, "7004225021": {"Name": "Pourkashanian M.", "AuthorID": "7004225021", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "The University of Sheffield"}, "23003466700": {"Name": "Cockerill T.", "AuthorID": "23003466700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}, "56147835100": {"Name": "Edmunds R.", "AuthorID": "56147835100", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}, "8311065900": {"Name": "Porter R.", "AuthorID": "8311065900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}}}
