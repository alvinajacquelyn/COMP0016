Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.We describe a uniform logical framework, based on a bunched logic that combines classical additives and very weak multiplicatives, for reasoning compositionally about access control policy models. We show how our approach takes account of the underlying system architecture, and so provides a way to identify and reason about how vulnerabilities may arise (and be removed) as a result of the architecture of the system. We consider, using frame rules, how local properties of access control policies are maintained as the system architecture evolves.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Access control", "Layered graphs", "Modelling", "Substructural logic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Access control policies", "Assertion language", "Classical additives", "Layered graphs", "Logical frameworks", "Substructural logic", "System architectures", "Underlying systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014685040", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Logic", "MATH", "2609"]], "AuthorData": {"8951820300": {"Name": "Collinson M.", "AuthorID": "8951820300", "AffiliationID": "60015875, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Computing Science, University of Aberdeen, King's College"}, "56301299300": {"Name": "Mcdonald K.", "AuthorID": "56301299300", "AffiliationID": "60015875, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Computing Science, University of Aberdeen, King's College"}, "57207511534": {"Name": "Pym D.", "AuthorID": "57207511534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Department of Computer Science"}}}
