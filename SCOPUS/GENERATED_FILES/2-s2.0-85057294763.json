Narratives are represented in the form of sentiment that online news sources express about various topics. Our results suggest that there is evidence of specific news sources acting as opinion leaders, determining the narratives that others in the online media adopt.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conviction narrative theory", "decision-making", "intermedia agenda-setting", "opinion leader", "sentiment-topic modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agenda settings", "Narrative theory", "News media", "News sources", "Online media", "Online news", "Opinion leaders", "Topic modelling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057294763", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"57204813455": {"Name": "Stern S.", "AuthorID": "57204813455", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55727407500": {"Name": "Smith R.", "AuthorID": "55727407500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6602003712": {"Name": "Tuckett D.", "AuthorID": "6602003712", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Decision-Making Uncertainty, University College London"}, "56001753900": {"Name": "Nyman R.", "AuthorID": "56001753900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Decision-Making Uncertainty, University College London"}}}
