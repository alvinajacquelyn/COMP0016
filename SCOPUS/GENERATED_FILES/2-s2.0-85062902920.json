However, developing a biorefinery OTS is a complex engineering design activity that requires a structured technique. This paper presents a structured methodology that applies design frameworks from other disciplines and a user-centred approach for biorefinery OTS design. These include the definition of end user requirements (operator training needs), and the analysis of these requirements using Quality Function Deployment (QFD). Furthermore, an algorithm for bioprocess optimisation and automatic adjustment of operating parameters is developed for integration into the OTS. This algorithm is based on the Nelder-Mead simplex method for multi-dimensional function minimisation. Identified user requirements were categorized into primary, secondary and tertiary training needs, with increasing levels of detail from primary to tertiary needs. The relationships between identified operator training needs and OTS technical and functional specifications were investigated, and a priority rating assigned to the most important OTS specifications. Identified OTS specifications were evaluated for robustness to ensure that important features were not omitted from the final design. .", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic adjustment", "End user requirements", "Engineering frameworks", "Functional specification", "Multidimensional function", "Nelder-Mead simplex methods", "Operator training simulator", "Quality function deployments (QFD)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062902920", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"56394514200": {"Name": "Isimite J.", "AuthorID": "56394514200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603502108": {"Name": "Baganz F.", "AuthorID": "6603502108", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55881526500": {"Name": "Hass V.", "AuthorID": "55881526500", "AffiliationID": "60078281", "AffiliationName": "Furtwangen University"}}}
