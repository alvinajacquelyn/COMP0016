Results are presented for SiO, CaH, AlO, ScH, H2O and methane. The results for CH4 are particularly unusual with four excited states with no dipole-allowed decay route and several others, where these decays lead to exceptionally long lifetimes. These lifetime data should be useful in models of masers and estimates of critical densities, and can provide a link with laboratory measurements. Cooling functions are important in stellar and planet formation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["intensities", "molecular processes", "molecular spectra", "radiation mechanisms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dipole-allowed transitions", "intensities", "Laboratory measurements", "Molecular process", "Molecular spectra", "Radiation mechanism", "Radiative lifetime", "Temperature dependent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958211723", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57117596100": {"Name": "Hulme K.", "AuthorID": "57117596100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57117953100": {"Name": "Naim O.", "AuthorID": "57117953100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
