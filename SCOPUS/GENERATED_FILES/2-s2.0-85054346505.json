We showed that replicative aging in this cell culture model leads to a mitotic arrest at the spindle assembly checkpoint. Here we show that this arrest is due to a reduction in microtubule anchoring that coincides with decreased expression of the BUB1 kinase and of the phosphorylated form of its substrate, BUB3. The ensuing prolonged mitotic arrest leads to cohesion fatigue resulting in cell death or, in cells that recover from this arrest, in cytokinesis failure and polyploidy. Down-regulation of BRCA1 to levels similar to those present in BRCA1 mutation carriers leads to increased and uncontrolled microtubule anchoring to the kinetochore resulting in overcoming the spindle assembly checkpoint. Progression to anaphase under those conditions is associated with formation of chromatin bridges between chromosomal plates due to abnormal attachments to the kinetochore, significantly increasing the risk of cytokinesis failure. The dependence of this scenario on accelerated replicative aging can, at least in part, account for the site specificity of the cancers associated with the BRCA1 mutation carrier state, as epithelia of the mammary gland and of the reproductive tract are targets of cell-nonautonomous consequences of this carrier state on cellular proliferation associated with menstrual cycle progressions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aneuploidy", "BRCA1", "cytokinesis failure", "ovarian carcinoma", "P53"], "IndexKeywords": ["BRCA1 Protein", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Chromosomes", "Cystadenoma", "Cytokinesis", "Female", "Humans", "Microtubules", "Mitosis", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Polyploidy", "Signal Transduction", "Spindle Apparatus", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054346505", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"48661726700": {"Name": "Austria T.", "AuthorID": "48661726700", "AffiliationID": "60022143, 60029311, 60015183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "48662527500": {"Name": "Marion C.", "AuthorID": "48662527500", "AffiliationID": "60022143, 60029311, 60015183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "48663246200": {"Name": "Yu V.", "AuthorID": "48663246200", "AffiliationID": "60022143, 60029311, 60015183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "7004813197": {"Name": "Dubeau L.", "AuthorID": "7004813197", "AffiliationID": "60022143, 60029311, 60015183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, UCL Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57220540338": {"Name": "Hinton D.R.", "AuthorID": "57220540338", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Ophthalmology, Roski Institute, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}}}
