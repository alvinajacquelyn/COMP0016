Meta-analyses of mainly cross-sectional studies confirm that low individual/household income is associated with oral cancer (odds ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.59\u20133.65), dental caries prevalence (prevalence ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18\u20131.41), any caries experience (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.19\u20131.65), tooth loss (odds ratio, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.48\u20131.86), and traumatic dental injuries (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65\u20130.89). Reviews also confirm qualitatively that low income is associated with periodontal disease and poor oral health\u2013related quality of life. Limited evidence from the United States shows that psychosocial and behavioral explanations only partially explain associations between low individual/household income and oral health. Few country-level studies and a handful of subnational studies from the United States, Japan, and Brazil show associations between area-level income inequality and poor oral health. However, this evidence is conflicting given that the association between area-level income inequality and oral health outcomes varies considerably by contexts and by oral health outcomes. Evidence also shows cross-national variations in income-related inequalities in oral health outcomes of self-rated oral health, dental care, oral health\u2013related quality of life, outcomes of dental caries, and outcomes of tooth loss. There is a lack of discussion in oral health literature about limitations of using income as a measure of social position. Future studies on the relationship between income and oral health can benefit substantially from recent theoretical and methodological advancements in social epidemiology that include application of an intersectionality framework, improvements in reporting of inequality, and causal modeling approaches. Theoretically well-informed studies that apply robust epidemiological methods are required to address knowledge gaps for designing relevant policy interventions to reduce income-related inequalities in oral health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dental", "epidemiology", "health inequalities", "social determinants", "socioeconomic factors", "theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brazil", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dental Caries", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Income", "Japan", "Oral Health", "Periodontal Diseases", "Quality of Life", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Tooth Loss", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067863295", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57203296061": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "57203296061", "AffiliationID": "60118547, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Equity, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne"}, "55930551500": {"Name": "Peres M.A.", "AuthorID": "55930551500", "AffiliationID": "60032987, 60189943, 60190629", "AffiliationName": "Menzies Health Institute Queensland, School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
