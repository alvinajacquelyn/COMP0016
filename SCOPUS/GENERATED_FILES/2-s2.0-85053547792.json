Reversible mutism is the hallmark of a syndrome which comprises severe motor, cognitive and linguistic deficits. Recent evidence from advanced neuroimaging studies has led to the current theoretical understanding of the condition as a form of diaschisis contingent on damage to efferent cerebellar circuitry. Tractography data derived from diffusion MRI studies have shown disruption of the dentato-rubro-thalamo-cortical tract in patients with pCMS, and perfusion studies have indicated widespread supratentorial regions which may give rise to the florid signs and symptoms of pCMS. Given the difficulties in predicting pCMS from standard structural MRI, this review discusses findings from quantitative MRI modalities which have contributed to our understanding of this debilitating syndrome, and considers the goals and challenges which lie ahead in the field.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial spin labelling", "Cerebellar mutism", "Medulloblastoma", "Posterior fossa syndrome", "Tractography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebellar Diseases", "Cerebellar Neoplasms", "Cerebellum", "Child", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Medulloblastoma", "Mutism", "Neuroimaging", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Postoperative Care", "Postoperative Complications", "Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053547792", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55892641800": {"Name": "Toescu S.M.", "AuthorID": "55892641800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6701651127": {"Name": "Hales P.W.", "AuthorID": "6701651127", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging and Biophysics Section, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging and Biophysics Section, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "56255711900": {"Name": "Aquilina K.", "AuthorID": "56255711900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
