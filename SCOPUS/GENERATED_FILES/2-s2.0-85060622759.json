The voids in the antifluorite structure that are crucial for superionicity in Li2O might also act as atomic traps. Trapping of guest atoms and small molecules within voids of a host structure leads to the formation of what are known as clathrate compounds. Here we investigate the possibility of trapping helium or larger neon guest atoms under pressure within alkali-metal oxide and sulfide structures. We find stable helium and neon-bearing compounds at very low pressures. These structures are stabilized by a reduction in volume from incorporation of helium or neon atoms within the antifluorite structure. We predict that NeCs2S could be stable at ambient pressure. Our study suggests a novel class of alkali oxide and sulfide materials incorporating noble-gas atoms that might potentially be useful for gas storage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkali metal oxides", "Alkali sulfide", "Ambient pressures", "Clathrate compound", "Host structure", "Noble gas atoms", "Small molecules", "Tetrahedral sites"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060622759", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57192701366": {"Name": "Gao H.", "AuthorID": "57192701366", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "56698917600": {"Name": "Sun J.", "AuthorID": "56698917600", "AffiliationID": "60033100, 60073598", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Solid State Microstructures, School of Physics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University"}, "7006725779": {"Name": "Pickard C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006725779", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University"}, "7003406428": {"Name": "Needs R.J.", "AuthorID": "7003406428", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Theory of Condensed Matter Group, Cavendish Laboratory"}}}
