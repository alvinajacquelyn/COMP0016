Anterior segment dysgenesis arises due to developmental anomalies and may be associated with systemic disease, as in Rieger syndrome. Case report: A 49-year-old woman presented with longstanding reduction in vision, evidence of anterior segment dysgenesis, and multiple discrete pigmented lesions throughout the macula bilaterally. Electroretinographic findings were consistent with severe macular dysfunction. Gene array analysis did not reveal any chromosomal imbalances or other specific abnormalities. Conclusions: This is a unique case of bilateral pigmentary maculopathy and anterior segment dysgenesis, with clinical findings that are not characteristic of previously reported disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eye diseases", "Fundus dystrophies", "Hereditary maculopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anterior Eye Segment", "Electroretinography", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Eye Abnormalities", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Retina", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046860664", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"54402255500": {"Name": "Bloch E.", "AuthorID": "54402255500", "AffiliationID": "60029685, 60030831", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Queen Mary\u2019s Hospital, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23994288800": {"Name": "Pefkianaki M.", "AuthorID": "23994288800", "AffiliationID": "60026404", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Oncology Service, Wills Eye Hospital"}, "57033760300": {"Name": "Hakim J.", "AuthorID": "57033760300", "AffiliationID": "60029685, 60030831", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Queen Mary\u2019s Hospital, King\u2019s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
