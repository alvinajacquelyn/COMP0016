Karger AG, Basel.Background: Souvenaid\u2122 is a nutraceutical compound thought to positively enhance synaptic function. In line with this mechanism of action, Souvenaid\u2122 has been shown to improve cognitive function in subjects with mild Alzheimer's disease in randomized clinical trials. To date, however, the potential of Souvenaid\u2122 to improve cognitive functioning in subjects with other neurodegenerative conditions also characterized by synaptic loss has not been explored. Objective: To evaluate the impact of Souvenaid\u2122 on executive functions, social cognition and behavioral disturbances in subjects with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD). Methods: Twenty-six subjects with bv-FTD were enrolled in the study and randomized to Souvenaid\u2122 (125 ml/day) or placebo groups. After 12 weeks, subjects were switched between the two groups. All subjects, blinded to treatment, underwent clinical and cognitive evaluations at enrollment, after 12 weeks and after 24 weeks. Results: Treatment with Souvenaid\u2122 was associated with a significant reduction of behavioral symptoms and an increase in Theory of Mind skills compared to placebo, which both returned to baseline when Souvenaid\u2122 was discontinued. Souvenaid\u2122 did not have an effect on executive functions. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of the potential of Souvenaid\u2122 therapy for the treatment of behavioral disturbances and social cognition skills in FTD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioral deficits", "Fronto-temporal dementia", "Medical foods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Choline", "Cognition", "Dietary Supplements", "Docosahexaenoic Acids", "Eicosapentaenoic Acid", "Executive Function", "Female", "Folic Acid", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Selenium", "Social Skills", "Synapses", "Treatment Outcome", "Uridine Monophosphate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924270317", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"23493507300": {"Name": "Pardini M.", "AuthorID": "23493507300", "AffiliationID": "107951411", "AffiliationName": "Center for Communication and Neurorehabilitation Research-CNAPP"}, "55388705400": {"Name": "Abate L.", "AuthorID": "55388705400", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology Genetics and Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa"}, "56026105600": {"Name": "Massucco D.", "AuthorID": "56026105600", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology Genetics and Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa"}, "55607647300": {"Name": "Sassos D.", "AuthorID": "55607647300", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology Genetics and Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa"}, "7003284391": {"Name": "Amore M.", "AuthorID": "7003284391", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology Genetics and Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa"}, "7006227906": {"Name": "Cocito L.", "AuthorID": "7006227906", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology Genetics and Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa"}, "6508341678": {"Name": "Emberti Gialloreti L.", "AuthorID": "6508341678", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome 'Tor Vergata'"}, "6602540528": {"Name": "Serrati C.", "AuthorID": "6602540528", "AffiliationID": "60107402, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, IRCCS IST S.
