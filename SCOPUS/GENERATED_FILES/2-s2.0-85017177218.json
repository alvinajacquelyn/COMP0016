Pyrroles were synthesized by exploiting the previously unexplored aromatizing activity of monoamine oxidase enzymes (MAO-N and 6-HDNO). MAO-N/6-HDNO whole cell biocatalysts are able to convert 3-pyrrolines into pyrroles under mild conditions and in high yields. Moreover, MAO-N can work in combination with the ruthenium Grubbs catalyst, leading to the synthesis of pyrroles from diallylamines/-anilines in a one-pot cascade metathesis-aromatization sequence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biocatalysis", "chemoenzymatic cascade", "MAO-N", "metathesis", "pyrrole"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biocatalysis", "Cascade process", "Grubbs catalysts", "metathesis", "Monoamine oxidase", "pyrrole", "Sustainable production", "Whole cell biocatalysts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017177218", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56651010800": {"Name": "Scalacci N.", "AuthorID": "56651010800", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "57217255126": {"Name": "Mattedi G.", "AuthorID": "57217255126", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "8694698600": {"Name": "Castagnolo D.", "AuthorID": "8694698600", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "7102294180": {"Name": "Black G.W.", "AuthorID": "7102294180", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "56513074700": {"Name": "Brown N.L.", "AuthorID": "56513074700", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Sciences, Northumbria University"}, "7202573140": {"Name": "Turner N.J.", "AuthorID": "7202573140", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, University of Manchester"}}}
