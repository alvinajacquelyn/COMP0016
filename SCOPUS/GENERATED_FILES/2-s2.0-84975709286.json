The behaviour of Pn for a spherically convex set K contained in an open halfsphere is quite similar to that of a similarly generated random convex polytope in a Euclidean space, but the case when K is a halfsphere is different. This is what we investigate here, establishing the asymptotic behaviour, as n tends to infinity, of the expectation of several characteristics of Pn, such as facet and vertex number, volume and surface area. For the Hausdorff distance from the halfsphere, we obtain also some almost sure asymptotic estimates. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
