Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Diacylglycerol (DAG) is required for membrane traffic and structural organization at the Golgi. DAG is a lipid metabolite of several enzymatic reactions present at this organelle, but the mechanisms by which they are regulated are still unknown. Here, we show that cargo arrival at the Golgi increases the recruitment of the DAG-sensing constructs C1-PKC\u03b8-GFP and the PKD-wt-GFP. The recruitment of both constructs was reduced by PLC\u03b31 silencing. Post-Golgi trafficking of transmembrane and soluble proteins was impaired in PLC\u03b31-silenced cells. Under basal conditions, PLC\u03b31 contributed to the maintenance of the pool of DAG associated with the Golgi and to the structural organization of the organelle. Finally, we show that cytosolic phospholipase C (PLC) can hydrolyse phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in isolated Golgi membranes. Our results indicate that PLC\u03b31 is part of the molecular mechanism that couples cargo arrival at the Golgi with DAG production to co-ordinate the formation of transport carriers for post-Golgi traffic. Membrane traffic at the Golgi requires diacylglycerol. Cargo arrival triggers an increase in diacylglycerol at the Golgi in a manner dependent on phospholipase C\u03b31. Phospholipase C\u03b31 is also involved in post-Golgi protein transport and in the maintenance of Golgi morphology. Our results implicate phospholipase C\u03b31 in co-ordinating membrane traffic at the Golgi.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diacylglycerol", "Golgi", "Membrane trafficking", "Phospholipase C", "Protein kinase D"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Membrane", "Cytosol", "Diglycerides", "Golgi Apparatus", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates", "Phospholipase C gamma", "Protein Kinase C", "Protein Transport", "Type C Phospholipases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923229772", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"49862094600": {"Name": "Sicart A.", "AuthorID": "49862094600", "AffiliationID": "60025063, 60019793", "AffiliationName": "Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB), Centre for the Biology of Disease and KU Leuven, Department of Human Genetics"}, "7003420161": {"Name": "Egea G.", "AuthorID": "7003420161", "AffiliationID": "60010814", "AffiliationName": "Institut d'Investigacions Biom\u00e8diques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS)"}, "6701643539": {"Name": "Sarri E.", "AuthorID": "6701643539", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Departament de Biologia Cellular, Immunologia i Neuroci\u00e8ncies, Facultat de Medicina, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "7102317240": {"Name": "Katan M.", "AuthorID": "7102317240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
