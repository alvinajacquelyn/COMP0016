A methodical, step-by-step, symbolic analysis, exploiting a simplified EKV-based approximation is performed upon customary static TL topologies, including the four MOS transistor (MOST) multiplier/divider, the squarer circuit and the alternating formation of a six MOST multiplier/divider. The logarithmic integrator is treated as a typical dynamic TL analysis example. The produced EKV-based symbolic analysis results are compared against the ideally expected behaviours and Spectre\u00ae-BSIM3V3model-simulations. The satisfying agreement between the proposed EKV-based model and Spectre simulator allowed us to proceed further and investigate the conditions under which optimal behaviour is achieved. Optimisation techniques, based on MOSTs' geometrical parameters combinations, resulted in the articulation of practical design rules.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EKV model", "Log-domain circuits", "Optimisation", "Subthreshold MOSFETs", "Translinear circuits"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ekv models", "Log domain circuits", "MOSFETs", "Optimisations", "Translinear circuits"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969262666", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55357565700": {"Name": "Papadimitriou K.", "AuthorID": "55357565700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "56814931300": {"Name": "Houssein A.", "AuthorID": "56814931300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "35566095900": {"Name": "Drakakis E.", "AuthorID": "35566095900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}}}
