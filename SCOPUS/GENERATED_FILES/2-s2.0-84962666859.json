More recently, studies using continuous flash suppression (CFS) have reported that multisensory integration influences how long visual stimuli remain suppressed. In this study, using CFS, we examined whether the contrast thresholds for detecting visual looming stimuli are influenced by a congruent auditory stimulus. In Experiment 1, we show that a looming visual stimulus can result in lower detection thresholds compared to a static concentric grating, but that auditory tone pips congruent with the looming stimulus did not lower suppression thresholds any further. In Experiments 2, 3, and 4, we again observed no advantage for congruent multisensory stimuli. These results add to our understanding of the conditions under which multisensory integration is possible, and suggest that certain forms of multisensory integration are not evident when the visual stimulus is suppressed from awareness using CFS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Audiovisual integration", "Audiovisual looming", "Binocular rivalry", "Continuous flash suppression", "Interocular suppression", "Multisensory integration", "Visual awareness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962666859", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"54957637400": {"Name": "Moors P.", "AuthorID": "54957637400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, University of Leuven (KU Leuven)"}, "57188732781": {"Name": "Huygelier H.", "AuthorID": "57188732781", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, University of Leuven (KU Leuven)"}, "7006148651": {"Name": "Wagemans J.", "AuthorID": "7006148651", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, University of Leuven (KU Leuven)"}, "22984662400": {"Name": "De-Wit L.", "AuthorID": "22984662400", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, University of Leuven (KU Leuven)"}, "55031825700": {"Name": "Van Ee R.", "AuthorID": "55031825700", "AffiliationID": "60016561", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain, Body and Behavior, Philips Research Laboratories"}}}
