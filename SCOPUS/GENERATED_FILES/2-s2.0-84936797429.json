A variety of thresholds have been applied in the literature to define Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography positivity, but the ability of these thresholds to detect early amyloid-\u03b2 deposition is unknown, and validation studies comparing Pittsburgh compound-B thresholds to post-mortem amyloid burden are lacking. In this study we first derived thresholds for amyloid positron emission tomography positivity using Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography in 154 cognitively normal older adults with four complementary approaches: (i) reference values from a young control group aged between 20 and 30 years; (ii) a Gaussian mixture model that assigned each subject a probability of being amyloid-\u03b2-positive or amyloid-\u03b2-negative based on Pittsburgh compound-B index uptake; (iii) a k-means cluster approach that clustered subjects into amyloid-\u03b2-positive or amyloid-\u03b2-negative based on Pittsburgh compound-B uptake in different brain regions (features); and (iv) an iterative voxel-based analysis that further explored the spatial pattern of early amyloid-\u03b2 positron emission tomography signal. Next, we tested the sensitivity and specificity of the derived thresholds in 50 individuals who underwent Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography during life and brain autopsy (mean time positron emission tomography to autopsy 3.1 \u00b1 1.8 years). Amyloid at autopsy was classified using Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) criteria, unadjusted for age. The analytic approaches yielded low thresholds (standard uptake value ratio<inf>low</inf> = 1.21, distribution volume ratio<inf>low</inf> = 1.08) that represent the earliest detectable Pittsburgh compound-B signal, as well as high thresholds (standard uptake value ratio<inf>high</inf> = 1.40, distribution volume ratio<inf>high</inf> = 1.20) that are more conservative in defining Pittsburgh compound-B positron emission tomography positivity. In voxel-wise contrasts, elevated Pittsburgh compound-B retention was first noted in the medial frontal cortex, then the precuneus, lateral frontal and parietal lobes, and finally the lateral temporal lobe. When compared to post-mortem amyloid burden, low proposed thresholds were more sensitive than high thresholds (sensitivities: distribution volume ratio<inf>low</inf> 81.0%, standard uptake value ratio<inf>low</inf> 83.3%; distribution volume ratio<inf>high</inf> 61.9%, standard uptake value ratio<inf>high</inf> 62.5%) for CERAD moderate-to-frequent neuritic plaques, with similar specificity (distribution volume ratio<inf>low</inf> 95.8%; standard uptake value ratio<inf>low</inf>, distribution volume ratio<inf>high</inf> and standard uptake value ratio<inf>high</inf> 100.0%). A receiver operator characteristic analysis identified optimal distribution volume ratio (1.06) and standard uptake value ratio (1.20) thresholds that were nearly identical to the a priori distribution volume ratio<inf>low</inf> and standard uptake value ratio<inf>low</inf>. In summary, we found that frequently applied thresholds for Pittsburgh compound-B positivity (typically at or above distribution volume ratio<inf>high</inf> and standard uptake value ratio<inf>high</inf>) are overly stringent in defining amyloid positivity. Lower thresholds in this study resulted in higher sensitivity while not compromising specificity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "beta-amyloid", "biomarkers", "dementia", "neurodegeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Aniline Compounds", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Reference Values", "Thiazoles", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936797429", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26421891100": {"Name": "Villeneuve S.", "AuthorID": "26421891100", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley"}, "56084814900": {"Name": "Rabinovici G.", "AuthorID": "56084814900", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Centre, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "55583922200": {"Name": "Cohn-Sheehy B.", "AuthorID": "55583922200", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Centre, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "6601995257": {"Name": "Madison C.", "AuthorID": "6601995257", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley"}, "56060042900": {"Name": "Ayakta N.", "AuthorID": "56060042900", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Centre, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "55619468600": {"Name": "Ghosh P.", "AuthorID": "55619468600", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Centre, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "36163258500": {"Name": "La Joie R.", "AuthorID": "36163258500", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley"}, "56716303000": {"Name": "Arthur-Bentil S.", "AuthorID": "56716303000", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "56067603600": {"Name": "Vogel J.", "AuthorID": "56067603600", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley"}, "54792144300": {"Name": "Marks S.", "AuthorID": "54792144300", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley"}, "57195292229": {"Name": "Lehmann M.", "AuthorID": "57195292229", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Centre, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "7006830290": {"Name": "Jagust W.", "AuthorID": "7006830290", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "56788643900": {"Name": "Rosen H.", "AuthorID": "56788643900", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Centre, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "6701463422": {"Name": "Boxer A.", "AuthorID": "6701463422", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Centre, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "35377631700": {"Name": "Miller B.", "AuthorID": "35377631700", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Memory and Aging Centre, Department of Neurology, University of California"}, "14829091300": {"Name": "Grinberg L.", "AuthorID": "14829091300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of California"}, "56425848000": {"Name": "Seeley W.", "AuthorID": "56425848000", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of California"}, "35475679900": {"Name": "Reed B.", "AuthorID": "35475679900", "AffiliationID": "60105916", "AffiliationName": "Veterans Affairs Northern California Health Care System"}, "35453695200": {"Name": "Olichney J.", "AuthorID": "35453695200", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of California"}, "35353598300": {"Name": "Decarli C.", "AuthorID": "35353598300", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of California"}, "36972940300": {"Name": "Borys E.", "AuthorID": "36972940300", "AffiliationID": "60029627, 60003545", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Stritch School of Medicine, Loyola University"}, "7403328844": {"Name": "Jin L.", "AuthorID": "7403328844", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of California"}, "8048570300": {"Name": "Huang E.", "AuthorID": "8048570300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of California"}}}
