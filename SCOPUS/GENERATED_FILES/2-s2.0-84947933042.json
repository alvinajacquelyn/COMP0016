These new systems could make a remarkable improvement in public safety and have many applications in a variety of fields such as agriculture or postage of packages. In order to test UAV capacities and train UAV mission operators, several simulators are used, and the use of them usually entails high costs. This work presents a low-cost and easily distributable simulator, focused on simulating missions carried out by multiple UAVs and extracting data from them. To evaluate its effectiveness, it has been subjected to stress testing with thousands of virtual users, proving to have a potentially competitive response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer-based Simulator", "Human-Robot Interaction", "UAV", "Web"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design and Development", "High costs", "Multiple UAVs", "Public safety", "Stress Testing", "UAV missions", "Virtual users", "Web"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947933042", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56732878000": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Fernandez V.", "AuthorID": "56732878000", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "7003774102": {"Name": "Camacho D.", "AuthorID": "7003774102", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica Superior, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "42661760100": {"Name": "Menendez H.", "AuthorID": "42661760100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
