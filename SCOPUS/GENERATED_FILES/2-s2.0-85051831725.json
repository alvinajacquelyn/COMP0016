The Greek word hysteria means the uterus, and he thought the uterus could wander out of the pelvis with hysterical symptoms occurring wherever the womb might lodge. For example, it might attach itself to the liver and could be detached from there by hand.I7 Similarly, it might be lured back to its location by burning fragrant aromas at the vagina or driven back by unpleasant odors at the nostrils. His ideas are said to have derived from even earlier Egyptian sorces. Since then the history of changing concepts of hysteria is interwoven with demonology, witchcraft, femininity, sexuality, and emotional conflict. The history of hysteria has been well chronicled by Veith,\u2019 who reviewed the subject up to the 19th century. More recently, a deliberate parallel title to that historical account further elaborates the ideas which deal with the relationship between feelings, somatic changes, and the state of the brain4 in hysterical presentations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051831725", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7006828264": {"Name": "Manchanda R.", "AuthorID": "7006828264", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Western Ontario"}, "35551548000": {"Name": "Merskey H.", "AuthorID": "35551548000", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Western Ontario"}}}
