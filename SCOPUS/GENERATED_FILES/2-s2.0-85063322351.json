How nuclear scaling is regulated and contributes to cell function is poorly understood, especially in skeletal muscle fibers, which are among the largest cells, containing hundreds of nuclei. Here, we present a Drosophila in vivo system to analyze nuclear scaling in whole multinucleated muscle fibers, genetically manipulate individual components, and assess muscle function. Despite precise global coordination, we find that individual nuclei within a myofiber establish different local scaling relationships by adjusting their size and synthetic activity in correlation with positional or spatial cues. While myonuclei exhibit compensatory potential, even minor changes in global nuclear size scaling correlate with reduced muscle function. Our study provides the first comprehensive approach to unraveling the intrinsic regulation of size in multinucleated muscle fibers. These insights to muscle cell biology will accelerate the development of interventions for muscle diseases. Muscle fibers are large multinucleated cells with remarkable size plasticity. Windner et al. investigate the relationship between muscle cell size and nuclear content. They show that cells contain a heterogeneous population of nuclei and explore mechanisms of nuclear coordination, as well as the functional consequences of scaling perturbations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell size", "Drosophila", "Fibrillarin", "nuclear positioning", "nuclear scaling", "nuclear synthetic activity", "nucleolus", "polyploidy", "skeletal muscle", "syncytial organization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Nucleus", "Cell Size", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Giant Cells", "Larva", "Muscle Fibers, Skeletal", "Muscle, Skeletal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063322351", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"41762943900": {"Name": "Windner S.", "AuthorID": "41762943900", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57208029998": {"Name": "Brown A.", "AuthorID": "57208029998", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "6603772464": {"Name": "Baylies M.", "AuthorID": "6603772464", "AffiliationID": "60009343", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center"}, "57188856699": {"Name": "Manhart A.", "AuthorID": "57188856699", "AffiliationID": "60003261, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Courant Institute, New York University"}, "7004186241": {"Name": "Mogilner A.", "AuthorID": "7004186241", "AffiliationID": "60003261, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Courant Institute, New York University"}}}
