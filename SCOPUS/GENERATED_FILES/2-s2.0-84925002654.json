Objective: To test the hypothesis that offspring of gestational diabetic mothers (OGDM) have high cortisol and cardiosympathetic responses during the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C). Design: Adolescents from a birth cohort in India (n = 213; mean age, 13.5 y), including 26 OGDM, 22 offspring of diabetic fathers (ODF), and 165 offspring of nondiabetic parents (controls) completed 5 minutes each of public speaking and mental arithmetic tasks in front of two unfamiliar \"evaluators\" (TSST-C). Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured at baseline and at regular intervals after the TSST-C. Heart rate, blood pressure (BP), stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were measured continuously at baseline, during the TSST-C, and for 10 minutes after the test using a finger cuff; the beat-to-beat values were averaged for these periods. Results: Cortisol and cardiosympathetic parameters increased from baseline during stress (P < .001). OGDM had greater systolic BP (mean difference, 5.6 mm Hg), cardiac output (0.5 L/min), and stroke volume (4.0 mL) increases and a lower total peripheral resistance rise (125 dyn\u00b7s/cm5) than controls during stress. ODF had greater systolic BP responses than controls (difference, 4.1 mm Hg); there was no difference in other cardiosympathetic parameters. Cortisol responses were similar in all three groups. Conclusions: Maternal diabetes during pregnancy is associated with higher cardiosympathetic stress responses in the offspring, which may contribute to their higher cardiovascular disease risk. Further research may confirm stress-response programming as a predictor of cardiovascular risk in OGDM.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cardiovascular System", "Case-Control Studies", "Diabetes, Gestational", "Female", "Humans", "India", "Male", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Risk Factors", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925002654", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"12771221000": {"Name": "Krishnaveni G.V.", "AuthorID": "12771221000", "AffiliationID": "60139057, 60021990", "AffiliationName": "St. John's Research Institute, St. John's National Academy of Health Sciences"}, "12771703800": {"Name": "Veena S.R.", "AuthorID": "12771703800", "AffiliationID": "108868565", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology Research Unit, CSI Holdsworth Memorial Hospital"}, "12770794800": {"Name": "Karat S.C.", "AuthorID": "12770794800", "AffiliationID": "108868565", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology Research Unit, CSI Holdsworth Memorial Hospital"}, "12795736600": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "12795736600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, University College London Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7202489635": {"Name": "Srinivasan K.", "AuthorID": "7202489635", "AffiliationID": "60139057, 60021990", "AffiliationName": "St. John's Research Institute, St. John's National Academy of Health Sciences"}, "7004363127": {"Name": "Kurpad A.V.", "AuthorID": "7004363127", "AffiliationID": "60139057, 60021990", "AffiliationName": "St. John's Research Institute, St. John's National Academy of Health Sciences"}, "7103383561": {"Name": "Osmond C.", "AuthorID": "7103383561", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60015879, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}, "57202566908": {"Name": "Fall C.H.D.", "AuthorID": "57202566908", "AffiliationID": "60023615, 60015879, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Lifecourse Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton"}}}
