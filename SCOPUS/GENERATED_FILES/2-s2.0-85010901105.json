However, activity- and state-dependent changes in pump activity can also influence neuronal firing and regulate rhythmic network output. Here we demonstrate that changes in sodium pump activity regulate locomotor networks in the spinal cord of neonatal mice. The sodium pump inhibitor, ouabain, increased the frequency and decreased the amplitude of drug-induced locomotor bursting, effects that were dependent on the presence of the neuromodulator dopamine. Conversely, activating the pump with the sodium ionophore monensin decreased burst frequency. When more \u201cnatural\u201d locomotor output was evoked using dorsal-root stimulation, ouabain increased burst frequency and extended locomotor episode duration, whereas monensin slowed and shortened episodes. Decreasing the time between dorsal-root stimulation, and therefore interepisode interval, also shortened and slowed activity, suggesting that pump activity encodes information about past network output and contributes to feedforward control of subsequent locomotor bouts. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from spinal motoneurons and interneurons, we describe a long-duration (~60 s), activity-dependent, TTX- and ouabain-sensitive, hyperpolarization (~5 mV), which is mediated by spike-dependent increases in pump activity. The duration of this dynamic pump potential is enhanced by dopamine. Our results therefore reveal sodium pumps as dynamic regulators of mammalian spinal motor networks that can also be affected by neuromodulatory systems. Given the involvement of sodium pumps in movement disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and rapid-onset dystonia parkinsonism, knowledge of their contribution to motor network regulation also has considerable clinical importance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central pattern generator", "Locomotion", "Mouse", "Na+/K+-ATPase", "Sodium pump", "Spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Female", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Motor Neurons", "Nerve Net", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Ouabain", "Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase", "Spinal Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010901105", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"54921978800": {"Name": "Picton L.D.", "AuthorID": "54921978800", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}, "56311155900": {"Name": "Nascimento F.", "AuthorID": "56311155900", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}, "57193115279": {"Name": "Broadhead M.J.", "AuthorID": "57193115279", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}, "7004406563": {"Name": "Sillar K.T.", "AuthorID": "7004406563", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}, "7005952003": {"Name": "Miles G.B.", "AuthorID": "7005952003", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews"}}}
