Union Physiol. Sci./Am. Physiol. Soc.There has been increasing interest in the role that gut hormones may play in contributing to the physiological changes produced by certain bariatric procedures, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Here, we review the evidence implicating one such gut hormone, glucagon-like peptide-1, as a mediator of the metabolic benefits of these two procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bariatric Surgery", "Gastrectomy", "Gastric Bypass", "Glucagon-Like Peptide 1", "Humans", "Obesity", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920949773", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"55815739900": {"Name": "Manning S.", "AuthorID": "55815739900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}, "37102604700": {"Name": "Pucci A.", "AuthorID": "37102604700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH Centre for Weight Loss, Metabolic and Endocrine Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "7004418512": {"Name": "Batterham R.L.", "AuthorID": "7004418512", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
