In the two-dimensional Coulomb gas, it corresponds to an insulator-conductor transition driven by charge deconfinement. We investigate the global topological properties of this transition, both analytically and by numerical simulation, using a lattice-field description of the two-dimensional Coulomb gas on a torus. The BKT transition is shown to be an ergodicity breaking between the topological sectors of the electric field, which implies a definition of topological order in terms of broken ergodicity. The breakdown of local topological order at the BKT transition leads to the excitation of global topological defects in the electric field, corresponding to different topological sectors. The quantized nature of these classical excitations, and their strict suppression by ergodicity breaking in the low-temperature phase, afford striking global signatures of topological-sector fluctuations at the BKT transition. We discuss how these signatures could be detected in experiments on, for example, magnetic films and cold-atom systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929095723", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56637902200": {"Name": "Faulkner M.F.", "AuthorID": "56637902200", "AffiliationID": "60005667, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"}, "7006543434": {"Name": "Bramwell S.T.", "AuthorID": "7006543434", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7005190896": {"Name": "Holdsworth P.C.W.", "AuthorID": "7005190896", "AffiliationID": "60005667, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique, Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"}}}
