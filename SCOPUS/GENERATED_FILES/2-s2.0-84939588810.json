TPMT genotype was measured in 2387 patients (76% of trial entrants): 2190 were homozygous wild-type, 189 were heterozygous for low activity TPMT alleles (166 TPMT*1/*3A, 19 TPMT*1/*3C, 3 TPMT*1/*2 and 1 TPMT*1/*9) and 8 were TPMT deficient. In contrast to the preceding trial ALL97, there was no difference in event-free survival (EFS) between the TPMT genotypes. The 5-year EFS for heterozygous TPMT*1/*3A patients was the same in both trials (88%), but for the homozygous wild-type TPMT*1/*1 patients, EFS improved from 80% in ALL97% to 88% in ALL2003. Importantly, the unexplained worse outcome for heterozygous TPMT*1/*3C patients observed in ALL97 (5-year EFS 53%) was not seen in ALL2003 (5-year EFS 94%). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis the only significant factor affecting EFS was MRD status (hazard ratio for high-risk MRD patients 4\u00b722, 95% confidence interval 2\u00b797-5\u00b799, P < 0\u00b70001). In conclusion, refinements in risk stratification and treatment have reduced the influence of TPMT genotype on treatment outcome in a contemporary protocol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia", "Mercaptopurine", "Minimal residual disease", "Thiopurine methyltransferase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Great Britain", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Methyltransferases", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Neoplasm, Residual", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939588810", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"7004742950": {"Name": "Lennard L.", "AuthorID": "7004742950", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Metabolism, University of Sheffield"}, "14821787800": {"Name": "Cartwright C.S.", "AuthorID": "14821787800", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Metabolism, University of Sheffield"}, "23490344200": {"Name": "Wade R.", "AuthorID": "23490344200", "AffiliationID": "60022323", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Service Unit"}, "35430808700": {"Name": "Vora A.", "AuthorID": "35430808700", "AffiliationID": "60002869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Haematology, Children's Hospital"}}}
