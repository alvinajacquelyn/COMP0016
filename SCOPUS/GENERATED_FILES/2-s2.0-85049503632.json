The main goal of the research to be done is to provide industrials, producers and consumers with a methodology based in low-cost, portable and miniature NIRS sensors and information and communication technologies for process control and voluntary labelling, to guarantee the integrity of the EU high added-value as the \"acorn Iberian pig ham\". The present study is focussed in transferring a database (470 samples) of IP tissue - analysed in a FOSS-NIRSystems 6500 (FNS6500) spectrometer, during the seasons 2009-2011 - to a portable/miniature instrument MicroNIR-Onsite, VIAVI (MN1700). A set of 30 samples of adipose tissue was taken from a slaughterhouse during 2015-2016, being analysed in parallel in the satellite (FNS 6500) and master (MN 1700) instruments. Latter on, they were divided in two sets: N = 10 for building the standardization matrices and N = 20 for the validation of the cloning procedure. The algorithm Piece-Wise Direct Standardization (PDS) was applied. The best standardisation matrix was applied to the library of 470 samples taken in the FNS 6500, enabling an excellent fitting between both instruments, as shown the RMSCs statistic calculated in the satellite before and after the standardization and in the master - 108457 vs 22519 vs 17646 \u03bclog 1/R - and the GH distance before and after standardisation between both instruments 437.41 vs 2.06.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acorn Iberian pig ham", "instruments standardization", "on-site NIR analysis", "spectral matching"], "IndexKeywords": ["Added values", "Adipose tissue", "Iberian pigs", "Information and Communication Technologies", "Low costs", "on-site NIR analysis", "Piece-wise", "Spectral matchings"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049503632", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"13807579400": {"Name": "Garrido-Varo A.", "AuthorID": "13807579400", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Non- Destructive Spectral Sensors UNIT, Faculty of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "25930572900": {"Name": "Riccioli C.", "AuthorID": "25930572900", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Non- Destructive Spectral Sensors UNIT, Faculty of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "6603021014": {"Name": "De Pedro E.", "AuthorID": "6603021014", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Non- Destructive Spectral Sensors UNIT, Faculty of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "13807078600": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Mar\u00edn D.", "AuthorID": "13807078600", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Non- Destructive Spectral Sensors UNIT, Faculty of Agricultural and Forestry Engineering, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "7004179964": {"Name": "Fearn T.", "AuthorID": "7004179964", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
