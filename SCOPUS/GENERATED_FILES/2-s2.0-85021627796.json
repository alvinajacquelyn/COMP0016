The photoluminescence spectra of Ag-Ag2S/rGO showed two obvious emission peaks at 327 and 339 nm with the excitation wavelength at 287 nm. Compared with Ag-Ag2S heterostructured clusters with two peaks at 407 and 430 nm, it showed a big blue shift and higher intensity, which makes it a novel candidate for long-wave UV radiation emitting nanocomposite.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ag2S-Ag", "Graphene", "Hybrids", "Radiation emit"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blue shift", "Decomposition approach", "Emission peaks", "Excitation wavelength", "Hybrids", "Long waves", "Photoluminescence spectrum", "Reduced graphene oxides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021627796", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"51763877800": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "51763877800", "AffiliationID": "60032504", "AffiliationName": "School of Material Engineering, Shanghai University of Engineering Science"}, "57191248248": {"Name": "Xu R.", "AuthorID": "57191248248", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56645908100": {"Name": "Ling M.", "AuthorID": "56645908100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
