MicroRNAs (miRNA), short non-coding RNAs, are key regulators of gene expression through the post-transcriptional and post-translational modification of mRNA. The association of miRNA expression with infertility or polycystic ovarian syndrome has been widely investigated; however, there are limited data regarding the importance of miRNA regulation in DNA repair during preimplantation embryo development. In this article, we review normal miRNA biogenesis and consequences of aberrant miRNA expression in the regulation of DNA repair in gametes and preimplantation embryos.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA repair", "Embryo development", "miRNA", "miRNA biogenesis", "mRNA expression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blastocyst", "DNA Repair", "Embryo Culture Techniques", "Embryonic Development", "Female", "Fertilization", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Oocytes", "Phenotype", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy, Animal", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975063199", "SubjectAreas": [["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"]], "AuthorData": {"55450610200": {"Name": "Tulay P.", "AuthorID": "55450610200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Preimplantation Genetics Group, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "16067597500": {"Name": "Sengupta S.", "AuthorID": "16067597500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Preimplantation Genetics Group, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}}}
