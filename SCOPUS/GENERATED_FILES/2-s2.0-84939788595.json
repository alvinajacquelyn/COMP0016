The standard Galerkin finite element method can only give a low-order convergence even if the source term is very smooth due to the presence of the singularity term x<sup>\u03b1 - 1</sup> in the solution representation. In order to enhance the convergence, we develop a simple singularity reconstruction strategy by splitting the solution into a singular part and a regular part, where the former captures explicitly the singularity. We derive a new variational formulation for the regular part, and show that the Galerkin approximation of the regular part can achieve a better convergence order in the L<sup>2</sup>(0,1), H<sup>\u03b1/2</sup>(0,1) and L<sup>\u221e</sup> (0,1)-norms than the standard Galerkin approach, with a convergence rate for the recovered singularity strength identical with the L<sup>2</sup>(0,1) error estimate. The reconstruction approach is very flexible in handling explicit singularity, and it is further extended to the case of a Neumann type boundary condition on the left end point, which involves a strong singularity x<sup>\u03b1 - 2</sup>. Extensive numerical results confirm the theoretical study and efficiency of the proposed approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Error estimate", "Finite element method", "Fractional boundary value problem", "Riemann-Liouville derivative", "Singularity reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Error estimates", "Galerkin approximations", "Galerkin finite element methods", "Riemann-Liouville derivatives", "Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives", "Solution representation", "Two point boundary value problems", "Variational formulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939788595", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55649851300": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "55649851300", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A and M University"}}}
