It is monoclinic, space group P21/c, Z = 4, with unit-cell parameters a = 7.222(2), b = 10.484(3), c = 17.327(4)\u00c5, \u03b2 = 109.57(2)\u00b0, and V = 1236.1(6)\u00c53 [\u03c1calc = 1770(1)kgm-3] at 5K. The structure consists of isolated [Mg(H2O)6]2+ octahedra, [SeO4]2- tetrahedra and three interstitial lattice water molecules, all on sites of symmetry 1. The positions of the H atoms agree well with those inferred on the basis of geometrical considerations in the prior X-ray powder diffraction structure determination: no evidence of orientational disorder of the water molecules is apparent in the temperature range studied. Six of the nine water molecules are hydrogen bonded to one another to form a unique centrosymmetric dodecamer, (H2O)12. Raman spectra have been acquired in the range 170-4000cm-1 at 259 and 78K; ab initio calculations, using density functional theory, have been carried out in order to aid in the analysis of the Raman spectrum as well as providing additional insights into the geometry and thermodynamics of the hydrogen bonds. Complementary information concerning the thermal expansion, crystal morphology and the solubility are also presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dodecamer", "magnesium selenate enneahydrate", "neutron diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Dodecamer", "Geometrical considerations", "Information concerning", "Neutron single crystals", "Neutron time of flight", "Orientational disorder", "Unit cell parameters", "Crystal morphologies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930466232", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7004475745": {"Name": "Fortes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7004475745", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7004035504": {"Name": "Alf\u00e8 D.", "AuthorID": "7004035504", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "7006040465": {"Name": "Gutmann M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006040465", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "24347743600": {"Name": "Hern\u00e1ndez E.R.", "AuthorID": "24347743600", "AffiliationID": "60006424, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Ciencia de Materiales de Madrid (ICMM-CSIC), Campus de Cantoblanco"}}}
