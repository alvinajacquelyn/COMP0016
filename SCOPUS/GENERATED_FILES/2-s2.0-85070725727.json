Most metal structures made of steel or aluminum alloy exhibit ductile behavior until reaching the ULS. However, brittle fracture rarely occurs in structures exposed to cold temperatures or in aged structures even at room temperature. For safety studies of structures and infrastructures under extreme loads, accurately and efficiently predicting the maximum load-carrying capacity or the ultimate strength is essential. Various methods of predicting the ultimate strength, which account for the effects of both geometric and material nonlinearities, are available (as described in Chap. 3). This chapter presents computational models for analyzing the nonlinear responses of structures under extreme loads until and after the ULS is reached.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070725727", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
