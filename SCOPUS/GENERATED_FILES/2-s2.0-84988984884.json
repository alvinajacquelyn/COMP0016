This new learning, however, usually remains rigid and context-dependent. Conceptual enrichment (COEN) training is a therapy approach aimed to produce more flexible and generalisable learning in SD. In this study we compare generalisation and maintenance of learning after COEN with performance achieved using a classical naming therapy (NT). The study recruited a 62-year-old woman with SD. An AB1ACAB2 experimental design was implemented, with naming performance assessed at baseline, post- intervention, 3 and 6 weeks after the end of each treatment phase. Three generalisation tasks were also assessed pre- and post-intervention. Naming post-intervention improved significantly following both therapies, however, words trained using COEN therapy showed a significantly greater degree of generalisation than those trained under NT. In addition, only words trained with COEN continued to show significant improvements compared with baseline performance when assessed 6 weeks after practice ceased. It was concluded that therapies based on conceptual enrichment of the semantic network facilitate relearning of words and enhance generalisation in patients with SD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive therapy", "conceptual enrichment", "generalisation of learning", "Semantic dementia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chi-Square Distribution", "Cognitive Therapy", "Concept Formation", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Generalization (Psychology)", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Names", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Time Factors", "Verbal Learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988984884", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"26431133100": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Gonz\u00e1lez A.", "AuthorID": "26431133100", "AffiliationID": "60033267", "AffiliationName": "Memory Disorders Unit, Department of Neurology, University Hospital Virgen del Roc\u00edo"}, "36129154800": {"Name": "Savage S.A.", "AuthorID": "36129154800", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Research, University of Exeter Medical School"}, "7004993094": {"Name": "Caine D.", "AuthorID": "7004993094", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
