In addition to providing an updated summary of the existing literature, thismeta-analysis explored whether reductions in riskmay be the product of misclassification bias. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic search was undertaken, identifying studies that reported a temporal association between alcohol consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes. No restrictions were placed upon the language or date of publication. Non-English publications were, where necessary, translated using online translation tools. Models were constructed using fractional polynomial regression to determine the best-fitting dose-response relationship between alcohol intake and type 2 diabetes, with a priori testing of sex and referent group interactions. RESULTS Thirty-eight studiesmet the selection criteria, representing 1,902,605 participants and 125,926 cases of type 2 diabetes. A conventional noncurrent drinking category was reported by 33 studies, while five reported a never-drinking category. Relative to combined abstainers, reductions in the risk of type 2 diabetes were present at all levels of alcohol intake <63 g/day, with risks increasing above this threshold. Peak risk reduction was present between 10-14 g/day at an 18% decrease in hazards. Stratification of available data revealed that reductions in risk may be specific to women only and absent in studies that adopted a never-drinking abstention category or sampled an Asian population region. CONCLUSIONS Reductions in risk among moderate alcohol drinkers may be confined to women and non-Asian populations. Although based on a minority of studies, there is also the possibility that reductions in risk may have been overestimated by studies using a referent group contaminated by less healthy former drinkers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alcohol Drinking", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Ethanol", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962425653", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"55831088900": {"Name": "Knott C.", "AuthorID": "55831088900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55621388300": {"Name": "Bell S.", "AuthorID": "55621388300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "20133865900": {"Name": "Britton A.", "AuthorID": "20133865900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
