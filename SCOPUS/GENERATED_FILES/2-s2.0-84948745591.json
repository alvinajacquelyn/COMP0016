All rights reserved.Single-crystal materials are widely used in optics and electronics field and are essential in condensed matter physics and materials science researches. However, the hard and brittle nature of the materials prevents it from manufacturing intricate features and optical quality surfaces. Nanometric cutting assisted with ion implantation surface modification method reduces the fracture and tool wear during machining by improving the surface mechanical properties. The mechanism, techniques, and applications of this method are specifically explained in the chapter.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystal surfaces", "Electronics fields", "Nano-metric cuttings", "Optical quality surfaces", "Science research", "Single-crystal materials", "Surface mechanical properties", "Surface modification methods"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948745591", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55648501300": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "55648501300", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Centre of MicroNano Manufacturing Technology, Tianjin University"}, "7202929910": {"Name": "Fang F.", "AuthorID": "7202929910", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Precision Measuring Technology and Instruments, Centre of MicroNano Manufacturing Technology, Tianjin University"}}}
