Demographic information, diagnosis, and any adverse events were recorded. Change in IOP post-pre switch was analyzed using a 2-sided Student's paired t-test at the 5% significance level. \u25cf RESULTS: There was a statistically significant mean reduction in IOP at the first follow up visit, which was maintained at subsequent follow up visits for patients regardless of diagnosis, or pre-switch treatment (P<0.001). Subgroup analysis also demonstrated a statistically significant mean reduction in IOP when looking at OHT patients only, as well as patients with any diagnosis switched from latanoprost monotherapy to bimatoprost monotherapy (P<0.001). \u25cf CONCLUSION: This is the largest independent data set which supports switching glaucoma patients with poor response to current treatment onto bimatoprost monotherapy before considering other adjuvant medical or more invasive therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bimatoprost", "Glaucoma", "Latanoprost", "Ocular hypertension"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027528324", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56478557400": {"Name": "Brennan N.", "AuthorID": "56478557400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56636891100": {"Name": "Dehabadi M.H.", "AuthorID": "56636891100", "AffiliationID": "60105470", "AffiliationName": "London North West Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57195364546": {"Name": "Nair S.", "AuthorID": "57195364546", "AffiliationID": "60018901", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55574842900": {"Name": "Reekie I.", "AuthorID": "55574842900", "AffiliationID": "60018901", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55597103400": {"Name": "Obikpo R.", "AuthorID": "55597103400", "AffiliationID": "60018901", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "56811489900": {"Name": "Quartilho A.", "AuthorID": "56811489900", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
