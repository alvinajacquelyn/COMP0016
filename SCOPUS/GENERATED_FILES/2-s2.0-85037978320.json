Methods: We conducted a descriptive follow-up comparison study (n=989) in South Africa and Malawi. We tracked child development in 135 HIV-positive children compared to 854 uninfected children aged 4\u201313 years attending community-based organizations at baseline and again 12\u201315 months later. Results: Children with HIV were more often stunted (58.8% vs. 27.4%) and underweight (18.7% vs. 7.1%). They also had significantly poorer general physical functioning (M=93.37 vs. M=97.00). HIV-positive children scored significantly lower on digit span and the draw-a-person task. Conclusions: These data clearly show that HIV infection poses a serious risk for child development and that there is a need for scaled up interventions. Community-based services may be ideally placed to accommodate such provision and deliver urgently needed support to these children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive development", "HIV/AIDS", "Malawi", "physical functioning", "quality of life", "South Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Child", "Child Development", "Child Health Services", "Child, Preschool", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Developmental Disabilities", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Growth Disorders", "Health Services Needs and Demand", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Malawi", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Socioeconomic Factors", "South Africa", "Thinness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037978320", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"35847280700": {"Name": "Sherr L.", "AuthorID": "35847280700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, University College London"}, "54788172900": {"Name": "Macedo A.", "AuthorID": "54788172900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health, University College London"}, "57079062500": {"Name": "Hensels I.S.", "AuthorID": "57079062500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Manchester"}, "57203053013": {"Name": "Tomlinson M.", "AuthorID": "57203053013", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stellenbosch University"}, "36802889900": {"Name": "Skeen S.", "AuthorID": "36802889900", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Mental Health, University of Cape Town"}}}
