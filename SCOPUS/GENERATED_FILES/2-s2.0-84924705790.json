Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its more severe form non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Our aim was to investigate ex vivo the effect of AR on human primary HSC (hHSC) and verify in vivo the relevance of AR in NAFLD fibrogenesis. hHSC isolated from healthy liver segments were analyzed for expression of AR and its activator, TNF- converting enzyme (TACE). AR induction of hHSC proliferation and matrix production was estimated in the presence of antagonists. AR involvement in fibrogenesis was also assessed in a mouse model of NASH and in humans with NASH. hHSC time dependently expressed AR and TACE. AR increased hHSC proliferation through several mitogenic signaling pathways such as EGFR, PI3K and p38. AR also induced marked upregulation of hHSC fibrogenic markers and reduced hHSC death. AR expression was enhanced in the HSC of a murine model of NASH and of severe human NASH. In conclusion, AR induces hHSC fibrogenic activity via multiple mitogenic signaling pathways, and is upregulated in murine and human NASH, suggesting that AR antagonists may be clinically useful anti-fibrotics in NAFLD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actins", "ADAM Proteins", "Amphiregulin", "Animals", "Biopsy", "Cell Proliferation", "Collagen", "Disease Models, Animal", "Enzyme Activation", "Fibrosis", "Gene Expression", "Hepatic Stellate Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Protein Kinase C", "Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor", "Severity of Illness Index", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924705790", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35789212000": {"Name": "McKee C.", "AuthorID": "35789212000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6505991562": {"Name": "Sigala B.", "AuthorID": "6505991562", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6701667926": {"Name": "Soeda J.", "AuthorID": "6701667926", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35746945900": {"Name": "Mouralidarane A.", "AuthorID": "35746945900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "35789145600": {"Name": "Morgan M.", "AuthorID": "35789145600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7004037002": {"Name": "Selden C.", "AuthorID": "7004037002", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza'"}, "6602606185": {"Name": "Oben J.A.", "AuthorID": "6602606185", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603848797": {"Name": "Mazzoccoli G.", "AuthorID": "6603848797", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza"}, "56007949600": {"Name": "Rappa F.", "AuthorID": "56007949600", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Biomedicina Sperimentale e Neuroscienze Cliniche, Universita Degli Studi di Palermo"}, "7005573063": {"Name": "Cappello F.", "AuthorID": "7005573063", "AffiliationID": "112653449", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Euro-Mediterraneo di Scienza e Tecnologia (IEMEST)"}, "6602429673": {"Name": "Cabibi D.", "AuthorID": "6602429673", "AffiliationID": "60017697", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Patologia, University of Palermo"}, "12795672600": {"Name": "Pazienza V.", "AuthorID": "12795672600", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza'"}, "7005082907": {"Name": "Roskams T.", "AuthorID": "7005082907", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Laboratory OfMorphology and Molecular Pathology, University Hospitals of Leuven"}}}
