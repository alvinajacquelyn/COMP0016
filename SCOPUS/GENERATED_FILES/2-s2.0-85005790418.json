In this paper we extend the theory of so-called neighbourhood effects. Slums offer high returns on investment because beneficial effects are shared across many people in densely populated neighbourhoods. Neighbourhood effects also help explain how and why the benefits of interventions vary between slum and non-slum spaces and between slums. We build on this spatial concept of slums to argue that, in all low-income and-middle-income countries, census tracts should henceforth be designated slum or non-slum both to inform local policy and as the basis for research surveys that build on censuses. We argue that slum health should be promoted as a topic of enquiry alongside poverty and health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Health Policy", "Humans", "Poverty Areas", "Residence Characteristics", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005790418", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"22835354400": {"Name": "Lilford R.J.", "AuthorID": "22835354400", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "35798567300": {"Name": "Oyebode O.", "AuthorID": "35798567300", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "57188672699": {"Name": "Melendez-Torres G.J.", "AuthorID": "57188672699", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "57218382677": {"Name": "Chen Y.F.", "AuthorID": "57218382677", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "57189342156": {"Name": "Watson S.I.", "AuthorID": "57189342156", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "57192365324": {"Name": "Sartori J.", "AuthorID": "57192365324", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Centre for Applied Health Research and Delivery, University of Warwick"}, "6701599059": {"Name": "Satterthwaite D.", "AuthorID": "6701599059", "AffiliationID": "60092016", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Environment and Development"}, "14031638400": {"Name": "Mberu B.", "AuthorID": "14031638400", "AffiliationID": "106632915", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Centre"}, "55835130800": {"Name": "Haregu T.", "AuthorID": "55835130800", "AffiliationID": "106632915", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Centre"}, "6603938217": {"Name": "Ezeh A.", "AuthorID": "6603938217", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Witwatersrand"}, "16837118200": {"Name": "Ndugwa R.", "AuthorID": "16837118200", "AffiliationID": "117841939", "AffiliationName": "Global Urban Observatory, Research and Capacity Development Branch, United Nations Human Settlements Programme"}, "55667154700": {"Name": "Caiaffa W.", "AuthorID": "55667154700", "AffiliationID": "60030074", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais"}, "7006403263": {"Name": "Capon A.", "AuthorID": "7006403263", "AffiliationID": "100924140", "AffiliationName": "United Nations University"}, "6508384832": {"Name": "Saith R.", "AuthorID": "6508384832", "AffiliationID": "113455821", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Policy Management"}}}
