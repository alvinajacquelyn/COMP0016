A 2.5 m hydroelastic segmented catamaran model was tested in regular head sea waves at a high model speed in multiple test series, whilst five centre bow (CB) and wet-deck configurations were considered, designated here as the parent, low, high, long and short CBs. The model global motions, centre bow slam loads, accelerations, and slam induced vertical bending moments of the catamaran model in waves were measured. It was found that the slamming force, the centre bow entry force and slam induced bending moment all increase as the centre bow length increases. Increasing the wet-deck height increased the motions but reduced the maximum slam load in moderate waves. It was seen that the short CB was the best design for the alleviation of slam loads. The high CB was the second best choice for operation in moderate waves but it was the worst configuration in terms of heave and pitch motions among various CB configurations tested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Catamaran", "Center bow", "Hydroelastic segmented model", "Relative motion", "Vertical bending moment", "Wet-deck slamming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catamaran", "Center bow", "Hydroelastic", "Relative motion", "Vertical bending moments"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054072286", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"57200651220": {"Name": "Shabani B.", "AuthorID": "57200651220", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Tasmania"}, "35192156100": {"Name": "Lavroff J.", "AuthorID": "35192156100", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Tasmania"}, "7101792459": {"Name": "Holloway D.S.", "AuthorID": "7101792459", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Tasmania"}, "35600466300": {"Name": "Davis M.R.", "AuthorID": "35600466300", "AffiliationID": "60015356", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Tasmania"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.A.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
