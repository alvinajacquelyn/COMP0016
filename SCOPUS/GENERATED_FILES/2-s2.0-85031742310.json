The fate of eukaryotic transcripts is closely linked to their untranslated regions, which are determined by the position at which transcription starts and ends at a genomic locus. Although the extent of alternative transcription starts and alternative poly-adenylation sites has been revealed by sequencing methods focused on the ends of transcripts, the application of these methods is not yet widely adopted by the community. We suggest that computational methods applied to standard high-throughput technologies are a useful, albeit less accurate, alternative to the expertise-demanding 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequencing and they are the only option for analysing legacy transcriptomic data. We review these methods here, focusing on technical challenges and arguing for the need to include better normalization of the data and more appropriate statistical models of the expected variation in the signal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alternative poly-adenylation", "alternative transcription start site", "RNA-seq", "untranslated region"], "IndexKeywords": ["Eukaryota", "Exons", "Gene Expression Profiling", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Introns", "Models, Statistical", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Polyadenylation", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Software", "Transcription Initiation Site", "Transcriptome", "Untranslated Regions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031742310", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56823582200": {"Name": "Szkop K.J.", "AuthorID": "56823582200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6603320944": {"Name": "Nobeli I.", "AuthorID": "6603320944", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
