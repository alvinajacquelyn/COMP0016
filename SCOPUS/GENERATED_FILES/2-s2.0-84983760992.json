These results contrast sharply with previous use of conventional differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) techniques in areas with steep slopes, dense vegetation and large variability in water vapour which indicated around 12% phase coherent coverage. By contrast, sPOT is capable of measuring two dimensional deformation of large gradient over steeply sloped areas covered in dense vegetation. Previous applications of sPOT in this region relies on corner reflectors (CRs), (high coherence features) to obtain reliable measurements. However, CRs are expensive and difficult to install, especially in remote areas; and other potential high coherence features comparable with CRs are very few and outside the landslide boundary. The resultant sub-pixel level deformation field can be statistically analysed to yield multi-modal maps of deformation regions. This approach is shown to have a significant impact when compared with previous offset tracking measurements of landslide deformation, as it is demonstrated that sPOT can be applied even in densely vegetated terrain without relying on high-contrast surface features or requiring any de-noising process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corner Reflectors vs. natural scatterers", "Densely vegetated terrain", "Landslide monitoring", "Sub-Pixel Offset Tracking (sPOT)", "TerraSAR-X High-resolution Spotlight data"], "IndexKeywords": ["Densely vegetated terrain", "High-resolution spotlights", "Landslide monitoring", "Natural scatterers", "Offset tracking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983760992", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55461954100": {"Name": "Sun L.", "AuthorID": "55461954100", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "7404871794": {"Name": "Muller J.P.", "AuthorID": "7404871794", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}}}
