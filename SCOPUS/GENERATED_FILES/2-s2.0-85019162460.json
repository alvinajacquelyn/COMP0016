ZnO NPs were synthesized by the sol-gel auto-combustion method and then characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tunneling electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD confirmed the formation of single phase ZnO. The average particle size ranged from 40 to 55 nm as detected by SEM and TEM. Ten week old male albino mice were divided into four experimental groups; A, B and C were orally treated with 50 (low dose), 300 (medium dose) and 600 mg/ml solvent/kg body weight (high dose) of ZnO NPs for four days. The complete blood count, serum biochemical parameters and histological changes in vital organs of mice were determined in all four experimental treatments. Results indicated significantly higher Bilirubin levels in mice exposed to medium (p = 0.01) and high doses (p = 0.002) of ZnO NPs as compared to control group. ALT concentrations were significantly lower (p = 0.05) while creatinine was significantly higher (p =0.04) in mice exposed to low and high dose of NPs respectively. Histological analysis of liver and kidney in four treatments revealed a dose dependent effect of NPs on anatomy of studied vital organs. It was observed that oral treatment of 50 mg/ml solvent/kg body weight of ZnO NPs did not caused in any obvious health hazard in subjects. In contrast, the higher doses had reasoned toxicity in the subject animals. Based on our results, it is recommended that ZnO NPs should be used at less than 50 mg/ml solvent/kg body weight concentrations in commercial products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Albino mice", "Hematology", "Histology", "Nanoparticles", "Serum biochemistry", "Zinc oxide"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019162460", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55785745700": {"Name": "Zahra J.", "AuthorID": "55785745700", "AffiliationID": "60034410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Bahauddin Zakariya University"}, "15049157400": {"Name": "Ashiq M.N.", "AuthorID": "15049157400", "AffiliationID": "60034410", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical Sciences, Bahauddin Zakariya University"}, "35740645200": {"Name": "Iqbal S.", "AuthorID": "35740645200", "AffiliationID": "60034410", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pure and Applied Biology, Zoology Division, Bahauddin Zakariya University"}, "55649571160": {"Name": "Latif M.", "AuthorID": "55649571160", "AffiliationID": "60121158", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of the Education, Faisalabad Campus"}, "6701726706": {"Name": "Iqbal F.", "AuthorID": "6701726706", "AffiliationID": "60034410", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pure and Applied Biology, Zoology Division, Bahauddin Zakariya University"}, "55647598200": {"Name": "Ali M.", "AuthorID": "55647598200", "AffiliationID": "60034410", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Veterinary Sciences, Bahauddin Zakariya University"}, "6602104654": {"Name": "Shad M.A.", "AuthorID": "6602104654", "AffiliationID": "60034410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Bahauddin Zakariya University"}, "55484476700": {"Name": "Tabish T.A.", "AuthorID": "55484476700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}}}
