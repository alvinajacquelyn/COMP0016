Distributed Cognition has been proposed as a framework for understanding the design and use of medical devices. However, it is not clear that it has the analytic apparatus to support the investigation of such complexities. This paper proposes a framework that introduces concentric layers to DiCoT, a method that facilitates the application of Distributed Cognition theory. We use this to explore how an inpatient blood glucose meter is coupled with its context. The analysis is based on an observational study of clinicians using a newly introduced glucometer on an oncology ward over approximately 150. h (11. days and 4 nights). Using the framework we describe the basic mechanics of the system, incremental design considerations, and larger design considerations. The DiCoT concentric layers (DiCoT-CL) framework shows promise for analyzing the design and use of medical devices, and how they are coupled with their context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood glucose meter", "Distributed Cognition", "Ethnography", "Glucometer", "Human-computer interaction", "Socio-technical system"], "IndexKeywords": ["Blood glucose meters", "Distributed cognition", "Ethnography", "Glucometer", "Sociotechnical systems", "Algorithms", "Artifacts", "Blood Glucose", "Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring", "Cancer Care Facilities", "Cognition", "Data Collection", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Equipment and Supplies", "Equipment Design", "Medical Informatics", "Medical Oncology", "Research Design", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924515660", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"36165110400": {"Name": "Furniss D.", "AuthorID": "36165110400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC), University College London"}, "7004087556": {"Name": "Blandford A.", "AuthorID": "7004087556", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre (UCLIC), University College London"}, "55633702700": {"Name": "Masci P.", "AuthorID": "55633702700", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "16030450900": {"Name": "Curzon P.", "AuthorID": "16030450900", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7201374779": {"Name": "Mayer A.", "AuthorID": "7201374779", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Oncology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
