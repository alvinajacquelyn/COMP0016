The tests are performed on Hong Kong completely decomposed granite placed in a Rowe cell, with cement grout directly injected at the bottom of the cell from a pressure interface chamber. The soil specimens are tested under different initial stress and density conditions, either normally consolidated or overconsolidated. Different grouting pressures are used. The results indicate that a target volume of grout can be injected if the grout injection pressure is larger than the total stress by a magnitude at least equal to the effective stress. There is a tendency for the grout to propagate between the pile and the soil, with a residual densification of the soil after drainage. In loose soil, grouting has the effect of reducing the effective stress in the soil to zero, resulting in a homogeneous layer of grout between the shaft and soil. In denser specimens, fractures can occur parallel to the direction of minimum principal stress. A noticeable decrease in void ratio is achieved after grouting, due to both grout injection and drainage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Geotechnical engineering", "Grouting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compaction grouting", "Completely decomposed granite", "Effective stress", "Grout injection", "Grouting pressure", "Homogeneous layers", "Laboratory investigations", "Principal stress"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923696538", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"26658248500": {"Name": "Fattahpour V.", "AuthorID": "26658248500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong"}, "15841467600": {"Name": "Baudet B.", "AuthorID": "15841467600", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "The University of Hong Kong"}, "55340171300": {"Name": "Sze J.", "AuthorID": "55340171300", "AffiliationID": "60099927", "AffiliationName": "Ove Arup and Partners Hong Kong Limited"}}}
