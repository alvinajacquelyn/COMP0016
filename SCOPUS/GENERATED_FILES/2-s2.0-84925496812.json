However, to date, there is no single convention with respect to the terminology used to describe levels of liquid thickening or food texture modification for clinical use. As a first step toward building a common taxonomy, a systematic review was undertaken to identify empirical evidence describing the impact of liquid consistency and food texture on swallowing behavior. A multi-engine search yielded 10,147 non-duplicate articles, which were screened for relevance. A team of ten international researchers collaborated to conduct full-text reviews for 488 of these articles, which met the study inclusion criteria. Of these, 36 articles were found to contain specific information comparing oral processing or swallowing behaviors for at least two liquid consistencies or food textures. Qualitative synthesis revealed two key trends with respect to the impact of thickening liquids on swallowing: thicker liquids reduce the risk of penetration\u2013aspiration, but also increase the risk of post-swallow residue in the pharynx. The literature was insufficient to support the delineation of specific viscosity boundaries or other quantifiable material properties related to these clinical outcomes. With respect to food texture, the literature pointed to properties of hardness, cohesiveness, and slipperiness as being relevant both for physiological behaviors and bolus flow patterns. The literature suggests a need to classify food and fluid behavior in the context of the physiological processes involved in oral transport and flow initiation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deglutition", "Deglutition disorders", "Dysphagia", "Systematic review", "Texture modification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Deglutition", "Food", "Hardness", "Humans", "Risk Factors", "Viscosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925496812", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"7101798810": {"Name": "Steele C.M.", "AuthorID": "7101798810", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech-Language Pathology, University of Toronto"}, "12239962300": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "12239962300", "AffiliationID": "60012581", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang Gongshang University"}, "6603017513": {"Name": "Cichero J.A.Y.", "AuthorID": "6603017513", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, The University of Queensland"}, "7007153272": {"Name": "Dantas R.O.", "AuthorID": "7007153272", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Medical School of Ribeirao Preto - University of Sao Paulo"}, "55256140200": {"Name": "Duivestein J.", "AuthorID": "55256140200", "AffiliationID": "100318888", "AffiliationName": "Sunny Hill Health Centre"}, "7102037062": {"Name": "Hanson B.", "AuthorID": "7102037062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56402559100": {"Name": "Lam P.", "AuthorID": "56402559100", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Land and Food Systems, University of British Columbia"}, "16834888400": {"Name": "Lecko C.", "AuthorID": "16834888400", "AffiliationID": "60007904", "AffiliationName": "National Health Service Commissioning Board Special Health Authority"}, "56403137100": {"Name": "Barbon C.E.A.", "AuthorID": "56403137100", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech-Language Pathology, University of Toronto"}, "56403350100": {"Name": "Giosa L.", "AuthorID": "56403350100", "AffiliationID": "60030951, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Rehabilitation Institute \u2013 University Health Network"}, "55607010500": {"Name": "Leigh C.", "AuthorID": "55607010500", "AffiliationID": "60030951, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Rehabilitation Institute \u2013 University Health Network"}, "55607021500": {"Name": "Nagy A.", "AuthorID": "55607021500", "AffiliationID": "60027423", "AffiliationName": "Fayoum University"}, "56402946400": {"Name": "Namasivayam A.M.", "AuthorID": "56402946400", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech-Language Pathology, University of Toronto"}, "56402612600": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "56402612600", "AffiliationID": "60030951, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Rehabilitation Institute \u2013 University Health Network"}, "56053847300": {"Name": "Alsanei W.A.", "AuthorID": "56053847300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Food Science and Nutrition, University of Leeds"}, "56403279900": {"Name": "Ayanikalath S.", "AuthorID": "56403279900", "AffiliationID": "60070809", "AffiliationName": "Sheikh Khalifa Medical City"}, "56403047700": {"Name": "Coutts K.", "AuthorID": "56403047700", "AffiliationID": "60030575", "AffiliationName": "Helen Joseph Hospital"}, "36698258700": {"Name": "Nascimento W.V.", "AuthorID": "36698258700", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Medical School of Ribeirao Preto - University of Sao Paulo"}, "56403223400": {"Name": "Odendaal I.", "AuthorID": "56403223400", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "57154237300": {"Name": "Smith C.H.", "AuthorID": "57154237300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
