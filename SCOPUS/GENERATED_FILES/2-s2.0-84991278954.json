Development of screening algorithms for cardiovascular disorders appropriate to a resource-constrained setting could facilitate timely referral. Cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) on chest radiograph (CXR) has been suggested as a potential screening tool but little is known about its reproducibility and stability. Our primary aim was to evaluate the stability and the inter-observer variability of CTR in HIV-1 infected outpatients. We further evaluated the prevalence of cardiomegaly (CTR\u22650.5) and its relationship with other risk factors in this population. Methodology HIV-1 infected participants were identified during screening for a tuberculosis vaccine trial in Khayelitsha, South Africa between August 2011 and April 2012. Participants had a digital posterior-anterior CXR performed as well as history, examination and baseline observations. CXRs were viewed using OsiriX software and CTR calculated using digital callipers. Results 450 HIV-1-infected adults were evaluated, median age 34 years (IQR 30-40) with a CD4 count 566/mm3 (IQR 443-724), 70% on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The prevalence of cardiomegaly was 12.7% (95% C.I. 9.6%-15.8%). CTR was calculated by a 2nd reader for 113 participants, measurements were highly correlated r = 0.95 (95% C.I. 0.93-0.97) and agreement of cardiomegaly substantial \u03ba = 0.78 (95% C.I 0.61-0.95). CXR were repeated in 51 participants at 4-12 weeks, CTR measurements between the 2 time points were highly correlated r = 0.77 (95% C.I 0.68-0.88) and agreement of cardiomegaly excellent \u03ba = 0.92 (95% C.I. 0.77-1). Participants with cardiomegaly had a higher median BMI (31.3; IQR 27.4-37.4) versus 26.9; IQR 23.2-32.4); p<0.0001) and median systolic blood pressure (130; IQR 121-141 versus 125; IQR 117-135; p = 0.01). Conclusion CTR is a robust measurement, stable over time with substantial inter-observer agreement. A prospective study evaluating utility of CXR to identify cardiovascular disorder in this population is warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cardiomegaly", "Female", "Health Resources", "Heart Diseases", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Organ Size", "Radiography, Thoracic", "Reproducibility of Results", "Risk Factors", "South Africa"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991278954", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"20433723200": {"Name": "Esmail H.", "AuthorID": "20433723200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "26658541700": {"Name": "Oni T.", "AuthorID": "26658541700", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health and Family Medicine, Division of Public Health Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "6504339504": {"Name": "Thienemann F.", "AuthorID": "6504339504", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "57191512228": {"Name": "Omar-Davies N.", "AuthorID": "57191512228", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious Diseases and Molecular Medicine, Clinical Infectious Disease Research Initiative, University of Cape Town"}, "7402272158": {"Name": "Wilkinson R.J.", "AuthorID": "7402272158", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory"}, "11340073300": {"Name": "Ntsekhe M.", "AuthorID": "11340073300", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Cardiology, University of Cape Town"}}}
