We have previously published two-year follow-up data of a randomised controlled trial (RCT), in which 50 patients with primary osteoarthritis were randomised to either retention or removal of the SCBP. The mean age of the retention group (n = 25, 13 males) was 70.0 years (SD 6.8). The mean age in the removal group (n = 25, 16 males) was 70.3 years (SD 7.9). Now we have followed up the patients at six (retention group, n = 21; removal group, n = 20) and ten years (retention group: n = 17, removal group: n = 18), administering clinical outcome questionnaires and radiostereometric analysis (RSA), and determining the presence of radiolucent lines (RLLs) on conventional radiographs. RSA demonstrated similar translation and rotation patterns up to six years. Between six and ten years, proximal acetabular component migration and changes of inclination were larger in the retention group, although the mean differences did not reach statistical significance. Differences in migration were driven by two patients in the SCBP retention group with extensive migration versus none in the SCBP removal group. The significant difference (p < 0.001) in the development of radiolucent lines in the retention group, previously observed at two years, increased even further during the course of follow-up (p < 0.001). While recognising SCBP removal is a more demanding technique, we conclude that, wherever possible, the SCBP should be removed to improve the cement-bone interface in order to maximise acetabular component stability and longevity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925356843", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"6602760953": {"Name": "Flivik G.", "AuthorID": "6602760953", "AffiliationID": "60014077, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Skane University Hospital, Lund University"}, "16203030200": {"Name": "Kristiansson I.", "AuthorID": "16203030200", "AffiliationID": "60014077, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Skane University Hospital, Lund University"}, "7005513100": {"Name": "Ryd L.", "AuthorID": "7005513100", "AffiliationID": "60014077, 60029170", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, Skane University Hospital, Lund University"}}}
