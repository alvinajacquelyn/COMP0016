The authors set out to characterize the demographics and determine the motivation of 'early adopters' of this specialty by retrospectively reviewing the application forms of students enrolled on the UCL Perioperative Medicine Masters Programme. A total of 139 applications were reviewed. The median age of applicants was 35 years; 81% were UK based, with the remainder from a worldwide distribution. Seventeen per cent were consultant anaesthetists and 64% anaesthetic trainees, with the remainder including doctors from other specialties (17%) and nurses (2%). Qualitative analysis using grounded theory methodology revealed common motivational themes: the belief that perioperative medicine would lead to better patient care, that it represents the future working practice for anaesthetists, a desire to be able to better lead local developments, and personal fulfilment and benefit. The responses provided insight into the motivation of an international cohort of professionals. Perioperative medicine was perceived as a developing multidisciplinary specialty that will lead to better patient care. Applicants understood the importance of perioperative care extending beyond the operating theatre which may explain the growing demand for training in perioperative medicine.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Clinical Competence", "Consultants", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "Female", "General Surgery", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Motivation", "Operating Rooms", "Perioperative Care", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034107258", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57197721961": {"Name": "Groves C.", "AuthorID": "57197721961", "AffiliationID": "60007800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Barking Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals"}, "36555073400": {"Name": "Whiteman A.", "AuthorID": "36555073400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College London Hospitals"}, "55430370000": {"Name": "Kumar G.", "AuthorID": "55430370000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College London Hospitals"}, "7401884627": {"Name": "Stephens R.", "AuthorID": "7401884627", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College London Hospitals"}, "36734984300": {"Name": "Walker D.", "AuthorID": "36734984300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, University College London Hospitals"}}}
