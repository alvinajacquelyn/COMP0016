Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts the event study methodology to assess the abnormal returns (ARs). Pre- and post-cross-listing changes in the risk exposure for the domestic and foreign markets are examined, via a modified two-factor international asset pricing model. A comparison is made for two broad cross-listings, namely, the depositary receipts and the dual ordinary listings, to examine the impacts from institutional differences. Findings: Cross-listed REITs generally experience positive and significant ARs throughout the event window, implying significant superior returns associated with the cross-listing for REITs. On systematic risks, REITs exhibit significant decline in their domestic market \u03b2 coefficients after the cross-listing. However, the foreign market \u03b2 coefficients do not yield conclusive evidence when compared across the sample. Research limitations/implications: Results are consistent with prudential asset allocation for potential diversification gains from the cross-listing, as the reduction from the domestic market beta is more significant than changes in the foreign market beta. Practical implications: The results and findings should incentivise REIT managers to explore viable cross-listing. Social implications: Such cross-listing for REITs should enhance risk diversification. Originality/value: This is a pioneer study on cross-listing of REITs. It provides a basis for investment decision making, and could provoke further research and discussion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asia", "Cross-listing", "Event study methodology", "International asset pricing model", "REITs", "USA and Europe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028302475", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"16039319200": {"Name": "Ho K.H.D.", "AuthorID": "16039319200", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Real Estate, National University of Singapore"}, "56152324200": {"Name": "Addae-Dapaah K.", "AuthorID": "56152324200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "57195475392": {"Name": "Peck F.R.L.", "AuthorID": "57195475392", "AffiliationID": "60099796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Investment Sales, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd"}}}
