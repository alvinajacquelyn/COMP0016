This chapter summarizes a short OCT protocol as included in international consensus guidelines. The protocol was written for hands-on style such that both clinicians and OCT technicians can make use of it. The protocol is suitable for imaging of the optic nerve head and macular regions as a baseline for follow-up investigations, individual layer segmentation, and diagnostic assessment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multiple sclerosis", "Neurodegeneration", "Optic neuritis", "Optical coherence tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Optic Nerve", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938879332", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
