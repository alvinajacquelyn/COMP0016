We sought to characterize the relationship between postural BP responses and the kidney. Methods and Results- We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 4204 participants from The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults aged \u226550 years. Beat-to-beat systolic and diastolic BP were measured during a 2-minute active stand test. The primary predictor was cystatin C estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) categorized as follows (mL/min per 1.73 m2): \u226590 (reference, n=1414); 75 to 89 (n=1379); 60 to 74 (n=942); 45 to 59 (n=337); < 45 (n=132). We examined the association between eGFR categories and (1) sustained orthostatic hypotension, defined as a BP drop exceeding consensus thresholds (systolic BP drop \u226520 mm Hg\u00b1diastolic BP drop \u226510 mm Hg) at each 10-second interval from 60 to 110 seconds inclusive; (2) pattern of BP stabilization, characterized as the difference from baseline in mean systolic BP/diastolic BP at 10-second intervals. The mean age of subjects was 61.6 years; 47% of subjects were male, and the median eGFR was 82 mL/min per 1.73 m2. After multivariable adjustment, participants with eGFR < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 were approximately twice as likely to have sustained orthostatic hypotension (P=0.008 for trend across eGFR categories). We observed a graded association between eGFR categories and impaired orthostatic BP stabilization, particularly within the first minute of standing. Conclusions- We report a novel, graded relationship between diminished eGFR and impaired orthostatic BP stabilization. Mapping the postural BP response merits further study in kidney disease as a potential means of identifying those at risk of hypotensionrelated events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood pressure measurement/monitoring", "Cystatin C", "Glomerular filtration rate", "Hypotension", "Kidney", "Low blood pressure", "Orthostatic hypotension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Blood Pressure", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Cystatin C", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Hypotension, Orthostatic", "Ireland", "Kidney", "Linear Models", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Odds Ratio", "Posture", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019388723", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"6506149463": {"Name": "Canney M.", "AuthorID": "6506149463", "AffiliationID": "60120406", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Tallaght Hospital"}, "9532868400": {"Name": "O'Connell M.D.L.", "AuthorID": "9532868400", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), Trinity College Dublin"}, "9243776400": {"Name": "Sexton D.J.", "AuthorID": "9243776400", "AffiliationID": "60120406", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Tallaght Hospital"}, "25958772300": {"Name": "O'Leary N.", "AuthorID": "25958772300", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), Trinity College Dublin"}, "57214210019": {"Name": "Kenny R.A.", "AuthorID": "57214210019", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA), Trinity College Dublin"}, "26643059400": {"Name": "Little M.A.", "AuthorID": "26643059400", "AffiliationID": "60120406", "AffiliationName": "Trinity Health Kidney Centre, Tallaght Hospital"}, "11639106300": {"Name": "O'Seaghdha C.M.", "AuthorID": "11639106300", "AffiliationID": "60000718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Beaumont Hospital"}}}
