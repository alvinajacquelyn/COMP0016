Methods: Eighty patients completed ratings of baseline assessments and one- and five-year expectations of pain, stiffness and physical function using the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Measures of illness perceptions, coping styles, health values, satisfaction, quality of life, optimism, self-esteem and moods were also collected at baseline. Agreement between patients' current assessment and expectations were calculated using intra-class correlations (ICCs). Paired-sample t-tests were conducted to look at differences between assessments. Univariate logistic regressions were then performed to identify the variables significantly associated with positive expectations of pain, stiffness and function. Significant variables (p<0.05) were entered into a forward stepwise multivariate logistic regression to identify unique independent predictors of positive expectations for each of the WOMAC subscales. Results: Differences were found between current assessments and expectations, with the majority of patients being positive about future symptoms. There were some differences between the predictors for one- and five-year expectations, with current assessments of health status only affecting five-year expectations. Conclusions: It is necessary to investigate further the variables that may contribute to positive expectations in osteoarthritis patients in order to manage the condition more effectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Function", "Osteoarthritis", "Pain", "Patient expectations", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Affect", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Osteoarthritis, Hip", "Osteoarthritis, Knee", "Pain", "Quality of Life", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Self Concept", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84932199601", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Chiropractics", "HEAL", "3602"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Nursing (miscellaneous)", "NURS", "2901"]], "AuthorData": {"56454483700": {"Name": "Dwek M.R.", "AuthorID": "56454483700", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University London"}, "55251873500": {"Name": "Mcbain H.", "AuthorID": "55251873500", "AffiliationID": "60099152", "AffiliationName": "Community Health Newham, East London Foundation Trust"}, "55808072084": {"Name": "Newman S.", "AuthorID": "55808072084", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University London"}, "55171517400": {"Name": "Cleanthous S.", "AuthorID": "55171517400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology Research, Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "7103265839": {"Name": "Shipley M.", "AuthorID": "7103265839", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}}}
