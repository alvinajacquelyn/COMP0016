From an experimental perspective, the measurement of materials comprising multiple domains can complicate the interpretation of the material properties and their underlying mechanisms. In general, BiFeO3 films tend to grow with multiple magnetic domains and often contain multiple ferroelectric- and ferroelastic-domain variants. By growing (111)-oriented BiFeO3 films on an orthorhombic TbScO3 substrate, we are able to overcome this and, by exploiting the magnetoelastic coupling between the magnetic and crystal structures, bias the growth of a given magnetic-, ferroelectric-, and structural-domain film. We further demonstrate the coupling of the magnetic structure to the ferroelectric polarization by showing that the magnetic polarity in this domain is inverted upon 180 ferroelectric switching.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Device application", "Ferroelastic domains", "Ferroelectric polarization", "Ferroelectric switching", "Macroscopic properties", "Magnetoelastic couplings", "Strain engineering", "Structural domains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062016903", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191625860": {"Name": "Waterfield Price N.", "AuthorID": "57191625860", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "57194019782": {"Name": "Vibhakar A.M.", "AuthorID": "57194019782", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "55838510125": {"Name": "Johnson R.D.", "AuthorID": "55838510125", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57191830751": {"Name": "Chmiel F.P.", "AuthorID": "57191830751", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "7005828246": {"Name": "Radaelli P.G.", "AuthorID": "7005828246", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "57203707501": {"Name": "Schad J.", "AuthorID": "57203707501", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "55272273500": {"Name": "Saenrang W.", "AuthorID": "55272273500", "AffiliationID": "60026326", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Institute of Science, Suranaree University of Technology"}, "7006759486": {"Name": "Eom C.B.", "AuthorID": "7006759486", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "56057964700": {"Name": "Bombardi A.", "AuthorID": "56057964700", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
