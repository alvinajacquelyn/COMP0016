Method: This was a randomized, parallel arms, placebo-contolled trial. Children with hypertonic CP aged 2 to 15 years awaiting bony hip surgery at a tertiary hospital were randomized to receive either BoNT-A or placebo injections into the muscles of the hip on a single occasion immediately before surgery. The primary outcome was the paediatric pain profile (PPP), which was assessed at baseline and weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment allocation was by minimization. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were masked to group assignment. Results: Twenty-seven participants (17 males, 10 females; mean 8y 8mo [SD 3y 9mo], range 3y 4mo\u201315y 10mo) were allocated to BoNT-A and 27 participants (14 males, 13 females; mean 8y 11mo [SD 3y 5mo], range 4y 1mo\u201315y 2mo) to placebo. Mean (SD) PPP at 6 weeks for the BoNT-A group (n=24 followed up) was 10.96 (7.22) and for the placebo group (n=26) was 10.04 (8.54) (p=0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] \u20134.82, 3.18). There were 16 serious adverse events in total during 6 months of follow-up (n=6 in BoNT-A group). Interpretation: Use of BoNT-A immediately before bony hip surgery for reducing postoperative pain for children with CP was not supported. What this paper adds: Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) does not reduce postoperative pain following bony hip surgery. BoNT-A also does not affect postoperative quality of life.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Botulinum Toxins, Type A", "Cerebral Palsy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Hip Joint", "Humans", "Male", "Neuromuscular Agents", "Orthopedic Procedures", "Pain, Postoperative", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060144246", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"15844513400": {"Name": "Will E.", "AuthorID": "15844513400", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "57205467347": {"Name": "Arnold R.", "AuthorID": "57205467347", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "57220939752": {"Name": "Davies M.", "AuthorID": "57220939752", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "15076634900": {"Name": "Fairhurst C.", "AuthorID": "15076634900", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "6602703056": {"Name": "Norman-Taylor F.", "AuthorID": "6602703056", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Evelina London Children's Hospital"}, "56047134200": {"Name": "Magill N.", "AuthorID": "56047134200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7005557932": {"Name": "Doherty G.", "AuthorID": "7005557932", "AffiliationID": "60028697", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"}, "15832173200": {"Name": "Lundy C.", "AuthorID": "15832173200", "AffiliationID": "60028697", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children"}, "6603924672": {"Name": "Roposch A.", "AuthorID": "6603924672", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
