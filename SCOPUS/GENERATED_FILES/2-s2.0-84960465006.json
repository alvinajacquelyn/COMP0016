The aim of the study was to compare the outcome of open and laparoscopic appendectomies during a transition period. Materials and methods This was a retrospective cohort study with prospectively collected data. All patients who underwent an operation for suspected appendicitis at the Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital in Stockholm between 2006 and 2010 were included in the study. Results 1745 children were included in this study, of whom 1010 had a laparoscopic intervention. There were no significant differences in the rate of postoperative abscesses, wound infections, readmissions or reoperations between the two groups. The median operating time was longer for laparoscopic appendectomy than for open appendectomy, 51 vs. 37 minutes (p < 0.05). The postoperative length of stay was similar in the two groups. A simple comparison between the groups suggested that laparoscopic appendectomy had a shorter median postoperative length of stay, 43 vs. 57 hours (p < 0.05). However, there was a trend in time for a shorter postoperative length of stay, and a trend for more of the procedures to be performed laparoscopically over time so on regression analysis, the apparent decrease in length of stay with laparoscopy could be ascribed to the general trend toward decreased length of stay over time, with no specific additional effect of laparoscopy. Conclusions Our data show no difference in outcome between open and laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis in children in regard of complications. The initial assumption that the patients treated with laparoscopic surgery had a shorter postoperative stay was not confirmed with linear regression, which showed that the assumed difference was due only to a trend toward shorter postoperative length of stay over time, regardless of the surgical intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Appendicitis", "Children", "Laparoscopy", "Open surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adolescent", "Appendectomy", "Appendicitis", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Laparoscopy", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Operative Time", "Postoperative Complications", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960465006", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"7103073053": {"Name": "Svensson J.", "AuthorID": "7103073053", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56291009100": {"Name": "Patkova B.", "AuthorID": "56291009100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet"}, "23979271400": {"Name": "Almstr\u00f6m M.", "AuthorID": "23979271400", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet"}, "8773547300": {"Name": "Wester T.", "AuthorID": "8773547300", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Surgery Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
