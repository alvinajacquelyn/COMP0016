Twenty-two Korean learners of English as a foreign language were divided into three groups (FFI-only, FFI-recasts, FFI-prompts). Each group received 4 h of instruction in which they were taught how to structure an argument in English through activities designed to simultaneously focus their attention on /r/, including explicit articulatory instruction. All lessons were video-recorded, which allowed all instances of feedback and learner response to be identified and coded. Production was measured through both spontaneous and controlled tests, and judged by five trained English native-speaking listeners. According to the results of the pre/post-tests, recasts were especially helpful in the improvement of controlled production of /r/, whereas prompts were facilitative of not only controlled but also spontaneous production of /r/. The results of the video-coding analysis further demonstrated that, during instruction, students were pushed by prompts to improve intelligibility mainly through the adjustment of interlanguage strategies (e.g., prolonging the phonemic length), and by recasts to refine accuracy in their /r/ production.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corrective feedback", "English /r/", "FFI", "Prompts", "Pronunciation", "Recasts", "SLA"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977515947", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57190130911": {"Name": "Gooch R.", "AuthorID": "57190130911", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrated Studies in Education, McGill University"}, "55949543300": {"Name": "Lyster R.", "AuthorID": "55949543300", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrated Studies in Education, McGill University"}, "36515364100": {"Name": "Saito K.", "AuthorID": "36515364100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Linguistics and Communication, University of London"}}}
