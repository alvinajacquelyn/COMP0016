All rights reserved.Low-cost semiconductor photocatalysts that can efficiently harvest solar energy and generate H2 from water or biofuels will be critical to future hydrogen economies. Here, we evaluate the performance of low-cost Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts (Ni loadings 0-4 wt.%) for H2 production from ethanol-water mixtures (0-100 vol.% EtOH) under UV excitation. Ni(II) was deposited on P25 TiO2 by the complex precipitation method, followed by H2 reduction at 500 \u00b0C for 2 h to obtain Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts. TGA, TEM, XRD, Ni 2p XPS, Ni L-edge NEXAFS, Ni K-edge EXAFS, UV-Vis and photoluminescence measurements confirmed that Ni0 was the dominant nickel species on the surface of the Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts, with the Ni particle size \u223c1-2 nm. The photocatalytic activity of Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts was highly dependent on the Ni loading, with the optimal Ni loading being 0.5 wt.%, which afforded a H2 production rate of 11.6 mmol g-1 h-1 (or 0.258 mmol m-2 h-1) at an EtOH:H2O volume ratio of 10:90 and a UV flux comparable to that in sunlight. High H2 production rates were achieved over a wide range of EtOH:H2O concentrations, with a 95:5 volume ratio affording the highest rate (24.3 mmol g-1 h-1). The 0.5 wt.% Ni/TiO2 photocatalyst displayed superior photocatalytic activity to a 2 wt.% Au/TiO2 reference photocatalyst at low ethanol concentrations (1-15 vol.%), which is attributed to the high co-catalyst dispersion achieved in the Ni/TiO2 system. Results suggest that Ni/TiO2 photocatalysts are promising alternatives to M/TiO2 (M = Pd, Pt or Au) photocatalysts for solar H2 production from biofuels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethanol", "Hydrogen production", "Nickel", "Photocatalysis", "TiO2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex precipitation", "Ethanol concentrations", "Ethanol water mixtures", "Photocatalytic activities", "Photocatalytic systems", "Photoluminescence measurements", "Semiconductor photocatalyst", "TiO2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928799444", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55785273400": {"Name": "Chen W.T.", "AuthorID": "55785273400", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "56482613800": {"Name": "Chan A.", "AuthorID": "56482613800", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "24436943000": {"Name": "Sun-Waterhouse D.", "AuthorID": "24436943000", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "7003557732": {"Name": "Waterhouse G.I.N.", "AuthorID": "7003557732", "AffiliationID": "60093471", "AffiliationName": "MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology"}, "7006799068": {"Name": "Moriga T.", "AuthorID": "7006799068", "AffiliationID": "60009852", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Advanced Technology and Science, University of Tokushima"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SABIC, Corporate Research Institute (CRI), KAUST"}}}
