A two-part switching control strategy is proposed, in which the constant control is used to steer the system state to enter the convergence domain, while the control law which is designed based on Lyapunov stability theorem is used to attract the system state in convergence domain to the target state. The convergence of the switching control is strictly proved. Moreover, the numerical experiments on a three dimensional stochastic quantum system are implemented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the control proposed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["global stabilization", "mixed states", "stochastic quantum systems", "switching control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Convergence domains", "Global stabilization", "Lyapunov stability theorem", "Mixed state", "Numerical experiments", "Quantum system", "Switching Control", "Switching control strategy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044259050", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"7005067661": {"Name": "Cong S.", "AuthorID": "7005067661", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "57209841595": {"Name": "Wen J.", "AuthorID": "57209841595", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "55555836100": {"Name": "Meng F.", "AuthorID": "55555836100", "AffiliationID": "60104664", "AffiliationName": "Hefei University"}, "55488020900": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "55488020900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}}}
