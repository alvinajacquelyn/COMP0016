To correlate the THz emission with the photo-excited charge density distribution and the photo-current direction, we mapped near-field and far-field distributions of the generated THz waves from GaAs and Fe-doped InGaAs surfaces. The experimental results show that the charge dynamics in the plane of the surface can radiate substantially stronger THz pulses than the charge dynamics in the direction normal to the surface, which is generally regarded as the dominant origin of the emission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aperture", "Dember effect", "emission pattern", "far-field radiation pattern", "near-field microscopy", "near-field radiation", "pulse generation", "terahertz"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aperture", "Dember effects", "Emission pattern", "Far field radiation patterns", "Near field microscopy", "Near field radiation", "Pulse generation", "Tera Hertz"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924593929", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36976025700": {"Name": "Mueckstein R.", "AuthorID": "36976025700", "AffiliationID": "60114858", "AffiliationName": "Sirona Dental Systems GmbH"}, "55312030000": {"Name": "Natrella M.", "AuthorID": "55312030000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "25921429900": {"Name": "Freeman J.", "AuthorID": "25921429900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "53866442400": {"Name": "Graham C.", "AuthorID": "53866442400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7005415578": {"Name": "Linfield E.", "AuthorID": "7005415578", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "56911604400": {"Name": "Davies A.", "AuthorID": "56911604400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7003451569": {"Name": "Mitrofanov O.", "AuthorID": "7003451569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "35292565000": {"Name": "Hatem O.", "AuthorID": "35292565000", "AffiliationID": "60011568", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Physics and Mathematics, Tanta University"}, "6602609953": {"Name": "Cannard P.", "AuthorID": "6602609953", "AffiliationID": "60118521", "AffiliationName": "CIP Technologies (Now Huawei)"}, "57206508022": {"Name": "Robertson M.", "AuthorID": "57206508022", "AffiliationID": "60118521", "AffiliationName": "CIP Technologies (Now Huawei)"}, "7102297209": {"Name": "Moodie D.", "AuthorID": "7102297209", "AffiliationID": "60118521", "AffiliationName": "CIP Technologies (Now Huawei)"}}}
