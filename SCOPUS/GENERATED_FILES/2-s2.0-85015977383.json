It has been known for a long time that the quasi-classical asymptotics for traces of resulting operators strongly depend on the smoothness of the symbol: for smooth symbols the expansion is power-like, whereas discontinuous symbols (e.g. indicator functions) produce an extra logarithmic factor. We investigate the transition regime by studying symbols depending on an extra parameter T\u2265 0 in such a way that the symbol tends to a discontinuous one as T\u2192 0. The main result is two-parameter asymptotics (in the quasi-classical parameter and in T), describing a transition from the smooth case to the discontinuous one. The obtained asymptotic formulas are used to analyse the low-temperature scaling limit of the spatially bipartite entanglement entropy of thermal equilibrium states of non-interacting fermions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymptotic trace formulas", "Entanglement entropy", "Non-smooth functions of Wiener\u2013Hopf operators"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015977383", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"]], "AuthorData": {"16644000200": {"Name": "Sobolev A.", "AuthorID": "16644000200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
