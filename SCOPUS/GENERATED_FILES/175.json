Whilst effective and generally safe, anti- CD 20 antibody therapy is increasingly recognised to result in unusual infectious complications to be considered in a treated patient presenting with neurological symptoms. These cases may pose diagnostic difficulties and can have atypical presentations. We present this rare complication of rituximab therapy, with histopathological confirmation of myofasciitis. In the older literature, enterovirus associated myofasciitis may have erroneously been termed dermatomyositis and we review the literature to demonstrate this important nosological point.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Echovirus", "Hypogammaglobulinaemia", "Meningitis", "Myofasciitis", "Rituximab"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Deafness", "Enterovirus Infections", "Fasciitis", "Humans", "Lymphoma, Follicular", "Male", "Meningitis, Viral", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Myositis", "Rituximab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930674748", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55293261100": {"Name": "Healy E.G.", "AuthorID": "55293261100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology, MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "26535084400": {"Name": "Phadke R.", "AuthorID": "26535084400", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56673703300": {"Name": "Kidd M.", "AuthorID": "56673703300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
