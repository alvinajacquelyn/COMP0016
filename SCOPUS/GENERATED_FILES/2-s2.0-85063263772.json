Despite their common clinical use, little is known about the effects of b-blockers on free intracellular calcium (Ca2i1), an important cytosolic second messenger and a key regulator of cell function. We investigated the role of four chemical analogs, commonly prescribed b-blockers (atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol, and sotalol), on Ca2i1 release and whole-cell currents in mammalian cancer cells (PC3 prostate cancer and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines). We discovered that only propranolol activated free Ca2i1 release with distinct kinetics, whereas atenolol, metoprolol, and sotalol did not. The propranolol-induced Ca2i1 release was significantly inhibited by the chelation of extracellular calcium with ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and by dantrolene, an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ryanodine receptor channels, and it was completely abolished by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, an inhibitor of the ER inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor channels. Exhaustion of ER stores with 4-chloro-m-cresol, a ryanodine receptor activator, or thapsigargin, a sarco/ER Ca21 ATPase inhibitor, precluded the propranolol-induced Ca2i1 release. Finally, preincubation of cells with sotalol or timolol, nonselective blockers of b-adrenoceptors, also reduced the Ca2i1 release activated by propranolol. Our results show that different b-blockers have differential effects on whole-cell currents and free Ca2i1 release and that propranolol activates store-operated Ca2i1 release via a mechanism that involves calcium-induced calcium release and putative downstream transducers such as IP3. The differential action of class II antiarrhythmics on Ca2i1 release may have implications on the pharmacology of these drugs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents", "Calcium", "Humans", "Intracellular Space", "Kinetics", "MCF-7 Cells", "PC-3 Cells", "Propranolol", "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063263772", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57196369611": {"Name": "Reyes-Corral M.", "AuthorID": "57196369611", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, MRC Centre for Transplantation, King\u2019s College London"}, "7201405986": {"Name": "Dasgupta P.", "AuthorID": "7201405986", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, MRC Centre for Transplantation, King\u2019s College London"}, "56904385200": {"Name": "Ahmed A.", "AuthorID": "56904385200", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, MRC Centre for Transplantation, King\u2019s College London"}, "57207927900": {"Name": "S\u00f8rensen N.M.", "AuthorID": "57207927900", "AffiliationID": "100409251", "AffiliationName": "Sophion Bioscience A/S"}, "6602690023": {"Name": "Thrasivoulou C.", "AuthorID": "6602690023", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7006771960": {"Name": "Ashmore J.F.", "AuthorID": "7006771960", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
