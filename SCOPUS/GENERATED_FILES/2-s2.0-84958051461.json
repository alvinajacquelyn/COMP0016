Unlike normally distributed attributes of the population, these urban elements often scale according to forces that determine large numbers of small elements and a small number of large ones. While many objects evolve from small to large, not all objects can be large as resources as well as physical limits determine the distribution of their sizes. The theory behind such size distributions is referred to as scaling and the shape of such distributions is quite well-defined by various power and exponential laws. As objects grow and evolve, or are even designed, their form changes qualitatively due to the forces of competition and the constraints on space. Here we explore these ideas for cities, neighbourhoods in towns, and buildings, specifically high buildings, revealing that there are both important differences as well as similarities in their form, function, and structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building heights", "City populations", "Power laws", "Random growth", "Rank size", "Scaling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958051461", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"7005713858": {"Name": "Batty M.", "AuthorID": "7005713858", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London"}}}
