Such attitudes are evaluations which occur with or without conscious awareness, respectively. This investigation examined participants\u2019 (N = 234) attitudes towards individuals with intellectual disabilities with reference to participants\u2019 gender, age, level of education, frequency of contact and closeness. Method: UK adults completed explicit (ATTID) and implicit attitude (ST-IAT) measures, and provided demographics via an online survey. Results: Participant demographics predicted explicit attitudes\u2014with differing cognitive, affective and behavioural associations. Contact frequency was most significant. Implicit attitudes were not predicted, evidencing implicit\u2013explicit attitude differences. Conclusions: The results encourage more implicit\u2013explicit attitude relationship research regarding disability. The associations between demographics, contact and implicit attitudes should be explored further. Research should question whether implicit attitudes reflect participants\u2019 true beliefs\u2014denoting less importance to demographics\u2014or whether they reflect wider societal values rather than individuals\u2019 attitudes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["attitudes", "contact", "demographics", "frequency", "intellectual disability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prejudice", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034746490", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57197779495": {"Name": "Murch A.J.", "AuthorID": "57197779495", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57197781456": {"Name": "Choudhury T.", "AuthorID": "57197781456", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57203760598": {"Name": "Collerton E.", "AuthorID": "57203760598", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57188836020": {"Name": "Patel M.", "AuthorID": "57188836020", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "55482053600": {"Name": "Wilson M.", "AuthorID": "55482053600", "AffiliationID": "60171196", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Weight Management Service for Kensington and Chelsea, Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "6507888355": {"Name": "Scior K.", "AuthorID": "6507888355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychology, University College London"}}}
