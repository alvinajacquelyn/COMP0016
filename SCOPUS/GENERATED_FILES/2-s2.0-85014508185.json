We aimed to develop the Social Functioning in Dementia (SF-DEM) scale and test its psychometric properties for assessing social function in people with dementia. Methods We interviewed people with mild dementia and family caregivers to develop patient and caregiver-rated SF-DEM versions and refined them through interviews with health care professionals. We tested its psychometric properties in 30 dyads of people with dementia and family caregivers. Results Both SF-DEM versions had content validity and demonstrated concurrent validity against a single item rating overall social functioning (patient rated r = 0.42, 95% CI [0.07\u20130.68]; caregiver rated r = 0.59, 95% CI [0.29\u20130.78]). All participants found it acceptable. Analyses showed reliability (test\u2013retest, inter-rater, internal consistency) and indications of responsiveness to change. Discussion SF-DEM shows promise as a valid, reliable, acceptable measure of social functioning in dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment tool", "Dementia", "Outcome assessment", "Social functioning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014508185", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56107100900": {"Name": "Sommerlad A.", "AuthorID": "56107100900", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}, "57193511575": {"Name": "Singleton D.", "AuthorID": "57193511575", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57192098590": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "57192098590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7006347341": {"Name": "Livingston G.", "AuthorID": "7006347341", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}, "7404539568": {"Name": "Banerjee S.", "AuthorID": "7404539568", "AffiliationID": "60017317, 60100018", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Dementia Studies, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex"}}}
