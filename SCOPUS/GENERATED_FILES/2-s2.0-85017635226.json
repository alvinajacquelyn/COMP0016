The frequency and intensity of landslides are increasing over time because of heavy rainfall occurring over a few days. Furthermore, rapid urbanization through hill-cutting is another factor, which is believed to have a significant impact on the occurrence of landslides. This study aims to develop landslide susceptibility maps (LSMs) through the use of Dempster-Shafer weights of evidence (WoE) and the multiple regression (MR) method. Three different combinations with principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy membership techniques were used and tested. Twelve factor maps (i.e., slope, hill-cutting, geology, geomorphology, NDVI, soil moisture, precipitation and distance from existing buildings, stream, road and drainage network, and faults-lineaments) were prepared based on their association with historical landslide events. A landslide inventory map was prepared through field surveys for model simulation and validation purposes. The performance of the predicted LSMs was validated using the area under the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curve method. The overall success rates were 87.3%, 90.9%, 91.3%, and 93.9%, respectively for the WoE, MR with all the layers, MR with PCA layers, and MR with fuzzy probability layers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cartography", "GIS", "Landslides", "Regression statistics", "Remote sensing", "Weights of evidence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fuzzy probability", "Landslide inventories", "Landslide susceptibility", "Multiple regressions", "Multivariate statistical techniques", "Rapid urbanizations", "Relative operating characteristics", "Weights of evidences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017635226", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55919919600": {"Name": "Ahmed B.", "AuthorID": "55919919600", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disaster Science and Management, Faculty of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Dhaka"}, "15925234800": {"Name": "Dewan A.", "AuthorID": "15925234800", "AffiliationID": "60084455, 60031226", "AffiliationName": "Department of Spatial Sciences, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Curtin University"}}}
