Using complementary microscopic techniques, we here show evidence of such self-organization of the actin cortex in living HeLa cells. During cell adhesion, an active multistage process naturally leads to pattern transitions from actin vortices over stars into asters. This process is primarily driven by Arp2/3 complex nucleation, but not by myosin motors, which is in contrast to what has been theoretically predicted and observed in vitro. Concomitant measurements of mechanics and plasma membrane fluidity demonstrate that changes in actin patterning alter membrane architecture but occur functionally independent of macroscopic cortex elasticity. Consequently, tuning the activity of the Arp2/3 complex to alter filament assembly may thus be a mechanism allowing cells to adjust their membrane architecture without affecting their macroscopic mechanical properties.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Actin-Related Protein 2-3 Complex", "Actins", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Membrane", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Mechanical Phenomena", "Membrane Fluidity", "Microscopy, Atomic Force", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Conformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012253310", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36463357100": {"Name": "Fritzsche M.", "AuthorID": "36463357100", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "56966690100": {"Name": "Colin-York H.", "AuthorID": "56966690100", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "14319036200": {"Name": "Chang V.T.", "AuthorID": "14319036200", "AffiliationID": "60099539, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Structural Biology, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "43861193400": {"Name": "Felce J.H.", "AuthorID": "43861193400", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "55154490500": {"Name": "Sezgin E.", "AuthorID": "55154490500", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "6602075560": {"Name": "Eggeling C.", "AuthorID": "6602075560", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "56148369900": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "56148369900", "AffiliationID": "60013625, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "24554512000": {"Name": "Moeendarbary E.", "AuthorID": "24554512000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57208458979": {"Name": "Charras G.", "AuthorID": "57208458979", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6603712893": {"Name": "Betzig E.", "AuthorID": "6603712893", "AffiliationID": "60001224", "AffiliationName": "Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus"}}}
