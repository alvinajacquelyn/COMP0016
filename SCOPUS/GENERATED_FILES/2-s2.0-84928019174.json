Two large prospective studies (IDE [S-ICD System IDE Clinical Investigation] and EFFORTLESS [Boston Scientific Post Market S-ICD Registry]) have reported 6-month to 1-year data on the S-ICD. Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the S-ICD in a large diverse population. Methods Data from the IDE and EFFORTLESS studies were pooled. Shocks were independently adjudicated, and complications were measured with a standardized classification scheme. Enrollment date quartiles were used to assess event rates over time. Results Eight hundred eighty-two patients who underwent implantation were followed for 651 \u00b1 345 days. Spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF) events (n = 111) were treated in 59 patients; 100 (90.1%) events were terminated with 1 shock, and 109 events (98.2%) were terminated within the 5 available shocks. The estimated 3-year inappropriate shock rate was 13.1%. Estimated 3-year, all-cause mortality was 4.7% (95% confidence interval: 0.9% to 8.5%), with 26 deaths (2.9%). Device-related complications occurred in 11.1% of patients at 3 years. There were no electrode failures, and no S-ICD-related endocarditis or bacteremia occurred. Three devices (0.3%) were replaced for right ventricular pacing. The 6-month complication rate decreased by quartile of enrollment (Q1: 8.9%; Q4: 5.5%), and there was a trend toward a reduction in inappropriate shocks (Q1: 6.9% Q4: 4.5%). Conclusions The S-ICD demonstrated high efficacy for VT/VF. Complications and inappropriate shock rates were reduced consistently with strategic programming and as operator experience increased. These data provide further evidence for the safety and efficacy of the S-ICD.
