We present an analysis of trends in presentations in the nursing program at the SIOP congress from 2003 to 2012 based on all accepted abstracts. Procedure: A total of 462 abstracts were analyzed. A data extraction form was used to ensure consistency of data retrieved. Paired researchers were assigned 2 years of abstracts for assessment: approximately 80-100 abstracts each. Data were entered into REDCap data management software. Results: Most abstracts came from presenters affiliated with institutions in Europe and North America with a noticeably significant under-representation from developing countries. There was an equal representation of papers focused on empirical research with family members and clinical practice focused on the professional role, although this varied in some years. Analysis of research methodology revealed a predominance of surveys, with a recent increase in qualitative and mixed method studies. Out of all abstracts only 18% were subsequently published. Conclusions: Gaps have been identified, such as the limited involvement ofj nurses in developing countries, and lack of studies self-reporting from children. Much needs to be done to promote a greater diversity of research frameworks and more dynamic research designs. The small percentage of abstracts from nurses that are eventually published may hinder translation of the findings into clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nursing", "Published abstracts", "Review", "SIOP congress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Congresses as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nursing", "Nursing Care", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945298068", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"7101616129": {"Name": "Gibson F.", "AuthorID": "7101616129", "AffiliationID": "60031237, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Children and Young People's Cancer Care, Centre for Outcomes and Experiences Research in Children's Health, Illness, and Disability (ORCHID), Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and London South Bank University"}, "37075880600": {"Name": "Vindrola-Padros C.", "AuthorID": "37075880600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London (UCL)"}, "7103120962": {"Name": "Hinds P.", "AuthorID": "7103120962", "AffiliationID": "60005723", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing Research and Quality Outcomes, Children's National Medical Center"}, "8534967600": {"Name": "Nolbris M.J.", "AuthorID": "8534967600", "AffiliationID": "60008841", "AffiliationName": "Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Centrum for Children's Rights"}, "7403137588": {"Name": "Kelly D.", "AuthorID": "7403137588", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Research and Innovation/RCN Chair of Nursing Research, School of Healthcare Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "55468823100": {"Name": "Kelly P.", "AuthorID": "55468823100", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Nursing Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing, Midwifery Kings College London, Honorary Senior Research Associate Louis Dundas Centre, Children's Palliative Care University College London"}, "57189174523": {"Name": "Ruccione K.", "AuthorID": "57189174523", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}, "6506899099": {"Name": "Soanes L.", "AuthorID": "6506899099", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60112922", "AffiliationName": "Teenage Cancer Trust Nurse Consultant for Adolescents and Young Adults, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "18343093700": {"Name": "Woodgate R.L.", "AuthorID": "18343093700", "AffiliationID": "60009697, 60028706", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Institutes of Health Research Applied Chair in Reproductive, Child and Youth Health Services and Policy Research, Faculty of Health Sciences, College of Nursing, University of Manitoba"}, "6506488544": {"Name": "Baggott C.", "AuthorID": "6506488544", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Nurse Practitioner-Pediatric Oncology, Cancer Clinical Trials Office, Stanford University"}}}
