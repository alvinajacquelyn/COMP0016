Samples were incubated with Hoechst, calcein-AM and ethidium homodimer prior to mounting on a curved imaging chamber. Z-stacked fluorescence microscopy images were combined to produce an in-focus global image capable of resolving all cell nuclei. Image processing software was used to define a calcein-positive live cell area, count all cell nuclei within this area and subtract ethidium-positive dead cells to derive the total viable endothelial cell count. Corrected global cell density was calculated by dividing the number of viable cells by the graft area, which had been corrected for imaging a curved surface.RESULTS: Corrected global cell density was lower than the central endothelial cell density in both groups: 85.5% of the pre-preparation central endothelial cell density in the peel group and 75.8% in the bubble group. Corrected global cell density was significantly lower in the liquid bubble separation group than in the peel group (p=0.04).CONCLUSIONS: Eye bank estimations of central endothelial cell density overestimate true cell density after graft preparation in DMEK. A peel method is less damaging and more consistent than a liquid bubble method. Cell loss correlated strongly with the degree of stromal hydration prior to bubble separation in the liquid bubble group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cornea", "Eye (Tissue) Banking", "Treatment Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cell Count", "Cell Survival", "Corneal Endothelial Cell Loss", "Culture Media", "Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Eye Banks", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Tissue and Organ Harvesting", "Tissue Donors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028276442", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"24449255900": {"Name": "Bhogal M.", "AuthorID": "24449255900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7102506160": {"Name": "Allan B.", "AuthorID": "7102506160", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003313272": {"Name": "Balda M.", "AuthorID": "7003313272", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57196175685": {"Name": "Matter K.", "AuthorID": "57196175685", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell Biology, University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
