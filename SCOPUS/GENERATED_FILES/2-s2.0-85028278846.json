However, this finding varies significantly across development. Here we studied speeded responding to audio-visual targets, a key multisensory function whose development remains unclear. We found that when judging the locations of targets, children aged 4 to 12 years and adults had faster and less variable response times given auditory and visual information together compared with either alone. Comparison of response time distributions with model predictions indicated that children at all ages were integrating (pooling) sensory information to make decisions but that both the overall speed and the efficiency of sensory integration improved with age. The evidence for pooling comes from comparison with the predictions of Miller's seminal \u2018race model\u2019, as well as with a major recent extension of this model and a comparable \u2018pooling\u2019 (coactivation) model. The findings and analyses can reconcile results from previous audio-visual studies, in which infants showed speed gains exceeding race model predictions in a spatial orienting task (Neil et al., 2006) but children below 7 years did not in speeded reaction time tasks (e.g. Barutchu et al., 2009). Our results provide new evidence for early and sustained abilities to integrate visual and auditory signals for spatial localization from a young age.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028278846", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"8249732800": {"Name": "Nardini M.", "AuthorID": "8249732800", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57195461485": {"Name": "Bales J.", "AuthorID": "57195461485", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Visual Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7004069522": {"Name": "Mareschal D.", "AuthorID": "7004069522", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}}}
