KGaA, WeinheimHerein, a nanometric CuO anode for lithium-ion batteries was investigated by combining electrochemical measurements and ex situ X-ray computed tomography (CT) at the nanoscale. The electrode reacted by conversion at about 1.2 and 2.4 V versus Li+/Li during discharge and charge, respectively, to deliver a capacity ranging from 500 mAh g\u22121 to over 600 mAh g\u22121. Three-dimensional nano-CT imaging revealed substantial reorganization of the CuO particles and precipitation of a Li+-conducting film suitable for a possible application in the battery. A lithium-ion cell, exploiting the high capacity of the conversion process, was assembled by using a high-performance LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2 cathode reacting at 3.9 V versus Li+/Li. The cell was proposed as an energy-storage system with an average working voltage of about 2.5 V, specific capacity of 170 mAh gcathode\u22121, and efficiency exceeding 99 % with a very stable cycling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anode", "CuO", "Li-ion battery", "LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2", "X-ray computed tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conversion process", "Electrochemical conversion", "Electrochemical measurements", "Energy storage systems", "LiNi0.33Co0.33Mn0.33O2", "Specific capacities", "Substantial reorganization", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069910094", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"56416532600": {"Name": "Di Lecce D.", "AuthorID": "56416532600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56901064000": {"Name": "Iacoviello F.", "AuthorID": "56901064000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57220340962": {"Name": "Levchenko S.", "AuthorID": "57220340962", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Ferrara"}, "7102421480": {"Name": "Hassoun J.", "AuthorID": "7102421480", "AffiliationID": "60024690", "AffiliationName": "National Interuniversity Consortium of Materials Science and Technology (INSTM), University of Ferrara Research Unit, University of Ferrara"}}}
