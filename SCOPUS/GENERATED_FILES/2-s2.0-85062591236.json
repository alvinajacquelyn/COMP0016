Certain migrants may be at increased risk of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and have poorer outcomes. Early diagnosis and management of these infections can reduce morbidity, mortality and onward transmission and is supported by national guidelines. To date, screening initiatives have been sporadic and focused on individual diseases; systematic routine testing of migrant groups for multiple infections is rarely undertaken and its impact is unknown. We describe the protocol for the evaluation of acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an integrated approach to screening migrants for a range of infectious diseases in primary care. Methods and analysis We will conduct a mixed-methods study which includes an observational cohort with interrupted time-series analysis before and after the introduction of routine screening of migrants for infectious diseases (latent TB, HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C) when first registering with primary care within Leicester, UK. We will assess trends in the monthly number and rate of testing and diagnosis for latent TB, HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C to determine the effect of the policy change using segmented regression analyses at monthly time-points. Concurrently, we will undertake an integrated qualitative sub-study to understand the views of migrants and healthcare professionals to the new testing policy in primary care. Finally, we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combined infection testing for migrants in primary care. Ethics and dissemination The study has received HRA and NHS approvals for both the interrupted time-series analysis (16/SC/0127) and the qualitative sub-study (16/EM/0159). For the interrupted time-series analysis we will only use fully anonymised data. For the qualitative sub-study, we will gain written, informed, consent. Dissemination of the results will be through local and national meetings/conferences as well as publications in peer-reviewed journals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["blood-borne virus", "latent tuberculosis", "migrant", "screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communicable Disease Control", "Communicable Diseases", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Interrupted Time Series Analysis", "Mass Screening", "Primary Health Care", "Qualitative Research", "Transients and Migrants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062591236", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"54936473500": {"Name": "Pareek M.", "AuthorID": "54936473500", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and HIV Medicine, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "55936878000": {"Name": "Wobi F.", "AuthorID": "55936878000", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "16241387400": {"Name": "Haldar P.", "AuthorID": "16241387400", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "57207570696": {"Name": "Ellis K.S.", "AuthorID": "57207570696", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and HIV Medicine, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "7004203038": {"Name": "Stephenson I.", "AuthorID": "7004203038", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and HIV Medicine, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "21739088500": {"Name": "Eborall H.C.", "AuthorID": "21739088500", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "14050735100": {"Name": "Kontopantelis E.", "AuthorID": "14050735100", "AffiliationID": "60175817", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Primary Care, NIHR School for Primary Care Research"}, "55487100600": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "55487100600", "AffiliationID": "60016655", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Medicine, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care"}, "57210077827": {"Name": "Baggaley R.", "AuthorID": "57210077827", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Development, Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57202501909": {"Name": "Hollingsworth T.D.", "AuthorID": "57202501909", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Big Data Institute, University of Oxford"}, "7004694760": {"Name": "Baines D.", "AuthorID": "7004694760", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Accounting, Finance and Economics, Bournemouth University"}, "8727963500": {"Name": "Patel H.", "AuthorID": "8727963500", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Microbiology, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "57207567209": {"Name": "Patel M.", "AuthorID": "57207567209", "AffiliationID": "114808316", "AffiliationName": "NHS Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group"}, "57207566114": {"Name": "Kapur R.", "AuthorID": "57207566114", "AffiliationID": "114808316", "AffiliationName": "NHS Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group"}, "7005717051": {"Name": "Farooqi A.", "AuthorID": "7005717051", "AffiliationID": "114808316", "AffiliationName": "NHS Leicester City Clinical Commissioning Group"}, "56081421100": {"Name": "Browne I.", "AuthorID": "56081421100", "AffiliationID": "60110961", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Leicester City Council"}, "7202766660": {"Name": "Gill P.", "AuthorID": "7202766660", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Primary Care, University of Warwick"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Global Health, University College London"}, "55228809500": {"Name": "Griffiths C.", "AuthorID": "55228809500", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts Institute of Population Health Sciences Barts, London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}}}
