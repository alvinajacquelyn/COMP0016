External quantum efficiency measurements demonstrate twofold enhancement of the QD photocurrent in the ELO QD cell compared to the wafer-based QD cell. In the GaAs wavelength range, the ELO QD cell perfectly preserves the current collection efficiency of the baseline single-junction ELO cell. We demonstrate by full-wave optical simulations that integrating a micro-patterned diffraction grating in the ELO cell rearside provides more than tenfold enhancement of the near-infrared light harvesting by QDs. Experimental results are thoroughly discussed with the help of physics-based simulations to single out the impact of QD dynamics and defects on the cell photovoltaic behavior. It is demonstrated that non radiative recombination in the QD stack is the bottleneck for the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the reported devices. More important, our theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Voc offset of 0.3 V from the QD ground state identified by Tanabe et al., 2012, from a collection of experimental data of high quality III-V QD solar cells is a reliable \u2013 albeit conservative \u2013 metric to gauge the attainable Voc and to quantify the scope for improvement by reducing non radiative recombination. Provided that material quality issues are solved, we demonstrate \u2013 by transport and rigorous electromagnetic simulations \u2013 that light-trapping enhanced thin-film cells with twenty InAs/GaAs QD layers reach efficiency higher than 28% under unconcentrated light, ambient temperature. If photon recycling can be fully exploited, 30% efficiency is deemed to be feasible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epitaxial lift-off", "Light-trapping", "Quantum dot", "Solar cell", "Thin-film"], "IndexKeywords": ["Epitaxial liftoff", "External quantum efficiency", "Light-trapping", "Near infrared light", "Non-radiative recombinations", "Physics-based Simulation", "Quantum dot solar cells", "Theoretical calculations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039853836", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"6602655226": {"Name": "Cappelluti F.", "AuthorID": "6602655226", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Telecommunications"}, "36614099300": {"Name": "C\u00e9dola A.P.", "AuthorID": "36614099300", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Telecommunications"}, "57197834594": {"Name": "Elsehrawy F.", "AuthorID": "57197834594", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Telecommunications"}, "56555578900": {"Name": "Kim D.", "AuthorID": "56555578900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194075016": {"Name": "van Eerden M.", "AuthorID": "57194075016", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "7102374398": {"Name": "Mulder P.", "AuthorID": "7102374398", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "6701638101": {"Name": "Bauhuis G.", "AuthorID": "6701638101", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "7004314776": {"Name": "Schermer J.", "AuthorID": "7004314776", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "54930168300": {"Name": "Aho T.", "AuthorID": "54930168300", "AffiliationID": "60009565", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, Photonics Laboratory, Tampere University of Technology"}, "7006581046": {"Name": "Niemi T.", "AuthorID": "7006581046", "AffiliationID": "60009565", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, Photonics Laboratory, Tampere University of Technology"}, "35602016200": {"Name": "Guina M.", "AuthorID": "35602016200", "AffiliationID": "60009565", "AffiliationName": "Optoelectronics Research Centre, Photonics Laboratory, Tampere University of Technology"}, "36704445100": {"Name": "Bissels G.", "AuthorID": "36704445100", "AffiliationID": "120544964", "AffiliationName": "tf2 devices B.V."}}}
