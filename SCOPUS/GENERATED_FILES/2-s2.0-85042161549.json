Well-defined, sub-100 nm hybrid NPs were successfully formulated and their photothermal conversion efficiency was evaluated, which was found to be as high as 63% in the red-visible spectrum. By varying the GNP and GEM-polymer feed, it was possible to control the red-shifting of the surface plasmon resonance at therapeutically relevant wavelengths. The hybrid NPs exhibited significant cytotoxicity against MiaPaCa-2 cells with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.0012 mg mL-1; however the IC50 decreased by a factor of 2 after the cells were irradiated with a continuous wave red laser for 1 min (1.4 W cm-2). Although the irradiation of the aggregated GNPs loaded in the hybrid NPs produced a higher thermal effect for the same amount of non-loaded GNPs, the IC50 of the hybrid NPs was significantly lower than that of the free GNPs, hence indicating a synergistic effect of the polymer bound GEM and the GNPs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Gold nanoparticles (GNPs)", "Hybrid nanoparticle", "Inhibitory concentration", "Pancreatic cancers", "Photochemotherapy", "Photothermal conversion efficiencies", "Synergistic effect", "Therapeutic activity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042161549", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57194234653": {"Name": "Joubert F.", "AuthorID": "57194234653", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "21743908000": {"Name": "Pasparakis G.", "AuthorID": "21743908000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
