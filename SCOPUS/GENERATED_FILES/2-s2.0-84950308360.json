The ASSERTIVE study previously reported more sustained control of Br-SBP with aliskiren versus telmisartan in patients with hypertension, following 7-days treatment withdrawal. In this ASSERTIVE sub-study, we hypothesised that aliskiren would similarly exert more sustained control of CASP than telmisartan during treatment withdrawal. Methods: We investigated the effects of treatment withdrawal on both Br-SBP and CASP following 12-weeks treatment with either aliskiren (300 mg) or telmisartan (80 mg). Br-SBP and CASP were measured at the end of treatment, and at days 2 and 7 following treatment withdrawal in 303 patients (CASP randomised set). Results: Of the CASP randomised set, 94 patients completed CASP measurements at all time points (CASP completer set). After 7 days of treatment withdrawal, aliskiren demonstrated lesser increases in both Br-SBP and CASP than telmisartan; Br-SBP change: -2.0\u00b11.6 vs. +5.6\u00b11.7 mmHg, p = 0.001; CASP change: -0.4\u00b11.6 vs. +4.6\u00b11.7 mmHg, p = 0.041, n = 94. Similar findings were obtained for the CASP randomised set. Conclusions: Following treatment withdrawal, aliskiren demonstrated more sustained control of both brachial and central SBP than telmisartan.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aliskiren", "angiotensin receptor blockade", "central aortic pressure", "direct renin inhibition", "telmisartan", "treatment withdrawal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aldosterone", "Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists", "Aorta", "Arterial Pressure", "Blood Pressure", "Brachial Artery", "Demography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Renin", "Treatment Outcome", "Withholding Treatment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950308360", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"7102763287": {"Name": "Lacy P.S.", "AuthorID": "7102763287", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London Hospitals, University College London"}, "57217664918": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57217664918", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London Hospitals, University College London"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London Hospitals, University College London"}, "7006007656": {"Name": "Brunel P.", "AuthorID": "7006007656", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "7102726114": {"Name": "Bader G.", "AuthorID": "7102726114", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "6507629000": {"Name": "Baschiera F.", "AuthorID": "6507629000", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma AG"}, "7005047603": {"Name": "D\u00fcsing R.", "AuthorID": "7005047603", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Hypertoniezentrum Bonn"}}}
