This study provides current UK data on awareness of the link between obesity and cancer by socio-demographic factors, including BMI, and explores to what degree healthcare professionals provide weight management advice to patients. Methods Cross-sectional survey of 3293 adults completed an online survey in February/March 2016, weighted to be representative of the UK population aged 18+. Results Public awareness of the link between obesity and cancer is low (25.4% unprompted and 57.5% prompted). Higher levels of awareness existed for least deprived groups (P < 0.001), compared to more deprived groups. Most respondents had seen a healthcare practitioner in the past 12 months (91.6%) and 17.4% had received advice about their weight, although 48.4% of the sample were overweight/obese. Conclusion Cancer is not at the forefront of people's minds when considering health conditions associated with overweight or obesity. Socioeconomic disparities exist in health knowledge across the UK population, with adults from more affluent groups being most aware. Healthcare professionals are uniquely positioned to provide advice about weight, but opportunities for intervention are currently under-utilized in healthcare settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Obesity", "Socio-economic factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Directive Counseling", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Risk Factors", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059236343", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57192171562": {"Name": "Hooper L.", "AuthorID": "57192171562", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Policy Research Centre for Cancer Prevention (PRCP), Cancer Research UK, Angel Building"}, "57220708441": {"Name": "Birch J.", "AuthorID": "57220708441", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Policy Research Centre for Cancer Prevention (PRCP), Cancer Research UK, Angel Building"}, "57204017749": {"Name": "Rosenberg G.", "AuthorID": "57204017749", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Policy Research Centre for Cancer Prevention (PRCP), Cancer Research UK, Angel Building"}, "57055368200": {"Name": "Vohra J.", "AuthorID": "57055368200", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Policy Research Centre for Cancer Prevention (PRCP), Cancer Research UK, Angel Building"}, "57182480800": {"Name": "Anderson A.S.", "AuthorID": "57182480800", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research into Cancer Prevention and Screening, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee"}, "16300728600": {"Name": "Forster A.S.", "AuthorID": "16300728600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "55888724100": {"Name": "Bauld L.", "AuthorID": "55888724100", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "University of Stirling"}}}
