Using Guangzhou survey data and multilevel linear regressions, this paper examines the extent to and ways in which migrants' social ties with neighbours enhance their SWB, with a particular focus on the distinction between the main effects and buffering effects of their neighbourhood ties. Results from multilevel models reveal that neighbourhood ties enhance migrants' SWB in a direct manner, but no evidence shows that neighbourhood ties lessen the negative impacts of neighbourhood deprivation. Results also illustrate that the association between neighbourhood ties and SWB is stronger for locals than for migrants. This paper contributes to our understanding of migrants' SWB by disentangling the positive effects of their social ties with neighbours and investigating the role of migrants' neighbourhood ties in relation to stress arising from neighbourhood deprivation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "Migrants", "Neighbourhood deprivation", "Neighbourhood ties", "Subjective wellbeing", "Urban neighbourhoods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020055674", "SubjectAreas": [["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"56946494800": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56946494800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "25634980900": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "25634980900", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "7403463877": {"Name": "Wu F.", "AuthorID": "7403463877", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "49964095100": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "49964095100", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban and Regional Planning, School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55707215900": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "55707215900", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Urban Design, Wuhan University"}}}
