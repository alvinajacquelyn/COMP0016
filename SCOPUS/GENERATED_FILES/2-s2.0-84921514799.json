The UK has some of the most advanced STI surveillance systems globally. This article uses national surveillance data to describe remarkable changes in STI epidemiology in the UK over the last century and explores the behavioral and demographic shifts that may explain these trends. The past 10 years have seen considerable improvements in STI service provision and the introduction of national public health interventions. However, sexual health inequalities persist and men who have sex with men, young adults and black ethnic minorities remain a priority for interventions. Technological advances in testing and a shift in sexual health service commissioning arrangements will present both opportunities and challenges in future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "sexual behavior", "sexual health interventions", "sexual health services", "sexually transmitted infections", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Demography", "Female", "Gonorrhea", "Great Britain", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Male", "Public Health Practice", "Risk Factors", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexually Transmitted Diseases", "Syphilis", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921514799", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and STIs, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, Mortimer Market Centre"}}}
