Nearly 25% of the doctors working in the NHS are IMGs who obtained their primary medical degree from outside the EU. Moving to a different country that holds a different set of values and belief systems can be very challenging for IMGs, which in turn could have a significant effect on the service provided to NHS patients. This article will address the issue of effective communication skills within the IMG population and will explore the underlying issues behind this problem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["International medical graduates", "national health service", "patient-centered care", "the professional and linguistic assessments board exam"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Competence", "Communication", "Culture", "Educational Measurement", "Foreign Medical Graduates", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Language", "Patient-Centered Care", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953345010", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56916019200": {"Name": "Hamarneh A.", "AuthorID": "56916019200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "a The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}}}
