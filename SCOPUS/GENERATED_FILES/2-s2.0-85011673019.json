We examined baseline data from 3,987 subjects without diabetes in the Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis (PESA) Study. For the second, third, and fourth ox-LDL quartiles versus the first, the odds ratios (95% CI) for MS were 0.84 (0.52, 1.36), 1.47 (0.95, 2.32), and 2.57 (1.66, 4.04) (P < 0.001 for trend) once adjusted for age, sex, smoking, LDL-cholesterol, BMI, waist circumference, and HOMA-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Results showing the same trend were found for all MS components except glucose concentration. Ox-LDL mediated 13.9% of the association of waist circumference with triglycerides and only 1-3% of the association with HDL-cholesterol, blood pressure, and insulin concentration. HOMA-IR did not mediate the association between ox-LDL and MS components. This study found higher ox-LDL concentrations were associated with MS and its components independently of central obesity and insulin resistance. Ox-LDL may reflect core mechanisms through which MS components develop and progress in parallel with insulin resistance and could be a clinically relevant predictor of MS development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Glucose", "Blood Pressure", "Body Mass Index", "Cholesterol, HDL", "Cholesterol, LDL", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Lipoproteins, LDL", "Male", "Metabolic Syndrome", "Middle Aged", "Obesity, Abdominal", "Odds Ratio", "Oxidative Stress", "Smoking", "Triglycerides", "Waist Circumference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011673019", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"55330500700": {"Name": "Hurtado-Roca Y.", "AuthorID": "55330500700", "AffiliationID": "115748303", "AffiliationName": "Boca Raton Clinical Research Global Peru"}, "57218323754": {"Name": "Bueno H.", "AuthorID": "57218323754", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Hospital 12 de Octubre"}, "56517073500": {"Name": "Fernandez-Ortiz A.", "AuthorID": "56517073500", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Cl\u00ednico San Carlos, Universidad Complutense"}, "56761010400": {"Name": "Ordovas J.M.", "AuthorID": "56761010400", "AffiliationID": "60103639, 60023143", "AffiliationName": "U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University"}, "13907649300": {"Name": "Iba\u00f1ez B.", "AuthorID": "13907649300", "AffiliationID": "60026796, 60019290", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n-Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz Hospital, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "7202675508": {"Name": "Fuster V.", "AuthorID": "7202675508", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "10046356900": {"Name": "Laclaustra M.", "AuthorID": "10046356900", "AffiliationID": "60028590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, St. Louis University"}, "7005228364": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Artalejo F.", "AuthorID": "7005228364", "AffiliationID": "60106529", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Epidemiologia y Salud Publica, Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, School of Medicine, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid/Idipaz"}}}
