Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.Background: Permanent childhood hearing loss (PCHL) is associated with an elevated level of emotional and behaviour difficulties (EBD). In children and adolescents with PCHL, EBD has been found to be linked to language ability in children with PCHL. The present study was designed to test whether childhood language and/or reading comprehension abilities of children with PCHL predict subsequent EBD in adolescence. Methods: Language comprehension (LC) and reading comprehension (RC) were measured at ages 6\u201310 years (Time 1) and 13\u201320 years (Time 2) in participants with PCHL who preferred to communicate using spoken language (n = 57) and a hearing comparison group (n = 38). EBD was measured at both time points by parent and by teacher ratings on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results: Within the PCHL group there were negative correlations between EBD scores and concurrent LC and RC scores at Time 1 and at Time 2. Cross-lagged latent variable models fitted to the longitudinal data indicated that the associations between LC, RC and teacher-rated EBD were more likely to arise from the impact of LC and RC on behaviour rather than the other way around. Conclusions: In those with PCHL, poor language and reading comprehension in middle childhood increased the risk of emotional and behaviour difficulties at school in the teenage years. The results suggest that effective language and literacy interventions for children with hearing loss may also bring benefits to their mental health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deaf", "emotional and behaviour difficulties", "language comprehension", "Permanent childhood hearing loss", "reading comprehension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Development", "Adult", "Affective Symptoms", "Behavioral Symptoms", "Child", "Child Development", "Comprehension", "Female", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Language", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Reading", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028827933", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7402960884": {"Name": "Stevenson J.", "AuthorID": "7402960884", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "6603447167": {"Name": "Kreppner J.", "AuthorID": "6603447167", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Social and Human Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "26650178200": {"Name": "Pimperton H.", "AuthorID": "26650178200", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "13605005100": {"Name": "Worsfold S.", "AuthorID": "13605005100", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "55749016900": {"Name": "Kennedy C.", "AuthorID": "55749016900", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "36683224500": {"Name": "Terlektsi E.", "AuthorID": "36683224500", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Birmingham"}, "8726278400": {"Name": "Mahon M.", "AuthorID": "8726278400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language and Cognition Research Department, University College London"}}}
