In conventional m-CAP systems, the total signal bandwidth is divided into m equally distributed subcarriers. In this work, for the first time, we set the subcarrier bandwidths such that the first subcarrier is the same as the LED bandwidth, and subsequently distribute the remaining bandwidth equally between m - 1 subcarriers. We show that using m = 4, 6, 8 and 10 subcarriers and 16-QAM, the first subcarrier is able to achieve a bit error rate (BER) target of 10-4 (i.e., which is below the 7% forward error correction (FEC) BER limits of 3.8 \u00d7 10-3)at Eb/N0 = 15.5 dB. This is a power penalty of -1.5 dB to achieve the same average performance as the first five, four and three subcarriers of the conventional 10, 8 and 6-CAP and a power penalty of \u223c1 dB for new 4-CAP to achieve the average performance of the first two subcarriers of the conventional 4-CAP. Consequently, using the proposed m-CAP concept we show a reduction in the complexity by reducing the number of finite impulse response (FIR) filters by 80%, 75%, -67% and 50% in contrast to the conventional 10, 8, 6, and 4-CAP, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["band limited VLC system", "Multi-band carrier-less amplitude and phase modulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amplitude and phase modulations", "band limited VLC system", "Carrier-less", "Optical wireless communication systems", "Power penalty", "Remaining bandwidth", "Signal bandwidth", "Subcarrier bandwidth"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991575726", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"56800923400": {"Name": "Werfli K.", "AuthorID": "56800923400", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, NCRLab, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, NCRLab, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "57191586669": {"Name": "Hassan N.", "AuthorID": "57191586669", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, NCRLab, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}}}
