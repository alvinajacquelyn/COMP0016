Methods: We assessed the association of lifelong occupation and educational level with C-IMT in the IMPROVE study cohort including 3703 subjects (median age 64.4 years; 48% men) from Southern (Italy), Western (France and the Netherlands) and Northern Europe (Finland and Sweden). Three summary measures of C-IMT (IMTmean, IMTmax, IMTmean-max), obtained from four segments of both carotids, were considered. Results: After adjusting for conventional CV risk factors, current employment status and diet, C-IMT was higher in manual workers than in white collars (+7.7%, +5.3%, +4.6% for IMTmax, IMTmean-max and IMTmean, respectively; all p<.0001). Similar results were obtained by stratification for educational level. The effect of occupation on C-IMT was comparable in men and women and in different age groups, and was only partially mediated by differences in CV risk factors. Of note, the association of C-IMT with occupation was significant in Western and Northern Europe but not in Italy, with a significant statistical interaction (p =.0005). Conclusions: Low SES was associated with subclinical atherosclerosis in subjects with at least three CV risk factors. Such association was stronger in Northern and Western Europe than in Italy. This difference was not completely explained by inequalities in CV risk factors and behavioural variables.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atherosclerosis", "European countries", "Geographical variations", "Socioeconomic status", "Vascular risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Asymptomatic Diseases", "Carotid Artery Diseases", "Carotid Intima-Media Thickness", "Diet", "Educational Status", "Europe", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occupations", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Social Determinants of Health"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042946105", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"25222107400": {"Name": "Tedesco C.C.", "AuthorID": "25222107400", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "21136513100": {"Name": "Veglia F.", "AuthorID": "21136513100", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "7103061528": {"Name": "Amato M.", "AuthorID": "7103061528", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "56452656400": {"Name": "Bonomi A.", "AuthorID": "56452656400", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "22235372100": {"Name": "Ravani A.", "AuthorID": "22235372100", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "23485126900": {"Name": "Frigerio B.", "AuthorID": "23485126900", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "44061868800": {"Name": "Sansaro D.", "AuthorID": "44061868800", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "7006057885": {"Name": "Tremoli E.", "AuthorID": "7006057885", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche e Biomolecolari, Universit\u00e0 di Milano"}, "6701322321": {"Name": "Baldassarre D.", "AuthorID": "6701322321", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine, Universit\u00e0 di Milano"}, "7103145439": {"Name": "de Faire U.", "AuthorID": "7103145439", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "13605651400": {"Name": "Kurl S.", "AuthorID": "13605651400", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio Campus"}, "7103114601": {"Name": "Smit A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103114601", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen"}, "7006315020": {"Name": "Rauramaa R.", "AuthorID": "7006315020", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Research in Health Exercise and Nutrition, Kuopio Research Institute of Exercise Medicine"}, "7006482932": {"Name": "Giral P.", "AuthorID": "7006482932", "AffiliationID": "60021567, 60015622", "AffiliationName": "Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Service Endocrinologie-Metabolisme, Groupe H\u00f4pitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Unit\u00e9s de Pr\u00e9vention Cardiovasculaire"}, "6505944294": {"Name": "Castelnuovo S.", "AuthorID": "6505944294", "AffiliationID": "60015852", "AffiliationName": "Centro Dislipidemie E.
