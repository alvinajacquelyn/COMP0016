Their consequences in extreme conditions and accidents are highly nonlinear in association with multiple physical processes, multiple scales, and multiple criteria. To accurately identify nonlinear structural consequences, multidisciplinary approaches should be applied in conjuction with advanced computational models and large-scale physical model testing. This chapter presents methods and facilities for the large-scale physical model testing of structures and infrastructures in extreme and accidental conditions and for testing at the material level.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070701367", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
