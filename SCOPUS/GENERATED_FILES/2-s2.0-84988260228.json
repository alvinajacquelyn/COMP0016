In an attempt to fabricate superior nanocomposites from silk fibroin, textile braided structures made of natively spun fibres of Bombyx mori silkworm were compared against regenerated fibroin (lyophilized and films) underpinning the influence of intrinsic properties of fibroin matrices on HA nucleation. We found that native braids could bind Ca2 + ions through electrostatic attraction, which initiated the nucleation and deposition of HA, as evidenced by discrete shift in amide peaks via ATR-FTIR. This phenomenon also suggests the involvement of amide linkages in promoting HA nucleation on fibroin. Moreover, CaCl2-SBF immersion of native braids resulted in preferential growth of HA along the c-axis, forming needle-like nanocrystals and possessing Ca/P ratio comparable to commercial HA. Though regenerated lyophilized matrix also witnessed prominent peak shift in amide linkages, HA growth was restricted to (211) plane only, albeit at a significantly lower intensity than braids. Regenerated films, on the other hand, provided no crystallographic evidence of HA deposition within 7 days of SBF immersion. The present work sheds light on the primary fibroin structure of B. mori which probably plays a crucial role in regulating template-induced biomineralisation on the matrix. We also found that intrinsic material properties such as surface roughness, geometry, specific surface area, tortuosity and secondary conformation exert influence in modulating the extent of mineralisation. Thus our work generates useful insights and warrants future studies to further investigate the potential of bone mimetic, silk/mineral nanocomposite matrices for orthopaedic applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hydroxyapatite", "Mineralisation", "Silk fibroin", "Simulated body fluid", "Textile braid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bombyx mori silkworm", "Electrostatic attractions", "Mineralisation", "Orthopaedic applications", "Preferential growth", "Secondary conformation", "Silk fibroin", "Simulated body fluids", "Animals", "Biomimetic Materials", "Bombyx", "Fibroins", "Membranes, Artificial", "Nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988260228", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55779339700": {"Name": "Midha S.", "AuthorID": "55779339700", "AffiliationID": "60032730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Textile Technology, Indian Institute of Technology"}, "56999810500": {"Name": "Tripathi R.", "AuthorID": "56999810500", "AffiliationID": "60032730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Textile Technology, Indian Institute of Technology"}, "55478989200": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "55478989200", "AffiliationID": "60032730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Textile Technology, Indian Institute of Technology"}, "57189219743": {"Name": "Geng H.", "AuthorID": "57189219743", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}}}
