No published studies have validated its use in the native knee and the post-unicompartmental replacement knee (UKR). We quantified the difference in measurements obtained from CTS and LLR for knee alignment. Patients and methods-Supine CT scanograms and weight bearing long leg plain anteroposterior radiographs were obtained for 40 knees (in 25 patients), 17 of which were native, and 23 of which were post-UKR. The mechanical and anatomical axes of the tibio-femoral joint were measured. Bland-Altman plots were used to calculate the 1.96 standard deviation limits of agreement between CTS and LLR. Intraclass correlation was used to assess intra-rater and inter-rater reliability (where values > 0.81 indicate very good reliability). Results-CTS and LLR were equally reliable in measurement of the mechanical and anatomical axes of the tibio-femoral joint (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) > 0.9 for all parameters). Statistically significant and clinically relevant differences were found between CTS and LLR in measurement of the mechanical axis (limits of agreement: UKR -3.2\u00b0 to 6.3\u00b0; native -3.2\u00b0 to 5.6\u00b0) and the anatomical axis (limits of agreement: UKR -3.7\u00b0 to 8.7\u00b0; native -2.0\u00b0 to 8.8\u00b0). Interpretation-Although it is a reliable tool, CTS is not necessarily an accurate one for measurement of knee alignment when compared to LLR. We recommend that CTS should not be used as a substitute for LLR in measurement of the mechanical or anatomical axes of the knee.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Bone Malalignment", "Femur", "Humans", "Knee Joint", "Observer Variation", "Postoperative Period", "Radiography", "Reproducibility of Results", "Supine Position", "Tibia", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Weight-Bearing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937889127", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"55371622600": {"Name": "Holme T.", "AuthorID": "55371622600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London"}, "56735997600": {"Name": "Hartshorn K.", "AuthorID": "56735997600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London"}, "7202728836": {"Name": "Cobb J.", "AuthorID": "7202728836", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Imperial College London"}}}
