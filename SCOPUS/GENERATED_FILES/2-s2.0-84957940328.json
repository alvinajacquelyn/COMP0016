Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, records of patients with diagnosis of bilateral posterior scleritis at two tertiary-care centers in the UK and India were analyzed in comparison with the clinical profile of patients with unilateral scleritis. Results: In total, 18 patients with bilateral posterior scleritis were identified and compared with 96 patients of unilateral posterior scleritis; 14 (77%) were women and the median age was 48 years. Headache (p = 0.04), optic nerve swelling (p = 0.01), and elevated antinuclear antibodies (ANA) titers (p = 0.03) were present more frequently in patients with bilateral than in unilateral posterior scleritis. Seven patients (38.88%) required immunosuppressive therapy to attain resolution of the inflammation and to prevent relapse. Conclusions: Bilateral posterior scleritis is an uncommon but severe inflammation of the posterior sclera. The majority of them are idiopathic, often requiring aggressive treatment to prevent visual loss.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ANA", "bilateral posterior scleritis", "immunosuppressive therapy", "posterior scleritis", "systemic association"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antibodies, Antinuclear", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Headache", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Papilledema", "Posterior Eye Segment", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Scleritis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957940328", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36619001900": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pez J.J.", "AuthorID": "36619001900", "AffiliationID": "60027800", "AffiliationName": "Surgery Department, Universidad de Alcal\u00e1 School of Medicine"}, "36992191500": {"Name": "Lavric A.", "AuthorID": "36992191500", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7201475180": {"Name": "Agrawal R.", "AuthorID": "7201475180", "AffiliationID": "60002481, 60095080", "AffiliationName": "National Healthcare Group Eye Institute, Tan Tock Seng Hospital"}, "56922253900": {"Name": "Dutta Majumder P.", "AuthorID": "56922253900", "AffiliationID": "60026060", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Foundation"}, "56684352900": {"Name": "Bansal N.", "AuthorID": "56684352900", "AffiliationID": "60026060", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Foundation"}, "7102648244": {"Name": "Biswas J.", "AuthorID": "7102648244", "AffiliationID": "60026060", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Foundation"}}}
