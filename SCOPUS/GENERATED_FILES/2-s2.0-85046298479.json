This article aims to demonstrate the limits of unstructured scripting approaches, and advocates the development of more systematic techniques. For this, we examined he differences and similarities between various scripts. Twenty-one participants were trained in crime scripting, and tasked to produce individual scripts based on the same video footage of a shop robbery. Content analysis was applied to the scripts, which involved classifying the different steps of the crime commission process and analyzing their distributions. A scoring system was then developed to assess the relative degree of completeness of each script, and linear regression computed using the number of activities included as the predictor variable. This research provides the first evidence of the limits of creating scripts using an intuitive approach, and the need for applying semi-structured goal-based methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crime script", "Modus operandi", "Robbery", "Situational crime prevention", "Video"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comparative analysis", "Content analysis", "Crime Prevention", "Modus operandi", "Predictor variables", "Relative degrees", "Robbery", "Video"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046298479", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"22233563100": {"Name": "Borrion H.", "AuthorID": "22233563100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "57188839935": {"Name": "Dehghanniri H.", "AuthorID": "57188839935", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "57201864282": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57201864282", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
