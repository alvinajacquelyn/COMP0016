This can be shown marginalizing the joint distribution of individual energies, which is a symmetric Dirichlet distribution. In the thermodynamic limit the beta distributions converge to gamma distributions with different arguments and shape or scale parameters, corresponding respectively to the Gaussian, i.e., Maxwell-Boltzmann, Maxwell, and Boltzmann or Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. These analytical results agree with molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations with different numbers of hard disks or spheres and hard reflecting walls or periodic boundary conditions. The agreement is perfect with our Monte Carlo algorithm, which acts only on velocities independently of positions with the collision versor sampled uniformly on a unit half sphere in d dimensions, while slight deviations appear with our molecular dynamics simulations for the smallest values of N.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution", "Dirichlet distributions", "Energy distributions", "Microcanonical ensembles", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Molecular-dynamics ensemble", "Monte carlo algorithms", "Periodic boundary conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940837697", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7003664476": {"Name": "Scalas E.", "AuthorID": "7003664476", "AffiliationID": "60104711", "AffiliationName": "Basque Center for Applied Mathematics"}, "25931364600": {"Name": "Gabriel A.T.", "AuthorID": "25931364600", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, WZMW, Philipps-University Marburg"}, "57213579983": {"Name": "Martin E.", "AuthorID": "57213579983", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, WZMW, Philipps-University Marburg"}, "7102798637": {"Name": "Germano G.", "AuthorID": "7102798637", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Science"}}}
