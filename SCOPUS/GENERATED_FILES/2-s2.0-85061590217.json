NCMD is a nonprogressive developmental macular dystrophy, in which variants upstream of PRDM13 have been implicated. Whole genome sequencing was performed to interrogate structural variants (SVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in eight individuals, six affected individuals from two families with PBCRA, and two individuals from an additional family with a related developmental macular dystrophy. A SNV (chr6:100,046,804T>C), located 7.8 kb upstream of the PRDM13 gene, was shared by all PBCRA-affected individuals in the disease locus. Haplotype analysis suggested that the variant arose independently in the two families. The two affected individuals from Family 3 were screened for rare variants in the PBCRA and NCMD loci. This revealed a de novo variant in the proband, 21 bp from the first SNV (chr6:100,046,783A>C). This study expands the noncoding variant spectrum upstream of PRDM13 and suggests altered spatio-temporal expression of PRDM13 as a candidate disease mechanism in the phenotypically distinct but related conditions, NCMD and PBCRA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["macular development", "macular dystrophy", "NCMD", "PBCRA", "PRDM13", "whole genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["5' Untranslated Regions", "Adult", "Computational Biology", "Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Loci", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Haplotypes", "Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase", "Humans", "Multigene Family", "Pedigree", "Retinal Dystrophies", "Transcription Factors", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061590217", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57191898182": {"Name": "Silva R.S.", "AuthorID": "57191898182", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6508145987": {"Name": "Arno G.", "AuthorID": "6508145987", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "23007919800": {"Name": "Cipriani V.", "AuthorID": "23007919800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Genetics Institute, Evolution and Environment"}, "37665820900": {"Name": "Pontikos N.", "AuthorID": "37665820900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Genetics Institute, Evolution and Environment"}, "7006570141": {"Name": "van Heyningen V.", "AuthorID": "7006570141", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60031970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, UCSF School of Medicine"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "26221216300": {"Name": "Kalhoro A.", "AuthorID": "26221216300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6602476666": {"Name": "Defoort-Dhellemmes S.", "AuthorID": "6602476666", "AffiliationID": "60017724", "AffiliationName": "Exploration de la Vision et Neuro-Ophtalmologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire"}, "7003411528": {"Name": "Puech B.", "AuthorID": "7003411528", "AffiliationID": "60017724", "AffiliationName": "Exploration de la Vision et Neuro-Ophtalmologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire"}, "36520865300": {"Name": "Carss K.J.", "AuthorID": "36520865300", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "NIHR BioResource-Rare Diseases, Cambridge University Hospitals, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "57216044821": {"Name": "Raymond F.L.", "AuthorID": "57216044821", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge"}, "8681684200": {"Name": "Dhaenens C.M.", "AuthorID": "8681684200", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60107834", "AffiliationName": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department\u2013UF G\u00e9nopathies, CHU Lille, Univ Lille, Inserm UMR-S 1172"}, "56117309800": {"Name": "Jensen H.", "AuthorID": "56117309800", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, The Kennedy Eye Clinic, Rigshospitalet Glostrup"}, "57220443453": {"Name": "Rosenberg T.", "AuthorID": "57220443453", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, The Kennedy Eye Clinic, Rigshospitalet Glostrup"}}}
