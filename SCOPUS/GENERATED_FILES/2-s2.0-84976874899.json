The experimental diffusion coefficients were measured in the range 2-5 \u00d7 10-10 m2 s-1 and simulated diffusion coefficients calculated in the range of 1.6-3.2 \u00d7 10-9 m2 s-1. Activation energies were measured as 8.8 and 6.9 kJ mol-1 using QENS and MD respectively. Differences may be attributed predominantly to the experimental use of a dealuminated HY sample, containing significant defects such as strongly adsorbing silanol nests, compared to a perfect simulated crystal containing only evenly distributed Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. Experimental and simulated diffusivities measured in this study are lower than those obtained from those previously calculated in siliceous faujasite, due to methanol H-bonding to Br\u00f8nsted acid sites as observed in the MD simulations. However, both experimental and simulated diffusivities were significantly higher than those obtained in NaX, due to the higher concentration of extraframework cations present in the previously studied structures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976874899", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55913822400": {"Name": "O'Malley A.J.", "AuthorID": "55913822400", "AffiliationID": "60170248, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "UK Catalysis Hub, Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "7401647290": {"Name": "Parker S.F.", "AuthorID": "7401647290", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "11539776500": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda Sakai V.", "AuthorID": "11539776500", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "15073619700": {"Name": "Silverwood I.P.", "AuthorID": "15073619700", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "6507384807": {"Name": "Dimitratos N.", "AuthorID": "6507384807", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}}}
