Unfortunately, clinical graft manufacture using amnion can be inconsistent. Therefore, we have developed an alternative substrate, Real Architecture for 3D Tissue (RAFT), which supports human limbal epithelial cells (hLE) expansion. Epithelial organization is improved when human limbal fibroblasts (hLF) are incorporated into RAFT tissue equivalent (TE). However, hLF have the potential to transdifferentiate into a pro-scarring cell type, which would be incompatible with therapeutic transplantation. The aim of this work was to assess the scarring phenotype of hLF in RAFT TEs in hLE+ and hLE - RAFT TEs and in nonairlifted and airlifted RAFT TEs. Diseased fibroblasts (dFib) isolated from the fibrotic conjunctivae of ocular mucous membrane pemphigoid (Oc-MMP) patients were used as a pro-scarring positive control against which hLF were compared using surrogate scarring parameters: matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, de novo collagen synthesis, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) secretion. Normal hLF and dFib maintained different phenotypes in RAFT TE. MMP-2 and -9 activity, de novo collagen synthesis, and \u03b1-SMA expression were all increased in dFib cf. normal hLF RAFT TEs, although TGF-\u03b21 secretion did not differ between normal hLF and dFib RAFT TEs. Normal hLF do not progress toward a scarring-like phenotype during culture in RAFT TEs and, therefore, may be safe to include in therapeutic RAFT TE, where they can support hLE, although in vivo work is required to confirm this. dFib RAFT TEs (used in this study as a positive control) may be useful toward the development of an ex vivo disease model of Oc-MMP.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative substrates", "Amniotic membranes", "Collagen synthesis", "Disease modeling", "Epithelial cells", "Matrix metalloproteinases", "Smooth muscle actins", "Transforming growth factors", "Antigens, Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Conjunctival Diseases", "Corneal Injuries", "Epithelial Cells", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929720163", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"38862267100": {"Name": "Massie I.", "AuthorID": "38862267100", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56654892500": {"Name": "Dale S.B.", "AuthorID": "56654892500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35585570700": {"Name": "Daniels J.T.", "AuthorID": "35585570700", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
