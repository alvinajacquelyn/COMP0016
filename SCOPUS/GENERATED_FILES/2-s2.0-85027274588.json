Herein a novel numerical approach using a refined Large Eddy Simulation (LES) code to simulate the performance of a VATT is presented. The turbine blades are modelled with Lagrangian markers using the Immersed Boundary Method which offers several advantages especially concerning computational effort. Comparisons of the LES results with experimental and numerical data suggest reasonably good accuracy of the code. In addition, the stability of the method for high Reynolds number flows is also discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027274588", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57195336899": {"Name": "Barba P.O.", "AuthorID": "57195336899", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Hydro-Environmental Research Group, School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Hydro-Environmental Research Group, School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "55877278800": {"Name": "McSherry R.", "AuthorID": "55877278800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Hydro-Environmental Research Group, School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}}}
