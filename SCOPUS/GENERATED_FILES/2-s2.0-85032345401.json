Using an individual-based model, based on the assumptions of Haldane and Maynard Smith, respectively, we estimate that a surprisingly low number of 50\u2013100 loci are the most that could be under selection in a cultivation regime at the selection strengths observed in the archaeological record. This finding is robust to attempts to rescue populations from extinction through selection from high standing genetic variation, gene flow, and the Maynard Smith-based model of threshold selection. Selective sweeps come at a cost, reducing the capacity of plants to adapt to new environments, which may contribute to the explanation of why selective sweeps have not been detected more frequently and why expansion of the agrarian package during the Neolithic was so frequently associated with collapse.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cost of selection", "domestication", "Haldane", "Maynard-Smith"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032345401", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"6602620692": {"Name": "Allaby R.", "AuthorID": "6602620692", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick"}, "55226214900": {"Name": "Kitchen J.", "AuthorID": "55226214900", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Warwick"}, "57208724215": {"Name": "Fuller D.", "AuthorID": "57208724215", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
