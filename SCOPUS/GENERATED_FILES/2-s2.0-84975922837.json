All rights reserved.Children undergoing major urological reconstructive procedures require long-term follow-up through adolescence into adulthood. Most pediatric urology centers have a transitional care pathway through which these children are managed. Problems that may arise include problems with the bladder such as metabolic problems, mucus, stone formation and malignant change in augmented bladders; issues with incontinence and upper urinary tract deterioration and intrinsic renal failure due to conditions such as posterior urethral valves. Follow-up is also required for children undergoing surgery for disorders of sex development, or any genital (clitoral or penile) surgery.
