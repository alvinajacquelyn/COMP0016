We propose a numerical method for recovering discontinuous conductivity distributions, by reformulating it as an optimization problem with L 1 fitting and total variation penalty subject to PDE constraints. We establish continuity and differentiability results for the forward map, and the well-posedness of the optimization problem, and present an easy-to-implement and robust numerical method based on successive linearization, smoothing and iterative reweighting. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acousto-electric tomography", "reconstruction", "total variation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acousto-electric", "Conductivity distributions", "Iterative reweighting", "Numerical experiments", "Numerical reconstruction", "Optimization problems", "Total variation", "Total variation regularization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064449739", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56493013300": {"Name": "Adesokan B.", "AuthorID": "56493013300", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "7403218417": {"Name": "Jensen B.", "AuthorID": "7403218417", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "57201577841": {"Name": "Knudsen K.", "AuthorID": "57201577841", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark"}, "8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
