Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), with late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and T1 mapping, is emerging as a reference standard for diagnosis and characterization of cardiac amyloidosis. Objectives The authors used CMR with extracellular volume fraction (ECV) measurement to characterize cardiac involvement in relation to outcome in ATTR. Methods Subjects comprised 263 patients with cardiac ATTR corroborated by grade 2 to 3 99mTc-DPD (99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid) cardiac uptake, 17 with suspected cardiac ATTR (grade 1 99mTc-DPD), and 12 asymptomatic individuals with amyloidogenic transthyretin (TTR) mutations. Fifty patients with cardiac light-chain (AL) amyloidosis acted as disease comparators. Results Unlike cardiac AL amyloidosis, asymmetrical septal left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was present in 79% of patients with ATTR (70% sigmoid septum and 30% reverse septal contour), whereas symmetrical LVH was present in 18%, and 3% had no LVH. In patients with cardiac amyloidosis, the pattern of LGE was always typical for amyloidosis (29% subendocardial, 71% transmural), including right ventricular LGE (96%). During follow-up (19 \u00b1 14 months), 65 patients died. ECV independently correlated with mortality and remained independent after adjustment for age, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, ejection fraction, E/E\u2032, and left ventricular mass (hazard ratio: 1.164; 95% confidence interval: 1.066 to 1.271; p < 0.01). Conclusions Asymmetrical hypertrophy, traditionally associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, was the commonest pattern of ventricular remodeling in ATTR. LGE imaging was typical in all patients with cardiac ATTR. ECV correlated with amyloid burden and was an independent prognostic factor for survival in this cohort of patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATTR", "extracellular volume fraction", "late gadolinium enhancement", "left ventricular hypertrophy", "N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Cardiomyopathies", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028607026", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55343433500": {"Name": "Martinez-Naharro A.", "AuthorID": "55343433500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57193211591": {"Name": "Zumbo G.", "AuthorID": "57193211591", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55589453200": {"Name": "Knight D.S.", "AuthorID": "55589453200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "38661453500": {"Name": "Kotecha T.", "AuthorID": "38661453500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57194779300": {"Name": "Francis R.", "AuthorID": "57194779300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "55985822300": {"Name": "Hutt D.F.", "AuthorID": "55985822300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55985701600": {"Name": "Rezk T.", "AuthorID": "55985701600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56619484400": {"Name": "Quarta C.C.", "AuthorID": "56619484400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "36647033100": {"Name": "Whelan C.J.", "AuthorID": "36647033100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, West Smithfield"}, "56528300800": {"Name": "Abdel-Gadir A.", "AuthorID": "56528300800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, West Smithfield"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, West Smithfield"}, "35620856500": {"Name": "Rosmini S.", "AuthorID": "35620856500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, West Smithfield"}, "53981151600": {"Name": "Bulluck H.", "AuthorID": "53981151600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7004851504": {"Name": "Kellman P.", "AuthorID": "7004851504", "AffiliationID": "60005281, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}}}
