Objective: To systematically review trials of prostate radiotherapy. Design, setting, and participants: Using a prospective framework (framework for adaptive meta-analysis [FAME]), we prespecified methods before any trial results were known. We searched extensively for eligible trials and asked investigators when results would be available. We could then anticipate that a definitive meta-analysis of the effects of prostate radiotherapy was possible. We obtained prepublication, unpublished, and harmonised results from investigators. Intervention: We included trials that randomised men to prostate radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)or ADT only. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Hazard ratios (HRs)for the effects of prostate radiotherapy on survival, progression-free survival (PFS), failure-free survival (FFS), biochemical progression, and subgroup interactions were combined using fixed-effect meta-analysis. Results and limitations: We identified one ongoing (PEACE-1)and two completed (HORRAD and STAMPEDE)eligible trials. Pooled results of the latter (2126 men; 90% of those eligible)showed no overall improvement in survival (HR = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]0.81\u20131.04, p = 0.195)or PFS (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.84\u20131.05, p = 0.238)with prostate radiotherapy. There was an overall improvement in biochemical progression (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.67\u20130.82, p = 0.94 \u00d7 10\u22128)and FFS (HR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.69\u20130.84, p = 0.64 \u00d7 10\u22127), equivalent to \u223c10% benefit at 3 yr. The effect of prostate radiotherapy varied by metastatic burden\u2014a pattern consistent across trials and outcome measures, including survival (<5, \u22655; interaction HR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.11\u20131.94, p = 0.007). There was 7% improvement in 3-yr survival in men with fewer than five bone metastases. Conclusions: Prostate radiotherapy should be considered for men with mHSPC with a low metastatic burden. Patient summary: Prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastases)is usually treated with hormone therapy. In men with fewer than five bone metastases, addition of prostate radiotherapy helped them live longer and should be considered.\u00a9 2019 The AuthorsThis prospectively designed systematic review showed that prostate radiotherapy did not improve survival in unselected men. A difference in effect by metastatic burden was evident across included trials and outcomes; 3-yr survival increased by 7% in men with fewer than five bone metastases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Androgen deprivation therapy", "Meta-analysis", "Metastases", "Prostate cancer", "Radiotherapy", "Standard of care", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Neoplasms", "Disease-Free Survival", "Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Humans", "Male", "Orchiectomy", "Progression-Free Survival", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Survival Rate", "Tumor Burden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062079496", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"6601959922": {"Name": "Burdett S.", "AuthorID": "6601959922", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Meta-analysis Group, MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "55604307900": {"Name": "Fisher D.J.", "AuthorID": "55604307900", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Meta-analysis Group, MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "22836554400": {"Name": "Rydzewska L.H.", "AuthorID": "22836554400", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Meta-analysis Group, MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "7005266088": {"Name": "Vale C.L.", "AuthorID": "7005266088", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Meta-analysis Group, MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "7101757009": {"Name": "Tierney J.F.", "AuthorID": "7101757009", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Meta-analysis Group, MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "24472876500": {"Name": "Boev\u00e9 L.M.", "AuthorID": "24472876500", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Amsterdam UMC (VU)"}, "6603746988": {"Name": "van Andel G.", "AuthorID": "6603746988", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Amsterdam UMC (VU)"}, "57205510314": {"Name": "Ingleby F.C.", "AuthorID": "57205510314", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "7102310808": {"Name": "Parmar M.K.", "AuthorID": "7102310808", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "55836382400": {"Name": "Sydes M.R.", "AuthorID": "55836382400", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "7201772622": {"Name": "Clarke N.W.", "AuthorID": "7201772622", "AffiliationID": "60008873, 60028784", "AffiliationName": "The Christie and Salford Royal Hospitals"}, "7004100305": {"Name": "Hulshof M.C.", "AuthorID": "7004100305", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, Amsterdam UMC (AMC)"}, "7101943950": {"Name": "James N.D.", "AuthorID": "7101943950", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57202591312": {"Name": "Parker C.C.", "AuthorID": "57202591312", "AffiliationID": "60011472, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7102862991": {"Name": "Sweeney C.J.", "AuthorID": "7102862991", "AffiliationID": "60014334", "AffiliationName": "Dana-Faber Cancer Institute"}, "55111143600": {"Name": "Tombal B.", "AuthorID": "55111143600", "AffiliationID": "60012936", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint Luc"}, "7003335088": {"Name": "Verhagen P.C.", "AuthorID": "7003335088", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Erasmus Medical Centre"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
