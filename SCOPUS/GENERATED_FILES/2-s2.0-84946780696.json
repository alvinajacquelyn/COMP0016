However, there is also evidence that the nonlinear acoustic properties are also sensitive to material microstructure. As many industrially relevant materials have a polycrystalline structure, this could potentially complicate the monitoring of material processes when using nonlinear acoustics. Variations in the nonlinear acoustoelastic coefficient on the same length scale as the microstructure of a polycrystalline sample of aluminum are investigated in this paper. This is achieved by the development of a measurement protocol that allows imaging of the acoustoelastic response of a material across a samples surface at the same time as imaging the microstructure. The development, validation, and limitations of this technique are discussed. The nonlinear acoustic response is found to vary spatially by a large factor (>20) between different grains. A relationship is observed when the spatial variation of the acoustoelastic coefficient is compared to the variation in material microstructure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Material microstructures", "Measurement protocol", "Nonlinear acoustic techniques", "Polycrystalline samples", "Polycrystalline structure", "Sensitivity to variations", "Surface acoustic waves", "Ultrasonic techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946780696", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57197977524": {"Name": "Ellwood R.", "AuthorID": "57197977524", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Optics Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "6603544885": {"Name": "Stratoudaki T.", "AuthorID": "6603544885", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Optics Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "57189287673": {"Name": "Sharples S.", "AuthorID": "57189287673", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Optics Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "7404528098": {"Name": "Clark M.", "AuthorID": "7404528098", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Optics Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Nottingham"}, "7005207264": {"Name": "Somekh M.", "AuthorID": "7005207264", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}}}
