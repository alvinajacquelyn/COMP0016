However, little is known about how those traits vary in populations or correlate across individuals. Here we test whether those three cognitive domains are correlated manifestations of an underlying factor, analogous to the psychometric \u2018g\u2019 factor, or independent \u2018behavioural phenotypes\u2019, analogous to the \u2018Big-Five\u2019 personality components. We selected eight variables measuring introspection and extraversion, verbal and physical imitation, cooperation and punishment, and evaluated their individual variability, domain-consistency and sub-structuring in a sample of 84 individuals. Results show high variation and limited clustering into three independent \u2018behavioural phenotypes\u2019 of introspection, imitation and cooperation. Only one significant correlation was identified (between two measures of extraversion), while other within-domain measures (introspection vs. extraversion, verbal vs. physical imitation, and cooperation vs. punishment) were not associated. Finally, no between-domain association was identified either through correlations or factor analysis. Overall, the results do not lend support to the hypothesis of a general \u2018behavioural phenotype\u2019 underlying individual behaviour. The independence of behaviours of introspection, imitation and cooperation may be the reason why individuals are able to adopt different behavioural strategies (combinations of behavioural phenotypes) and play distinct roles in the maintenance of human distinctive features such as hyper-cooperation and cumulative culture.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "Cooperation", "Imitation", "Introspection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996931800", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"]], "AuthorData": {"57192091602": {"Name": "Bentzen-Bilkvist D.", "AuthorID": "57192091602", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "23393347700": {"Name": "Migliano A.", "AuthorID": "23393347700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "8927926800": {"Name": "Vinicius L.", "AuthorID": "8927926800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}}}
