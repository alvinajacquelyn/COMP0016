One of the most significant, yet understudied, forms of PPP to emerge in recent years is the public\u2013private joint venture (PPJV). Unlike contractual PPPs, in which public organizations specify the service to be provided under contract by private sector organizations, PPJVs involve the creation of a new institutional entity that is governed by all of the parties in the alliance. This paper examines the distinctive character of PPJVs and draws on documentary and case study evidence to evaluate the ways in which the mixing of public and private within this important collaborative form can be managed best.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaboration management", "joint ventures", "management dilemmas", "public\u2013 private partnerships", "public\u2013private sector differences"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929308401", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"]], "AuthorData": {"9637387400": {"Name": "Andrews R.", "AuthorID": "9637387400", "AffiliationID": "60170149, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University"}, "54899511900": {"Name": "Esteve M.", "AuthorID": "54899511900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Policy.
