Investigation of lighting effects requires better understanding of the nature of this task as expressed by the typical distance at which the judgement is made (and hence visual size) and the duration of observation, which in past studies have been arbitrary. Better understanding will help with interpretation of the significance of lighting characteristics such as illuminance and light spectrum. Conclusions of comfort distance in past studies are not consistent and hence this article presents new data determined using eye-tracking. We propose that further work on interpersonal judgements should examine the effects of lighting at a distance of 15 m with an observation duration of 500 ms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Eye-tracking", "Further works", "Light spectrum", "Lighting effects", "Road lighting", "Visual components"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938082306", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6602873224": {"Name": "Fotios S.", "AuthorID": "6602873224", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Arts Tower"}, "56571783400": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "56571783400", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Arts Tower"}, "56031473200": {"Name": "Uttley J.", "AuthorID": "56031473200", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Arts Tower"}}}
