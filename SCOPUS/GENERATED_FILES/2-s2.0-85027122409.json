Methods: Isolates comprised KPC-positive K. pneumoniae (n = 33), Escherichia coli (n = 7) and Enterobacter spp. (n = 4) referred to the national reference laboratory between 2008 and 2010 from17 UK centres, including three in North-West England. Isolates were typed by MLST. Plasmids were transferred by electroporation and characterized by PCR or sequencing. PCR screening assays were developed to distinguish plasmid pKpQIL variants. Results: The K. pneumoniae isolates included 10 STs, of which three belonged to clonal group (CG) 258. CG258 (n = 19) isolates were detected in 13 centres but accounted for only 7/19 (36.8%) of those from North-West England. Most KPC-producers (37/44, 84.1%), including 16/19 CG258 K. pneumoniae, carried blaKPC on IncFIIK2 plasmids. Sequencing of a subset of these plasmids (n = 11) revealed similarities with published pKpQIL. One variant, pKpQIL-UK [identified in K. pneumoniae CG258 (n = 5) and ST468 (n = 1) isolates from distinct centres] had only a few nucleotide changes from classical pKpQIL, whereas pKpQIL-D1 (n = 1) and pKpQIL-D2 (n = 4), from isolates of various species in the North-West, harboured large variations, reflecting replacement of the partitioning and replication functions and potentially thereby facilitating spread. PCR revealed that 36/37 (97.3%) IncFIIK2-type plasmids in KPC-positive isolates had pKpQIL markers. Conclusions: pKpQIL-like plasmids played a major role in the early dissemination of KPC enzymes in the UK.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Proteins", "beta-Lactamases", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Enterobacteriaceae", "Enterobacteriaceae Infections", "Gene Transfer, Horizontal", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Multilocus Sequence Typing", "Plasmids", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027122409", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6602230553": {"Name": "Doumith M.", "AuthorID": "6602230553", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "42461482400": {"Name": "Findlay J.", "AuthorID": "42461482400", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57195327678": {"Name": "Hirani H.", "AuthorID": "57195327678", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57206470677": {"Name": "Hopkins K.L.", "AuthorID": "57206470677", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7103209438": {"Name": "Livermore D.M.", "AuthorID": "7103209438", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "7005737009": {"Name": "Woodford N.", "AuthorID": "7005737009", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare Associated Infections (AMRHAI) Reference Unit, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "6506919910": {"Name": "Dodgson A.", "AuthorID": "6506919910", "AffiliationID": "100347568", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Laboratory"}}}
