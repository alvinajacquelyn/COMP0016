One method to study monoaminergic systems in humans is to measure monoamine end-point metabolite concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here, we analyzed CSF monoamine metabolite concentrations in 103 adults with bipolar disorder, 72 adults with ADHD, and 113 controls. Individuals with bipolar disorder had significantly higher homovanillic acid (HVA, 264 \u00b1 112 nmol/L, p < 0.001) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA, 116 \u00b1 42 nmol/L, p = 0.001) concentration, but lower 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (MHPG, 38 \u00b1 8 nmol/L, p < 0.001) concentrations than controls (HVA, 206 \u00b1 70 nmol/L; 5-HIAA, 98 \u00b1 31 nmol/L; and MHPG, 42 \u00b1 7 nmol/L). Higher HVA concentrations were associated with a history of psychosis in the bipolar disorder sample. Subjects with ADHD had higher HVA (240 \u00b1 94 nmol/L, p < 0.001) concentrations compared with controls. In addition, SSRI treatment was associated with lower 5-HIAA concentrations in both patient groups. A power analysis indicated that for within-group comparisons, only large effects would be reliably detectable. Thus, there may be moderate-to-small effects caused by medication that were not detected due to the limited size of the sub-groups in these analyses. In conclusion, the present study suggests disorder-specific alterations of CSF monoamine metabolite concentrations in patients with bipolar disorder and ADHD compared with controls; these differences were independent of acute symptoms and medication effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADHD", "Bipolar disorder", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Dopamine", "Monoamines", "Norepinephrine", "Serotonin"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021274450", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"6603374219": {"Name": "P\u00e5lsson E.", "AuthorID": "6603374219", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7004259279": {"Name": "Land\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "7004259279", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "24725740600": {"Name": "Ryd\u00e9n E.", "AuthorID": "24725740600", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychiatry, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57215630858": {"Name": "Kizza R.", "AuthorID": "57215630858", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Section of Psychiatry, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "57189000341": {"Name": "Pelanis A.", "AuthorID": "57189000341", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "37020689800": {"Name": "Sellgren C.", "AuthorID": "37020689800", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
