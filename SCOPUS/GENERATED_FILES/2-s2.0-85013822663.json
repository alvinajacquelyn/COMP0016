American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.The timing and mechanisms involved in creating the elevated, low-relief topography of the South African plateau remain unresolved. Here we constrain the thermal history of the Southwest African plateau since 300 Ma by using apatite fission track (AFT) and (U-Th-Sm)/He (AHe) thermochronology. Archean rocks from the center of the Kaapvaal Craton yield AFT ages of 331.0 \u00b1 11.0 and 379.0 \u00b1 23.0 Ma and mean track lengths (MTLs) of 11.9 \u00b1 0.2 and 12.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m. Toward the southwest margin of the craton and in the adjacent Paleozoic mobile belt, AFT ages are significantly younger and range from 58.9 \u00b1 5.9 to 128.7 \u00b1 6.3 Ma and have longer MTLs (>13 \u00b5m). The range of sample AHe ages complements the AFT ages, and single-grain AHe ages for most samples are highly dispersed. Results from joint inverse modeling of these data reveal that the center of the craton has resided at near-surface temperatures (<60\u00b0C) since 300 Ma, whereas the margins of the craton and the off-craton mobile belt experienced two discrete episodes of cooling during the Cretaceous. An Early Cretaceous cooling episode is ascribed to regional denudation following continental breakup. Late Cretaceous cooling occurs regionally but is locally variable and may be a result of a complex interaction between mantle-driven uplift and the tectonic setting of the craton margin. Across the entire plateau, samples are predicted to have remained at near-surface temperatures throughout the Cenozoic, suggesting minimal denudation (<1 km) and relative tectonic stability of the plateau.", "AuthorKeywords": ["apatite", "craton stability", "landscape evolution", "South Africa", "tectonics", "thermochronology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013822663", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56257995500": {"Name": "Wildman M.", "AuthorID": "56257995500", "AffiliationID": "60070475", "AffiliationName": "Now at G\u00e9osciences Rennes, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes"}, "7408438047": {"Name": "Brown R.", "AuthorID": "7408438047", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, College of Science and Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "20436807700": {"Name": "Persano C.", "AuthorID": "20436807700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographical and Earth Sciences, College of Science and Engineering, University of Glasgow"}, "55658946700": {"Name": "Beucher R.", "AuthorID": "55658946700", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Now at School of Earth Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "35582943700": {"Name": "Stuart F.M.", "AuthorID": "35582943700", "AffiliationID": "60017641", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre"}, "57193416261": {"Name": "Mackintosh V.", "AuthorID": "57193416261", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "7103006899": {"Name": "Gallagher K.", "AuthorID": "7103006899", "AffiliationID": "60070475", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Rennes, Universit\u00e9 de Rennes"}, "6506569994": {"Name": "Schwanethal J.", "AuthorID": "6506569994", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56003358600": {"Name": "Carter A.", "AuthorID": "56003358600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of London"}}}
