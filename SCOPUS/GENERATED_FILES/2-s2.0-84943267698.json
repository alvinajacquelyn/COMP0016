For this to be effective, host range and viability following nebulization need to be assessed. Host-range has not previously been assessed for the Liverpool Epidemic Strain (LES) isolates that are the most common cystic fibrosis-related clone of P. aeruginosa in the UK. Nebulization studies have not previously been linked to clinically relevant phages. Methods: 84 phenotypically variable isolates of the LES were tested for susceptibility to seven bacteriophages known to have activity against P. aeruginosa. Five of the phages were from the Eliava Institute (IBMV) and 2 were isolated in this study. The viability of the two bacteriophages with the largest host ranges was characterized further to determine their ability to be nebulized and delivered to the lower airways. Phages were nebulized into a cascade impactor and the phage concentration was measured. Results: The bacteriophages tested killed between 66%-98% of the 84 Liverpool Epidemic Strain isolates. Two isolates were multi phage resistant, but were sensitive to most first line anti-Pseudomonal antibiotics. The amount of viable bacteriophages contained in particles that are likely to reach the lower airways (<4.7 \u03bcm) was 1% for the Omron and 12% AeroEclipse nebulizer. Conclusions: Individual P. aeruginosa bacteriophages can lyse up to 98% of 84 phenotypically diverse LES strains. High titers of phages can be effectively nebulized.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bacteriophages", "cystic fibrosis", "nebulization", "P. aeruginosa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Therapy", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Humans", "Nebulizers and Vaporizers", "Phenotype", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Pseudomonas Infections", "Pseudomonas Phages"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943267698", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57196392941": {"Name": "Sahota J.S.", "AuthorID": "57196392941", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester, Maurice Shock Building, Lab 105"}, "26664945800": {"Name": "Smith C.M.", "AuthorID": "26664945800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care, and Anaesthesia, University College London, Institute of Child Health, London, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57211999961": {"Name": "O'Callaghan C.", "AuthorID": "57211999961", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care, and Anaesthesia, University College London, Institute of Child Health, London, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "6507414291": {"Name": "Clokie M.R.J.", "AuthorID": "6507414291", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Inflammation, University of Leicester, Maurice Shock Building, Lab 105"}, "56025951100": {"Name": "Radhakrishnan P.", "AuthorID": "56025951100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care, and Anaesthesia, University College London, Institute of Child Health, London, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7005018308": {"Name": "Winstanley C.", "AuthorID": "7005018308", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Infection Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "7005011197": {"Name": "Kadioglu A.", "AuthorID": "7005011197", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Infection Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "6506222670": {"Name": "Goderdzishvili M.", "AuthorID": "6506222670", "AffiliationID": "60077523", "AffiliationName": "Eliava Institute of Bacteriophages, Microbiology, and Virology"}, "12545949700": {"Name": "Chanishvili N.", "AuthorID": "12545949700", "AffiliationID": "60077523", "AffiliationName": "Eliava Institute of Bacteriophages, Microbiology, and Virology"}}}
