They can be reinterpreted as systems of exchanges for providing resources based on the main principles of liberty, equality and solidarity. Depending on the different possible dialectical relations between these three principles, they lead to different social cohesion regimes. This paper is the first attempt to empirically test this hypothesis at a European level by elaborating a measure of social cohesion based on values and creating a typology of social cohesion regimes. In comparison to welfare regimes, it invites to go one step further by considering the articulation between the three main principles and proposes a more precise classification for countries. The results invite further research on the links between welfare and social cohesion regimes. The analysis is based on data from the 2008 European Values Study (EVS) in 43 countries using principal component analysis, multidimensional scaling and cluster analyses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cluster analysis", "EVS", "multidimensional scaling", "Social cohesion", "values", "welfare typology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964466710", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"35191642600": {"Name": "Borsenberger M.", "AuthorID": "35191642600", "AffiliationID": "60116751", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement Conditions de vie, LISER, Esch-sur-Alzette"}, "13006716500": {"Name": "Dickes P.", "AuthorID": "13006716500", "AffiliationID": "60104289", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire InterPsy, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine"}, "57188984647": {"Name": "Fleury C.", "AuthorID": "57188984647", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de sociologie, Facult\u00e9 des sciences sociales, Universit\u00e9 Laval"}}}
