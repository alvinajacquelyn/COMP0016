The heterogeneity of neurons based on their distinct transmission modes and firing patterns has been recognized for decades, and is necessary to coordinate the immense variety of functions of the CNS. More recently, heterogeneity in glial cells has been identified, including heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and oligodendrocytes. OPC subpopulations have been described based on their developmental origin, anatomical location in the grey or white matter, and expression of surface receptors. Oligodendrocytes are categorised according to differences in gene expression, myelinogenic potential, and axon specificity. Much of what is described as heterogeneity in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs) is based on phenotypic differences. However, without evidence for functional differences between putative subgroups of OLCs, distinguishing heterogeneity from plasticity and lineage state is difficult. Identifying functional differences between phenotypically distinct groups are therefore necessary for a deeper understanding of the role of OLCs in health and disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["heterogeneity", "myelin", "oligodendrocyte", "oligodendrocyte progenitor cell", "remyelination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Central Nervous System", "Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells", "Oligodendroglia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064152828", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57132534000": {"Name": "Foerster S.", "AuthorID": "57132534000", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Clifford Allbutt Building, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, University of Cambridge"}, "56609640200": {"Name": "Hill M.F.E.", "AuthorID": "56609640200", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Clifford Allbutt Building, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, University of Cambridge"}, "56186256600": {"Name": "Franklin R.J.M.", "AuthorID": "56186256600", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Clifford Allbutt Building, Cambridge Biomedical Campus, University of Cambridge"}}}
