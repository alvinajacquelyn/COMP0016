Previous work by Williamson et al. (2001) [35] and Alf\u00e8 and Gillan, (2004) [36] has demonstrated the reduction of the O(N3) cost of evaluating the Slater determinant with planewaves to O(N2) using localized basis functions. We compare four polynomial approximations as basis functions - interpolating Lagrange polynomials, interpolating piecewise-polynomial-form (pp-) splines, and basis-form (B-) splines (interpolating and smoothing). All these basis functions provide a similar speedup relative to the planewave basis. The pp-splines have eight times the memory requirement of the other methods. To test the accuracy of the basis functions, we apply them to the ground state structures of Si, Al, and MgO. The polynomial approximations differ in accuracy most strongly for MgO, and smoothing B-splines most closely reproduce the planewave value for of the variational Monte Carlo energy. Using separate approximations for the Laplacian of the orbitals increases the accuracy sufficiently to justify the increased memory requirement, making smoothing B-splines, with separate approximation for the Laplacian, the preferred choice for approximating planewave-represented orbitals in QMC calculations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B-splines", "Quantum Monte Carlo"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923044488", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36864503100": {"Name": "Parker W.D.", "AuthorID": "36864503100", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Ohio State University"}, "7005302346": {"Name": "Hennig R.G.", "AuthorID": "7005302346", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science and Engineering, University of Florida"}, "7201997413": {"Name": "Wilkins J.W.", "AuthorID": "7201997413", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Ohio State University"}, "6602612000": {"Name": "Umrigar C.J.", "AuthorID": "6602612000", "AffiliationID": "60027191, 60007776", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics, Cornell University"}, "8837867700": {"Name": "Petruzielo F.R.", "AuthorID": "8837867700", "AffiliationID": "60027191, 60007776", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics, Cornell University"}, "7004035504": {"Name": "Alf\u00e8 D.", "AuthorID": "7004035504", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
