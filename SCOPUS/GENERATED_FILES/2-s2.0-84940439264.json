Loss of DAX-1 function is classically associated with X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. This condition typically affects boys and presents as primary adrenal insufficiency in early infancy or childhood, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism at puberty and impaired spermatogenesis. Late onset forms of this condition and variant phenotypes are increasingly recognized. In contrast, disruption of SF-1 only rarely causes adrenal insufficiency, usually in combination with testicular dysgenesis. Variants in SF-1/NR5A1 more commonly cause a spectrum of reproductive phenotypes ranging from 46,XY DSD (partial testicular dysgenesis or reduced androgen production) and hypospadias to male factor infertility or primary ovarian insufficiency. Making a specific diagnosis of DAX-1 or SF-1 associated conditions is important for long-term monitoring of endocrine and reproductive function, appropriate genetic counselling for family members, and for providing appropriate informed support for young people.", "AuthorKeywords": ["46,XY disorders of sex development", "Addison disease", "DAX-1", "hypogonadotropic hypogonadism", "hypospadias", "infertility", "primary adrenal insufficiency", "primary ovarian insufficiency", "SF-1", "X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Insufficiency", "DAX-1 Orphan Nuclear Receptor", "Genetic Diseases, X-Linked", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Steroidogenic Factor 1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940439264", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"56656643600": {"Name": "Suntharalingham J.", "AuthorID": "56656643600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55899663600": {"Name": "Buonocore F.", "AuthorID": "55899663600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56504631500": {"Name": "Duncan A.", "AuthorID": "56504631500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7003478493": {"Name": "Achermann J.", "AuthorID": "7003478493", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
