For solidstate potentials, of the different classes of potentials available experimentally for conjugated polymers, the class measured under conditions which are the most similar to those during water splitting, we find a good fit between the ionization potentials predicted using \u0394B3LYP and those measured experimentally using photoemission spectroscopy (PES). We also observe a reasonable fit to the more limited data sets of excited-state ionization potentials, obtained from two-photon PES, and electron affinities, measured by inverse PES, respectively. Through a comparison of solid-state potentials with gas phase and solution potentials for a range of oligomers, we demonstrate how the quality of the fit to experimental solid-state data is probably the result of benign error cancellation. We discuss that the good fit for solid-state potentials in vacuum suggests that a similar accuracy can be expected for calculations on solid-state polymers interfaced with water. We also analyze the quality of approximating the \u0394B3LYP potentials by orbital energies. Finally, we discuss what a comparison between experimental and predicted potentials teaches us about conjugated polymers as photocatalysts, focusing specifically on the large exciton-binding energy in these systems and the mechanism of free charge carrier generation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Different class", "Error cancellation", "Exciton-binding energy", "Free charge carriers", "Limited data sets", "Orbital energy", "Redox potentials", "Water splitting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027255456", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"55805566600": {"Name": "Guiglion P.", "AuthorID": "55805566600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55871478600": {"Name": "Monti A.", "AuthorID": "55871478600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
