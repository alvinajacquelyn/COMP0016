In this paper, we propose reducing the complexity of a blind symbol synchronization technique for direct detection OFDM receivers based on virtual subcarriers by optimizing the number and location of the virtual subcarriers. Compared to the system design in our previous study, this new technique offers a reduction of 92% in the number of virtual subcarriers (from 26 to 2 in a system with 50 data carrying subchannels) resulting in significant savings in complexity with a minimal penalty. Moreover, it offers an increase in the system capacity as more subcarriers can be used to transmit data. The technique was assessed experimentally using a transmission system of direct detection 16-QAM optical OFDM operating at a data rate of 30.65 Gb/s over 23.3 km SSMF with BER of 10-3. Negligible penalty was observed at high received powers. However, at low received powers, the number of averaging symbols had to be increased in order to improve the robustness of the method.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Blind symbol synchronizations", "Direct detection", "OFDM receiver", "Symbol synchronization", "System Capacity", "Transmission systems", "Transmit data", "Virtual subcarriers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978950316", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56066290300": {"Name": "Bouziane R.", "AuthorID": "56066290300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.I.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
