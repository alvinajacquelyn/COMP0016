We conducted a single-blind randomised controlled pilot trial comparing CT plus treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU only. Participants were assessed at end of treatment (4 months) and follow-up (7 months). Twenty-nine participants with schizophrenia spectrum disorders were randomised. CT incorporated up to 12 sessions over 4 months (mean sessions=9.3). Primary outcome was the Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale - Revised (ISMI-R) total score, which provides a continuous measure of internalised stigma associated with mental health problems. Secondary outcomes included self-rated recovery, internalised shame, emotional problems, hopelessness and self-esteem. Recruitment rates and retention for this trial were good. Changes in outcomes were analysed following the intention-to-treat principle, using ANCOVAs adjusted for baseline symptoms. There was no effect on our primary outcome, with a sizable reduction observed in both groups, but several secondary outcomes were significantly improved in the group assigned to CT, in comparison with TAU, including internalised shame, hopelessness and self-rated recovery. Stigma-focused CT appears feasible and acceptable in people with psychosis who have high levels of internalised stigma. A larger, definitive trial is required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive therapy", "Psychosis", "Schizophrenia", "Stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognitive Therapy", "Defense Mechanisms", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Psychotic Disorders", "Schizophrenia", "Self Concept", "Shame", "Single-Blind Method", "Social Stigma", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962910514", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"7402258312": {"Name": "Morrison A.P.", "AuthorID": "7402258312", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester West NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "56489883100": {"Name": "Burke E.", "AuthorID": "56489883100", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester West NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "55813099100": {"Name": "Pyle M.", "AuthorID": "55813099100", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester West NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "37114903900": {"Name": "Varese F.", "AuthorID": "37114903900", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7202513618": {"Name": "Wood L.J.", "AuthorID": "7202513618", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401683703": {"Name": "Murphy E.", "AuthorID": "7401683703", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester West NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "6603109695": {"Name": "Bowe S.", "AuthorID": "6603109695", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester West NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "56010836000": {"Name": "Chapman N.", "AuthorID": "56010836000", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester West NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "15847102200": {"Name": "Welford M.", "AuthorID": "15847102200", "AffiliationID": "60122796", "AffiliationName": "Greater Manchester West NHS Mental Health Foundation Trust"}, "7202885944": {"Name": "Dunn G.", "AuthorID": "7202885944", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60016726", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Research Group, School of Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "53879614700": {"Name": "Hutton P.", "AuthorID": "53879614700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}}}
