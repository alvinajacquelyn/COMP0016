Clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of early ART; however, these trials may miss an important real-world consequence of providing ART at diagnosis: its impact on retention in care. Methods and findings: We examined the effect of immediate (versus deferred) ART on retention in care using a regression discontinuity design. The analysis included all patients (N = 11,306) entering clinical HIV care with a first CD4 count between 12 August 2011 and 31 December 2012 in a public-sector HIV care and treatment program in rural South Africa. Patients were assigned to immediate versus deferred ART eligibility, as determined by a CD4 count < 350 cells/\u03bcl, per South African national guidelines. Patients referred to pre-ART care were instructed to return every 6 months for CD4 monitoring. Patients initiated on ART were instructed to return at 6 and 12 months post-initiation and annually thereafter for CD4 and viral load monitoring. We assessed retention in HIV care at 12 months, as measured by the presence of a clinic visit, lab test, or ART initiation 6 to 18 months after initial CD4 test. Differences in retention between patients presenting with CD4 counts just above versus just below the 350-cells/\u03bcl threshold were estimated using local linear regression models with a data-driven bandwidth and with the algorithm for selecting the bandwidth chosen ex ante. Among patients with CD4 counts close to the 350-cells/\u03bcl threshold, having an ART-eligible CD4 count (<350 cells/\u03bcl) was associated with higher 12-month retention than not having an ART-eligible CD4 count (50% versus 32%), an intention-to-treat risk difference of 18 percentage points (95% CI 11 to 23; p < 0.001). The decision to start ART was determined by CD4 count for one in four patients (25%) presenting close to the eligibility threshold (95% CI 20% to 31%; p < 0.001). In this subpopulation, having an ART-eligible CD4 count was associated with higher 12-month retention than not having an ART-eligible CD4 count (91% versus 21%), a complier causal risk difference of 70 percentage points (95% CI 42 to 98; p < 0.001). The major limitations of the study are the potential for limited generalizability, the potential for outcome misclassification, and the absence of data on longer-term health outcomes. Conclusions: Patients who were eligible for immediate ART had dramatically higher retention in HIV care than patients who just missed the CD4-count eligibility cutoff. The clinical and population health benefits of offering immediate ART regardless of CD4 count may be larger than suggested by clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Ambulatory Care", "Anti-HIV Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Public Sector", "Rural Population", "South Africa", "Treatment Adherence and Compliance", "Treatment Outcome", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036518157", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"35896972800": {"Name": "Bor J.", "AuthorID": "35896972800", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Witwatersrand"}, "7401718940": {"Name": "Fox M.P.", "AuthorID": "7401718940", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Witwatersrand"}, "7401609414": {"Name": "Rosen S.", "AuthorID": "7401609414", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Epidemiology Research Office, Department of Internal Medicine, School of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Witwatersrand"}, "6603089893": {"Name": "Tanser F.", "AuthorID": "6603089893", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection & Population Health, University College London"}, "7201727367": {"Name": "Pillay D.", "AuthorID": "7201727367", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, University College London"}, "23011726900": {"Name": "B\u00e4rnighausen T.", "AuthorID": "23011726900", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, University of Heidelberg"}, "15053753800": {"Name": "Venkataramani A.", "AuthorID": "15053753800", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}}}
