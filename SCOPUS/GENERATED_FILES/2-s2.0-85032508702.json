The hierarchical naming of the Named-Data Networking (NDN) architecture can be used to name groups of data values, for example, all temperature sensors in a building. However, the use of a single naming hierarchy for all kinds of di?erent applications is in?exible. Moreover, IoT data are typically retrieved from multiple sources at the same time, allowing applications to aggregate similar information items, something not natively supported by NDN. To this end, in this paper we propose (a) locating IoT data using (unordered) keywords combined with NDN names and (b) processing multiple such items at the edge of the network with arbitrary functions. We describe and evaluate three di?erent strategies for retrieving data and placing the calculations in the edge IoT network, thus combining connectivity, storage and computing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Edge computing", "ICN", "IoT", "NDN"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arbitrary functions", "Edge computing", "Information items", "Information-centric networkings (ICN)", "Internet of thing (IOT)", "Keyword-based", "Multiple source", "Named data networkings"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032508702", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"25926838500": {"Name": "Ascigil O.", "AuthorID": "25926838500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "17435754200": {"Name": "Re\u00f1\u00e9 S.", "AuthorID": "17435754200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "16048105300": {"Name": "Psaras I.", "AuthorID": "16048105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "6701809084": {"Name": "Xylomenos G.", "AuthorID": "6701809084", "AffiliationID": "60019507", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Informatics, Athens University of Economics and Business"}}}
