Understanding how to enhance their effectiveness is timely because of recent, growing interest in virtual reality and animated map presentation tools such as Esri Story Maps\u2122 and Google Earth\u2122 tours. Despite this popularity, little empirical evidence exists about how people learn from map tours and how they should best be designed to improve effectiveness. This research is aimed at answering that need. An empirical study is described, which was designed to understand how virtual camera speed, path, and dynamic tilting within a map tour influence subjects\u2019 ability to develop survey knowledge. The results of the experiment show that paths encompassing overviews of the landscape improve the viewer\u2019s ability to build up survey knowledge; that tilting appears to have a much weaker effect; and that combining fast speed and a difficult path within a map tour increases the viewer\u2019s cognitive load.", "AuthorKeywords": ["empirical study", "Esri Story Maps\u2122", "Google Earth\u2122 tour", "survey knowledge", "zoom and pan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive loads", "Empirical studies", "Google earths", "How people learn", "Presentation tools", "Spatial informations", "Survey knowledge", "zoom and pan"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013081007", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"19639536600": {"Name": "Treves R.", "AuthorID": "19639536600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and Environment, University of Southampton"}, "54966709700": {"Name": "Skarlatidou A.", "AuthorID": "54966709700", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
