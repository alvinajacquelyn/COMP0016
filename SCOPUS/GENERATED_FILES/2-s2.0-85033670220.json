Movement Disorders Clinical Practice published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.Background: Tetrabenazine is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved drug for Huntington's disease, and deutetrabenazine was recently tested against placebo. A switching-trial from tetrabenazine to deutetrabenazine is underway, but no head-to-head, blinded, randomized controlled trial is planned. Using meta-analytical methodology, the authors compared these molecules. Methods: RCTs comparing tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine with placebo in Huntington's disease were searched. The authors assessed the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, calculated indirect treatment comparisons, and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Results: The evidence network for this report comprised 1 tetrabenazine trial and 1 deutetrabenazine trial, both against placebo. Risk of bias was moderate in both. Participants in the tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine trials did not differ significantly on motor scores or adverse events. Depression and somnolence scales significantly favored deutetrabenazine. Conclusion: There is low-quality evidence that tetrabenazine and deutetrabenazine do not differ in efficacy or safety. It is important to note that these results are likely to remain the only head-to-head comparison between these 2 compounds in Huntington's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deutetrabenazine", "Huntington's disease", "indirect comparison", "meta-analysis", "tetrabenazine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033670220", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57191254295": {"Name": "Rodrigues F.B.", "AuthorID": "57191254295", "AffiliationID": "60021283", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular"}, "57206324805": {"Name": "Wild E.J.", "AuthorID": "57206324805", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Huntington's Disease Center, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57188702245": {"Name": "Duarte G.S.", "AuthorID": "57188702245", "AffiliationID": "60021283", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular"}, "35483370900": {"Name": "Costa J.", "AuthorID": "35483370900", "AffiliationID": "60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Center for Evidence-Based Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon"}, "57201370983": {"Name": "Ferreira J.J.", "AuthorID": "57201370983", "AffiliationID": "60021283", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Instituto de Medicina Molecular"}}}
