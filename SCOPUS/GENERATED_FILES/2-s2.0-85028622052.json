Questionnaires were distributed to 38 parents of VLBW infants and 36 parents of term infants within a hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Field notes were also taken. Parents indicated collecting outcome data in this population was feasible and acceptable, but barriers and difficulties in data collection were identified, particularly for fathers. Furthermore, parents highlighted a lack of emotional support for fathers. In conclusion, research with parents of VLBW infants should happen with consultation, flexibility and measures designed specifically for this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Father", "neonatal", "parents", "recruitment", "support"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adult", "Fathers", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Very Low Birth Weight", "Intensive Care, Neonatal", "Male", "Parents", "Social Support", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028622052", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Pediatrics", "NURS", "2919"]], "AuthorData": {"55933526300": {"Name": "Bagge S.R.", "AuthorID": "55933526300", "AffiliationID": "60160138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East Anglia"}, "56302396800": {"Name": "Walsh J.", "AuthorID": "56302396800", "AffiliationID": "60160138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East Anglia"}, "57189730802": {"Name": "Westgate B.", "AuthorID": "57189730802", "AffiliationID": "60117932", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "56946918300": {"Name": "Few K.", "AuthorID": "56946918300", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Norfolk, Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35232892800": {"Name": "Clarke P.", "AuthorID": "35232892800", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Norfolk, Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220235662": {"Name": "Adlam A.", "AuthorID": "57220235662", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "57190298386": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien M.", "AuthorID": "57190298386", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, University College London, Institute of Education"}}}
