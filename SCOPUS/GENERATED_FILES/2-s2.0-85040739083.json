Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The question whether evolution is blind is usually presented as a choice between no goals at all (\u2018the blind watchmaker\u2019) and long-term goals which would be external to the organism, for example in the form of special creation or intelligent design. The arguments either way do not address the question whether there are short-term goals within rather than external to organisms. Organisms and their interacting populations have evolved mechanisms by which they can harness blind stochasticity and so generate rapid functional responses to environmental challenges. They can achieve this by re-organising their genomes and/or their regulatory networks. Epigenetic as well as DNA changes are involved. Evolution may have no foresight, but it is at least partially directed by organisms themselves and by the populations of which they form part. Similar arguments support partial direction in the evolution of behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptability driver", "Blind chance", "Evolutionary hold mechanisms", "Harnessing stochasticity", "Hypermutation", "Internal and external goals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040739083", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"36892000300": {"Name": "Noble R.", "AuthorID": "36892000300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7102287830": {"Name": "Noble D.", "AuthorID": "7102287830", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy, Genetics University of Oxford"}}}
