Eighty-six adolescents 10\u201317 years old were tested using an instructed food versus nonfood cue viewing task (imagine food taste) during high-density EEG recording. Self-report data showed that EE increased with age in girls, but not in boys. Both P3 and LPP amplitudes were greater for food vs. nonfood cues (food-cue bias). Exploratory analyses revealed that, during the LPP time period, greater EE was associated with a more positive food-cue bias in the fronto-central region. This heightened fronto-central food-cue bias LPP is in line with a more activated prefrontal attention system. The results suggest that adolescents with higher EE may engage more top-down cognitive resources to regulate their automatic emotional response to food cues, and/or they may exhibit greater reward network activation to food cues than do adolescents with lower EE, even in the absence of an emotional mood induction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Emotional eating", "Event-related potentials", "Food-cue processing", "Late positive potential"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attention", "Child", "Cues", "Emotions", "Evoked Potentials", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Reward"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033372648", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"]], "AuthorData": {"55557379400": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "55557379400", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale Child Study Center, Yale School of Medicine"}, "56215774000": {"Name": "Willner C.", "AuthorID": "56215774000", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale Child Study Center, Yale School of Medicine"}, "7006290250": {"Name": "Mayes L.", "AuthorID": "7006290250", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale Child Study Center, Yale School of Medicine"}, "7103054032": {"Name": "Crowley M.", "AuthorID": "7103054032", "AffiliationID": "60015278, 60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale Child Study Center, Yale School of Medicine"}, "16150561900": {"Name": "Hill C.", "AuthorID": "16150561900", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology & Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading"}, "7003273958": {"Name": "Fearon P.", "AuthorID": "7003273958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
