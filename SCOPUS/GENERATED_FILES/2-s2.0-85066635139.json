Methods: A cross-sectional medication chart review was conducted at a UK paediatric hospital. Proposed administration dose volumes were calculated for prescribed doses using available manufactured liquids measured with oral and intravenous syringes. Resulting percentage deviations in doses administered were calculated. Results: Of 2031 doses observed, 524 (25.8%) required rounding. The majority of which were for children aged 1\u201312 months. Twenty-seven rounded doses deviated from the prescribed dose by more than 10%. Conclusion: This study highlights the impact of dose-rounding in paediatrics and the need for standardisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "dose-rounding", "paediatric dosing", "paediatric practice"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Infant", "Medication Errors", "Pediatrics", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066635139", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"54584268300": {"Name": "Rashed A.N.", "AuthorID": "54584268300", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55404681700": {"Name": "Tomlin S.", "AuthorID": "55404681700", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7801622768": {"Name": "Arenas-L\u00f3pez S.", "AuthorID": "7801622768", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital, Guy\u2019s & St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602548396": {"Name": "Cavell G.", "AuthorID": "6602548396", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507777030": {"Name": "Whittlesea C.", "AuthorID": "6507777030", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department & Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
