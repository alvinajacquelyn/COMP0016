For such bodies, the environments are characterized by complex interaction among the space plasma, tenuous neutral gas, dust and the outermost layer of the surface. Here we propose the SELMA mission (Surface, Environment, and Lunar Magnetic Anomalies) to study how airless bodies interact with space environment. SELMA uses a unique combination of remote sensing via ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths, and energetic neutral atom imaging, as well as in situ measurements of exospheric gas, plasma, and dust at the Moon. After observations in a lunar orbit for one year, SELMA will conduct an impact experiment to investigate volatile content in the soil of the permanently shadowed area of the Shackleton crater. SELMA also carries an impact probe to sound the Reiner-Gamma mini-magnetosphere and its interaction with the lunar regolith from the SELMA orbit down to the surface. SELMA was proposed to the European Space Agency as a medium-class mission (M5) in October 2016. Research on the SELMA scientific themes is of importance for fundamental planetary sciences and for our general understanding of how the Solar System works. In addition, SELMA outcomes will contribute to future lunar explorations through qualitative characterization of the lunar environment and, in particular, investigation of the presence of water in the lunar soil, as a valuable resource to harvest from the lunar regolith.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dust", "Mini-magnetosphere", "Moon exploration", "Permanently shadowed crater", "Volatile", "Water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energetic neutral atom imaging", "European Space Agency", "Lunar magnetic anomalies", "Mini magnetospheres", "Moon exploration", "Permanently shadowed crater", "Qualitative characterization", "Volatile"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035108097", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"13606959300": {"Name": "Futaana Y.", "AuthorID": "13606959300", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "8763143900": {"Name": "Barabash S.", "AuthorID": "8763143900", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "8267100000": {"Name": "Wieser M.", "AuthorID": "8267100000", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "7003417038": {"Name": "Wurz P.", "AuthorID": "7003417038", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "University of Bern"}, "35794545900": {"Name": "Hurley D.", "AuthorID": "35794545900", "AffiliationID": "60022054", "AffiliationName": "The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"}, "7004420623": {"Name": "Hor\u00e1nyi M.", "AuthorID": "7004420623", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, University of Colorado"}, "6701550722": {"Name": "Mall U.", "AuthorID": "6701550722", "AffiliationID": "60017695", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research"}, "57062143400": {"Name": "Andre N.", "AuthorID": "57062143400", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60123782, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "IRAP- Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CNRS"}, "7003527821": {"Name": "Ivchenko N.", "AuthorID": "7003527821", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology"}, "7003430471": {"Name": "Oberst J.", "AuthorID": "7003430471", "AffiliationID": "60007798", "AffiliationName": "German Aerospace Center"}, "6507370514": {"Name": "Retherford K.", "AuthorID": "6507370514", "AffiliationID": "60011533", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Research Institute"}, "7103145751": {"Name": "Coates A.", "AuthorID": "7103145751", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "23071073500": {"Name": "Masters A.", "AuthorID": "23071073500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "6602486926": {"Name": "Wahlund J.E.", "AuthorID": "6602486926", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "8454153300": {"Name": "Kallio E.", "AuthorID": "8454153300", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Aalto University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
