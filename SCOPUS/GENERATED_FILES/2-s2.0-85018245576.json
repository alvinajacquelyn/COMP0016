This includes brain atrophy, beta amyloid deposition, cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease\u2014factors indicative of brain aging. Here, we employed a machine learning approach, using structural neuroimaging data to predict age (i.e., brain-predicted age) in people with DS (N = 46) and typically developing controls (N = 30). Chronological age was then subtracted from brain-predicted age to generate a brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) score. DS participants also underwent [11C]-PiB positron emission tomography (PET) scans to index the levels of cerebral beta amyloid deposition, and cognitive assessment. Mean brain-PAD in DS participants\u2019 was +2.49 years, significantly greater than controls (p < 0.001). The variability in brain-PAD was associated with the presence and the magnitude of PiB-binding and levels of cognitive performance. Our study indicates that DS is associated with premature structural brain aging, and that age-related alterations in brain structure are associated with individual differences in the rate of beta amyloid deposition and cognitive impairment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid PET", "Brain aging", "Cognitive decline", "Down syndrome", "Machine learning", "MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Brain", "Cognition", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuroimaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018245576", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"7403376270": {"Name": "Cole J.H.", "AuthorID": "7403376270", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Computational, Cognitive & Clinical Neuroimaging Laboratory (C3NL), Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London"}, "57015183500": {"Name": "Annus T.", "AuthorID": "57015183500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57014084500": {"Name": "Wilson L.R.", "AuthorID": "57014084500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "7006571816": {"Name": "Zaman S.H.", "AuthorID": "7006571816", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "55628582579": {"Name": "Holland A.J.", "AuthorID": "55628582579", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge"}, "57194017211": {"Name": "Remtulla R.", "AuthorID": "57194017211", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Medicine School, University of Birmingham"}, "35728820400": {"Name": "Hong Y.T.", "AuthorID": "35728820400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "7004553105": {"Name": "Fryer T.D.", "AuthorID": "7004553105", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "57218001496": {"Name": "Smith R.", "AuthorID": "57218001496", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "8235719600": {"Name": "Acosta-Cabronero J.", "AuthorID": "8235719600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "6508147821": {"Name": "Cardenas-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "6508147821", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "57189881899": {"Name": "Nestor P.J.", "AuthorID": "57189881899", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "7101687199": {"Name": "Menon D.K.", "AuthorID": "7101687199", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Anaesthesia, Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
