A La-Sr/CaO catalyst was studied operando during the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) reaction using the X-ray diffraction computed tomography technique. Full-pattern Rietveld analysis was performed in order to track the evolving solid-state chemistry during the temperature ramp, OCM reaction, as well as after cooling to room temperature. We observed a uniform distribution of the catalyst main components: La 2 O 3 , CaO-SrO mixed oxide, and the high-temperature rhombohedral polymorph of SrCO 3 . These were stable initially in the reaction; however, doubling the gas hourly space velocity resulted in the decomposition of SrCO 3 to SrO, which subsequently led to the formation of a second CaO-SrO mixed oxide. These two mixed CaO-SrO oxides differed in terms of the extent of Sr incorporation into their unit cell. By applying Vegard's law during the Rietveld refinement, it was possible to create maps showing the spatial variation of Sr occupancy in the mixed CaO-SrO oxides. The formation of the Sr-doped CaO species is expected to have an important role in this system through the enhancement of the lattice oxygen diffusion as well as increased catalyst basicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffraction imaging", "Gas hourly space velocities", "High temperature", "Oxidative coupling of methane", "Oxidative coupling of methanes (OCM)", "Solid state chemistry", "Spatial variations", "Uniform distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060518434", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57200512487": {"Name": "Matras D.", "AuthorID": "57200512487", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7004706423": {"Name": "Cernik R.J.", "AuthorID": "7004706423", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7101952456": {"Name": "Jacques S.D.M.", "AuthorID": "7101952456", "AffiliationID": "60170282", "AffiliationName": "Finden Limited, Merchant House"}, "56743361600": {"Name": "Vamvakeros A.", "AuthorID": "56743361600", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "ESRF, European Synchrotron"}, "7003658017": {"Name": "Poulston S.", "AuthorID": "7003658017", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "57212140278": {"Name": "Grosjean N.", "AuthorID": "57212140278", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "57193540951": {"Name": "Estruch Bosch C.", "AuthorID": "57193540951", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "57212662210": {"Name": "Rollins B.", "AuthorID": "57212662210", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre"}, "55627796600": {"Name": "Wright J.", "AuthorID": "55627796600", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "ESRF, European Synchrotron"}, "6603792904": {"Name": "Di Michiel M.", "AuthorID": "6603792904", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "ESRF, European Synchrotron"}}}
