Orthop.", "Volume": "41", "Issue": 12, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 2495, "PageEnd": 2501, "CitedBy": 5, "DOI": "10.1007/s00264-017-3523-1", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020114378&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017, The Author(s).Purpose: We aimed to assess polyethylene liners of retrieved hips of one design of a dual mobility (DM) cup liner and two designs of femoral stems to better understand the role of femoral stem design on polyethylene impingement. Methods: This was a case-control study involving 70 retrieved highly cross-linked polyethylene (X3) liners used with ABGII (n = 35) and Rejuvenate (n = 35) stems (Stryker). All polyethylene liners were assessed for evidence of rim deformation and the damage quantified using metrology methods. Results: A total of 80% of polyethylene liners paired with ABGII necks had macroscopic evidence of neck impingement resulting in a raised lip whilst 23% of liners paired with Rejuvenate necks had evidence of a raised lip (p < 0.0001). The height of the raised rims of the DM cups paired with ABGII necks had a median (range) of 139 \u03bcm (72\u2013255). The height of the raised rims of the DM cups paired with Rejuvenate necks had a median (range) of 52 \u03bcm (45\u201390) (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our new findings from retrieved dual mobility bearings showed that polyethylene liner rim deformation resulting from impingement with the femoral neck occurs in early in-human function, is circumferential in distribution, and is affected by the stem neck design. We recommend the use of highly polished and non-edged neck designs when used in conjunction with DM cups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dual mobility cups", "Intraprosthetic dislocation", "Polyethylene impingement", "Retrievals", "Total hip arthroplasty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Hip Joint", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polyethylene", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Failure", "Time Factors", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020114378", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56974476700": {"Name": "Di Laura A.", "AuthorID": "56974476700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.S.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57192315916": {"Name": "Cerquiglini A.", "AuthorID": "57192315916", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "26647585300": {"Name": "Liow M.H.L.", "AuthorID": "26647585300", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital/ Harvard Medical School"}, "56287339800": {"Name": "Kwon Y.M.", "AuthorID": "56287339800", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital/ Harvard Medical School"}}}
