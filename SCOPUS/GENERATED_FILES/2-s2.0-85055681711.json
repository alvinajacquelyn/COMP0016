Morphological, structural, and composition analysis revealed that our method is effective for growing WO3 nanoneedles decorated with silver/silver oxide nanoparticles at relatively low temperature (\u2264375 \u00b0C) onto sensor arrays printed on an alumina substrate. The sensors were tested for oxygen under humid environment (relative humidity 85%) with the concentration ranging between 0% and 20%. Gas sensing results showed a good response to oxygen with optimum temperature which was observed at 400 \u00b0C for undecorated WO3 and at 350 \u00b0C for silver/silver oxide decorated WO3. The addition of silver/silver oxide was found to improve the sensor response by almost 300%, making the sensor a potential alternative to replace an existing Pb-based oxygen sensor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemical sensor", "heterojunction", "oxygen detection", "silver oxide", "thin film sensor", "tungsten oxide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Composition analysis", "Optimum temperature", "Oxide nanoparticles", "Oxygen measurements", "Sensitive materials", "Thin film sensors", "Tungsten oxide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055681711", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201320962": {"Name": "Sari W.", "AuthorID": "57201320962", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "7005284700": {"Name": "Covington J.", "AuthorID": "7005284700", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57201316833": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "57201316833", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
