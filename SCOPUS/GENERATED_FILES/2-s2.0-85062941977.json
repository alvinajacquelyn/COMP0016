The Negative Effects Questionnaire (NEQ) has previously been developed as a way of determining the occurrence and characteristics of such incidents, consisting of 32 items and six factors. However, the NEQ has yet to be examined using modern test theory, which could help to improve the understanding of how well the instrument works psychometrically. Aims: The current study investigated the reliability and validity of the NEQ from both a person and item perspective, establishing goodness-of-fit, item bias, and scale precision. Method: The NEQ was distributed to 564 patients in five clinical trials at post-treatment. Data were analysed using Rasch analysis, i.e. a modern test theory application. Results: (1) the NEQ exhibits fairness in testing across sociodemographics, (2) shows comparable validity for a final and condensed scale of 20 instead of 32 items, (3) uses a rating scale that advances monotonically in steps of 0 to 4, and (4) is suitable for monitoring negative effects on an item-level. Conclusions: The NEQ is proposed as a useful instrument for investigating negative effects in psychological treatments, and its newer shorter format could facilitate its use in clinical and research settings. However, further research is needed to explore the relationship between negative effects and treatment outcome, as well as to test it in more diverse patient populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["negative effects", "Negative Effects Questionnaire", "psychological treatments", "Rasch analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Negative Results", "Psychology", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Treatment Failure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062941977", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"55933429800": {"Name": "Rozental A.", "AuthorID": "55933429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55432801800": {"Name": "M\u00e5nsson K.", "AuthorID": "55432801800", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Uppsala University"}, "7202645907": {"Name": "Andersson G.", "AuthorID": "7202645907", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "6506079508": {"Name": "Kottorp A.", "AuthorID": "6506079508", "AffiliationID": "60007905", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Society, Malm\u00f6 University"}, "55431031300": {"Name": "Forsstr\u00f6m D.", "AuthorID": "55431031300", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Stockholm University"}, "6603291354": {"Name": "Carlbring P.", "AuthorID": "6603291354", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Southern Denmark"}, "55954246500": {"Name": "Furmark T.", "AuthorID": "55954246500", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Uppsala University"}, "40461015400": {"Name": "Boettcher J.", "AuthorID": "40461015400", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}}}
