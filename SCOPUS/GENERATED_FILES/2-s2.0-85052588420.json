Uniquely, \u03b3-herpesvirus UNGs carry a seven or eight residue insertion of variable sequence in the otherwise highly conserved minor-groove DNA binding loop. In Epstein-Barr Virus [HHV-4] UNG, this motif forms a disc-shaped loop structure of unclear significance. To ascertain the biological role of the loop insertion, we determined the crystal structure of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [HHV- 8] UNG (kUNG) in its product complex with a uracilcontaining dsDNA, as well as two structures of kUNG in its apo state. We find the disc-like conformation is conserved, but only when the kUNG DNA-binding cleft is occupied. Surprisingly, kUNG uses this structure to flip the orphaned partner base of the substrate deoxyuridine out of the DNA duplex while retaining canonical UNG deoxyuridine-flipping and catalysis. The orphan base is stably posed in the DNA major groove which, due to DNA backbone manipulation by kUNG, is more open than in other UNG-dsDNA structures. Mutagenesis suggests a model in which the kUNG loop is pinned outside the DNA-binding cleft until DNA docking promotes rigid structuring of the loop and duplex nucleotide flipping, a novel observation for UNGs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Motifs", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Conserved Sequence", "DNA", "Herpesvirus 4, Human", "Herpesvirus 8, Human", "Models, Molecular", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Nucleotides", "Uracil-DNA Glycosidase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052588420", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56906048600": {"Name": "Earl C.", "AuthorID": "56906048600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "8404736800": {"Name": "Bagn\u00e9ris C.", "AuthorID": "8404736800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57203662911": {"Name": "Zeman K.", "AuthorID": "57203662911", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7201573921": {"Name": "Cole A.", "AuthorID": "7201573921", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "7202538434": {"Name": "Barrett T.", "AuthorID": "7202538434", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "6602535638": {"Name": "Savva R.", "AuthorID": "6602535638", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
