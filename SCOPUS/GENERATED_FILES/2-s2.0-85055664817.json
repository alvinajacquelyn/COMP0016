Following the results of the multicentre European retrospective \u201cTimeToStop\u201d cohort study, we initiated a randomised trial to determine cognitive benefits of early postoperative antiepileptic drug withdrawal. Unfortunately, the trial failed to recruit and was terminated, as almost all parents preferred early drug withdrawal. The objectives of the current survey were to obtain insight into current practices regarding drug withdrawal after paediatric epilepsy surgery among epileptologists, and better understand the reasons for difficulties in recruitment. Methods. A survey was sent to three international epilepsy surgery networks, questioning drug withdrawal policies. Forty-seven (19%) surveys were returned. Results. For polytherapy, withdrawal was started at a median of three and six months by the TimeToStop collaborators and other paediatric epileptologists, respectively. Withdrawal was completed at a median of 12 and 20 months, respectively. For monotherapy, tapering was initiated at five and 11 months in these two groups, and ended at a median of seven and 12 months, respectively. Most TimeToStop collaborators believed that it was not justified to wait 12 months after surgery before reducing AEDs, regardless of the number of AEDs taken. Conclusion. Current AED policies in Europe have changed as a consequence of the retrospective TimeToStop results, and this accounts for why recruitment in a randomised trial was not feasible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anticonvulsive medication", "children", "discontinuation", "epilepsy surgery", "epileptologist"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anticonvulsants", "Child", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Epilepsy", "Europe", "Humans", "Patient Selection", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055664817", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56584610100": {"Name": "Lamberink H.J.", "AuthorID": "56584610100", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Neurology, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Member of the European Reference Network EpiCARE"}, "56635065000": {"Name": "Geleijns K.", "AuthorID": "56635065000", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Neurology, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Member of the European Reference Network EpiCARE"}, "6701476663": {"Name": "Otte W.M.", "AuthorID": "6701476663", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical MR Imaging and Spectroscopy Group, Center for Image Sciences, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University"}, "55598771200": {"Name": "Braun K.P.J.", "AuthorID": "55598771200", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child Neurology, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht and Utrecht University, Member of the European Reference Network EpiCARE"}, "7003564550": {"Name": "Arzimanoglou A.", "AuthorID": "7003564550", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Universitat de Barcelona, Hospital San Juan de Deu Epilepsy Unit, Member of the European Reference Network EpiCARE"}, "26023170400": {"Name": "Helen Cross J.", "AuthorID": "26023170400", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60112913, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences, UCL-Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Coordination of the European Reference Network EpiCARE, London & Young Epilepsy"}, "57192947118": {"Name": "Korff C.M.", "AuthorID": "57192947118", "AffiliationID": "60009963", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de Neurop\u00e9diatrie, H\u00f4pitaux Universitaries de Gen\u00e8ve"}, "12793981600": {"Name": "Ramantani G.", "AuthorID": "12793981600", "AffiliationID": "60002695", "AffiliationName": "Neuropediatrics, University Children's Hospital Z\u00fcrich"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
