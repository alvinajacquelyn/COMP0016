To address the genetic contribution of CHCHD10 to ALS, we have screened a cohort of 425 UK ALS \u00b1 frontotemporal dementia patients and 576 local controls in all coding exons of CHCHD10 by Sanger sequencing. We identified a previously reported p.P34S variant that is also present in neurologically healthy controls (p = 0.58). Our results suggest that CHCHD10 is not a primary cause of ALS in UK cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALS", "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "CHCHD10", "Genetics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Cohort Studies", "Exons", "Female", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Variation", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Male", "Mitochondrial Proteins", "Open Reading Frames", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940938986", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57213837768": {"Name": "Wong C.H.", "AuthorID": "57213837768", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "15046032500": {"Name": "Topp S.", "AuthorID": "15046032500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55328923700": {"Name": "Gkazi A.S.", "AuthorID": "55328923700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7801372409": {"Name": "Troakes C.", "AuthorID": "7801372409", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55245798500": {"Name": "Miller J.W.", "AuthorID": "55245798500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56820094900": {"Name": "de Majo M.", "AuthorID": "56820094900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "23986704100": {"Name": "Vance C.A.", "AuthorID": "23986704100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003751621": {"Name": "Al-Chalabi A.", "AuthorID": "7003751621", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57203252040": {"Name": "Al-Sarraj S.", "AuthorID": "57203252040", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "35370282000": {"Name": "Shaw C.E.", "AuthorID": "35370282000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7501692057": {"Name": "Smith B.N.", "AuthorID": "7501692057", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "8927793400": {"Name": "Kirby J.", "AuthorID": "8927793400", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), University of Sheffield"}, "7401650160": {"Name": "Shaw P.J.", "AuthorID": "7401650160", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), University of Sheffield"}, "57188987558": {"Name": "Morrison K.E.", "AuthorID": "57188987558", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "7004307763": {"Name": "de Belleroche J.", "AuthorID": "7004307763", "AffiliationID": "60020416", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Group, Division of Brain Sciences, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}}}
