The aim of the study is to review nutritional outcomes, complications and the practical consideration to enable patients and carers to make informed choice. Methods: Retrospective review of patient notes with a RGJ or SJ in 2010, with detailed follow-up and review of the literature. Results: Both RGJ and SJ are reliable modes to provide stable enteral nutrition. Both have complications and their own associated limitations. Conclusions: The choice has to be tailored to the individual patient, the social care available, the inherent medical disease and risk/benefit of repeated anaesthetic and radiation exposure. RGJ and SJ are important tools for nutritional management that achieve and maintain growth in a complex group of children. The risk and benefits should be reviewed for each individual patient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gastro-jejunostomy tube", "Jejunostomy", "Nutritional outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Nutrition Disorders", "Child, Preschool", "Enteral Nutrition", "Female", "Gastrostomy", "Growth Disorders", "Humans", "Infant", "Jejunostomy", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049934022", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"7408184180": {"Name": "Singh R.R.", "AuthorID": "7408184180", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "42560973700": {"Name": "Cross K.M.K.", "AuthorID": "42560973700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57198123285": {"Name": "Curry J.I.", "AuthorID": "57198123285", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Surgery, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7006174234": {"Name": "Roebuck D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006174234", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "9246603500": {"Name": "Barnacle A.M.", "AuthorID": "9246603500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "23088404600": {"Name": "Chippington S.", "AuthorID": "23088404600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
