All rights reserved.Psychologists tend to focus on individual difference factors when examining why some people flourish and others suffer from physical or psychological health problems. This chapter argues that women\u2019s well-being is profoundly influenced by social structures (policies, laws, cultural practices) that infringe on their human rights. These structures create damaging social conditions, encompassing several forms of discrimination (such as workplace harassment and incivilities, and sexual and self-objectification) that may occur in overt or subtle ways. Such discrimination limits women\u2019s abilities to achieve well-being and positive enjoyment of life (life satisfaction and \u201ceudaemonic well-being\u201d). Women\u2019s gendered experiences of discrimination are shaped by the other social identities they hold (e.g., race, class, sexual orientation), further complicating the discrimination-health relationship. Framing such gendered discrimination as a violation of women\u2019s human rights will help psychologists and policy makers argue that discrimination is a social justice issue and identify practices that eliminate mistreatment at its roots.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gender", "Human rights", "Mental health", "Physical health", "Social justice", "Well-being", "Women"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060498606", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"35561011800": {"Name": "Stewart A.", "AuthorID": "35561011800", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Women\u2019s Studies, University of Michigan"}, "7006878111": {"Name": "Zucker A.", "AuthorID": "7006878111", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Center for Gender, Sexualities, and Women\u2019s Studies Research, University of Florida"}}}
