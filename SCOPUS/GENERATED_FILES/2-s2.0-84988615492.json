All rights reserved.Objective: To evaluate whether cotrimoxazole prophylaxis prevents common skin conditions in HIV-infected children. Design: Open-label randomized controlled trial of continuing versus stopping daily cotrimoxazole (post-hoc analysis). Setting: Three sites in Uganda and one in Zimbabwe. Participants: A total of 758 children aged more than 3 years receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for more than 96 weeks in the ARROW trial were randomized to stop (n=382) or continue (n=376) cotrimoxazole after median (interquartile range) 2.1(1.8, 2.2) years on ART. Intervention: Continuing versus stopping daily cotrimoxazole. Main outcome measures: Nurses screened for signs/symptoms at 6-week visits. This was a secondary analysis of ARROW trial data, with skin complaints categorized blind to randomization as bacterial, fungal, or viral infections; dermatitis; pruritic papular eruptions (PPEs); or others (blisters, desquamation, ulcers, and urticaria). Proportions ever reporting each skin complaint were compared across randomized groups using logistic regression. Results: At randomization, median (interquartile range) age was 7 (4, 11) years and CD4+ was 33% (26, 39); 73% had WHO stage 3/4 disease. Fewer children continuing cotrimoxazole reported bacterial skin infections over median 2 years follow-up (15 versus 33%, respectively; P<0.001), with similar trends for PPE (P=0.06) and other skin complaints (P=0.11), but not for fungal (P=0.45) or viral (P=0.23) infections or dermatitis (P=1.0). Bacterial skin infections were also reported at significantly fewer clinic visits (1.2 versus 3.0%, P<0.001). Independent of cotrimoxazole, bacterial skin infections were more common in children aged 6-8 years, with current CD4+ cell count less than 500 cells/ml, WHO stage 3/4, less time on ART, and lower socioeconomic status. Conclusion: Long-term cotrimoxazole prophylaxis reduces common skin complaints, highlighting an additional benefit for long-term prophylaxis in sub-Saharan Africa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacteria", "Children", "Cotrimoxazole", "HIV", "Skin infections", "Sub-Saharan Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Antibiotic Prophylaxis", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Skin Diseases, Bacterial", "Treatment Outcome", "Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination", "Uganda", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988615492", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"15760719100": {"Name": "Prendergast A.J.", "AuthorID": "15760719100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "9735572400": {"Name": "Thomason M.J.", "AuthorID": "9735572400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "35402208300": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "35402208300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "36670936700": {"Name": "Bwakura-Dangarembizi M.", "AuthorID": "36670936700", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe"}, "6603691631": {"Name": "Mugyenyi P.", "AuthorID": "6603691631", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "36990168800": {"Name": "Lutaakome J.", "AuthorID": "36990168800", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Uganda Virus Research Institute Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "21934132800": {"Name": "Kekitiinwa A.", "AuthorID": "21934132800", "AffiliationID": "60071696", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Clinic/Baylor - Uganda, Mulago Hospital"}}}
