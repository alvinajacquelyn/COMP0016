However, given the physical constraints of the imaging instruments themselves, one needs to be able to trade-off spatial resolution against launch mass as well as telecommunications bandwidth for transmitting data back to the Earth. In this paper, we present a newly developed super-resolution restoration system, called MAGiGAN, based on our original GPT-SRR system combined with deep learning image networks to be able to restore up to 4x higher resolution enhancement using multi-angle repeat images as input.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep learning", "Earth observation", "Generative adversarial network", "MAGiGAN", "Multi-angle", "Super-resolution restoration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adversarial networks", "Earth observations", "MAGiGAN", "Multi angle", "Super-resolution restoration"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059024601", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56539197700": {"Name": "Tao Y.", "AuthorID": "56539197700", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7404871794": {"Name": "Muller J.P.", "AuthorID": "7404871794", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
