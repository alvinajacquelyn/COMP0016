We derive and solve the wave equation that governs prebuckling torsion dynamics and highlight the compatibility problem between initial and boundary conditions (corner singularity) plaguing numerical solution of the equation. We deal with this problem by introducing a smoothing function. Prebuckling torque oscillations are a major concern in various turbine applications. Torsional instability, upon further increase of the applied moment, is found to be delayed by the dynamic loading. We determine the dependence of the critical load on the rate of application of the moment by computing initial postbuckling solutions and extrapolating back to the critical point. For these computations we use the geometrically-exact Cosserat rod equations, which we discretise with the generalised-\u03b1 method. We argue that in addition to inertia a gyroscopic effect may play a role in the delay. Our results may help explain delayed torsional buckling recently observed in simulation studies of flexible marine risers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corner singularity", "Cosserat rod", "Delay of buckling", "Torsional buckling", "Torsional wave"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compatibility problems", "Corner singularity", "Cosserat rod", "Geometrically exact", "Initial and boundary conditions", "Numerical solution", "Torsional buckling", "Turbine applications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054877013", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56170335400": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "56170335400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7005973659": {"Name": "van der Heijden G.", "AuthorID": "7005973659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
