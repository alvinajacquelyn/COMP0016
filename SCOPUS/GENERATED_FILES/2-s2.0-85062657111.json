A potential contributing cause of underestimation of 68 Ga SUV is overestimation of 68 Ga activity in the Radionuclide Calibrator associated with the PET/CT scanner. To investigate this, a Radionuclide Calibrator cross-calibration exercise was performed. Methods: A source of 68 Ga was measured in 5 Capintec CRC-55tR calibrators using the pre-set 68 Ga calibrator factor of 416, and a Veenstra VDC-505 calibrator using a factor recommended by the manufacturer. The source was then measured in an externally located Fidelis Secondary Standard Radionuclide Calibrator. Manual adjustments were made to the Capintec calibrator factors to match the decay corrected Fidelis measurement, followed by a repeat PET/CT scan of a uniform 68 Ga phantom. Results: The cross-calibration results showed that the 5 Capintec calibrators systematically overestimated 68 Ga activity by 7.8\u20139.4% (mean 8.5%) compared to the Fidelis. The calibrator factors were adjusted to 456\u2013464 to match the Fidelis measurement, and the repeat phantom scan resulted in a SUV mean of 0.97, within the local tolerance of 1.00 \u00b1 5%. The result for the Veenstra calibrator was within the tolerance of \u00b15%. Conclusions: Underestimation of 68 Ga SUV was primarily caused by overestimation of 68 Ga activity using the pre-set calibrator factor setting on a Capintec CRC-55tR. Improvement in quantification accuracy was achieved by adjusting the 68 Ga calibrator factor based upon a cross-calibration exercise. We recommend SUV checks using a uniform phantom and regular calibrator cross-calibration exercises for all isotopes used for quantitative PET/CT imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["68 Ga", "Calibration", "PET", "SUV"], "IndexKeywords": ["Calibration", "Gallium Radioisotopes", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062657111", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57207618402": {"Name": "Sanderson T.", "AuthorID": "57207618402", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8960246600": {"Name": "Dickson J.", "AuthorID": "8960246600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57207617164": {"Name": "Solomon J.", "AuthorID": "57207617164", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57207620980": {"Name": "Nottage C.", "AuthorID": "57207620980", "AffiliationID": "60171758", "AffiliationName": "Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
