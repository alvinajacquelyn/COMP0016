Herein, we compare and contrast properties associated with guest binding by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations using nine different functionals for the M2(dobdc) (dobdc4- = 2,5-dioxido,1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) series, where M = Mg, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. Additionally, we perform Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations for one system to determine if this method can be used to assess the performance of DFT. We also make comparisons with previously published experimental results for carbon dioxide and water and present new methane neutron powder diffraction (NPD) data for further comparison. All of the functionals are able to predict the experimental variation in the binding energy from one metal to the next; however, the interpretation of the performance of the functionals depends on which value is taken as the reference. On the one hand, if we compare against experimental values, we would conclude that the optB86b-vdW and optB88-vdW functionals systematically overestimate the binding strength, while the second generation of van der Waals (vdW) nonlocal functionals (vdw-DF2 and rev-vdW-DF2) correct for this providing a good description of binding energies. On the other hand, if the QMC calculation is taken as the reference then all of the nonlocal functionals yield results that fall just outside the error of the higher-level calculation. The empirically corrected vdW functionals are in reasonable agreement with experimental heat of adsorptions but under bind when compared with QMC, while Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof fails by more than 20 kJ/mol regardless of which reference is employed. All of the functionals, with the exception of vdW-DF2, predict reasonable framework and guest binding geometries when compared with NPD measurements. The newest of the functionals considered, rev-vdW-DF2, should be used in place of vdW-DF2, as it yields improved bond distances with similar quality binding energies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental values", "Heat of adsorption", "Metal organic framework", "Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs)", "Nonlocal functionals", "Perdew-burke-ernzerhof", "Quantum Monte Carlo calculations", "Small-molecule bindings"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020433300", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"25626992200": {"Name": "Vlaisavljevich B.", "AuthorID": "25626992200", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California"}, "56416161200": {"Name": "Huck J.", "AuthorID": "56416161200", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of California"}, "7403447252": {"Name": "Long J.R.", "AuthorID": "7403447252", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "7102999528": {"Name": "Smit B.", "AuthorID": "7102999528", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Institut des Sciences et Ing\u00e9nierie Chimiques, Valais, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "45161566300": {"Name": "Mason J.A.", "AuthorID": "45161566300", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of California"}, "7006720133": {"Name": "Neaton J.B.", "AuthorID": "7006720133", "AffiliationID": "114180331", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Energy Nanosciences Institute at Berkeley"}, "8285758800": {"Name": "Hulvey Z.", "AuthorID": "8285758800", "AffiliationID": "60078684, 60020304", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Maryland"}, "57203599479": {"Name": "Brown C.M.", "AuthorID": "57203599479", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Delaware"}, "55737427600": {"Name": "Lee K.", "AuthorID": "55737427600", "AffiliationID": "101867773", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Foundry"}, "7004035504": {"Name": "Alf\u00e8 D.", "AuthorID": "7004035504", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}}}
