The 13-dimensional model potential energy surface was obtained from Hartree Fock energies with the 6-31G\u2217 basis set and the expectation value of the flux operator along the transition mode was used as a benchmark characteristic. As well as showing excellent convergence of the vMCG method on the model surface using a local harmonic approximation and a moderate number of basis functions, we show that the direct dynamics version of the vMCG also performs very well, usually needs the same number of Gaussians to converge, and converges to exact results if those are obtained on an accurately fitted surface. Finally, we make an important observation that the width of the Gaussian basis functions must be chosen very carefully to obtain accurate results with the use of the frozen-width approximation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Expectation values", "Gaussian basis functions", "Hartree-Fock energies", "Intramolecular proton transfer", "Local harmonic approximation", "Multiconfiguration", "Quantum dynamics", "Quantum dynamics simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940486235", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57205033745": {"Name": "Polyak I.", "AuthorID": "57205033745", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "24779595300": {"Name": "Allan C.", "AuthorID": "24779595300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "7006625328": {"Name": "Worth G.", "AuthorID": "7006625328", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}}}
