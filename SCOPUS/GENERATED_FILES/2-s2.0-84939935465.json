We report the natural history of a large multicentre cohort of such children. Methods: We reviewed case notes from three different UK centres to determine the clinical course of 34 patients (16 female, 18 male) with childhood-onset mitochondrial disease caused by SLSMDs. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis was used to compare survival of patients presenting with haematological features (Pearson syndrome) and those with nonhaematological presentations. Results: The most frequent initial presentation was with isolated ptosis (16/34, 47 %). Eleven (32 %) patients presented with transfusion-dependent anaemia soon after birth and were diagnosed with Pearson syndrome, whilst ten were classified as having Kearns\u2013Sayre syndrome, three as having progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) and seven as having PEO-plus. Three patients did not conform to any specific mitochondrial syndrome. The most frequently affected organ during the disease course was the kidney, with documented tubular or glomerular dysfunction in 17 of 20 (85 %) cases who had detailed investigations. SLSMDs were present in blood and/or urine cells in all cases tested, indicating that muscle biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis in the paediatric age range. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis revealed significantly worse mortality in patients with Pearson syndrome compared with the rest of the cohort. Conclusions: Mitochondrial disease caused by SLSMDs is clinically heterogeneous, and not all cases conform to a classical mitochondrial syndrome. Multisystem disease is the norm, with anaemia, renal impairment and endocrine disturbance being the most frequent extraneurological features. SLSMDs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all children presenting with ptosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase, Long-Chain", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Blepharoptosis", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "DNA, Mitochondrial", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Kearns-Sayre Syndrome", "Lipid Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Male", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Muscular Diseases", "Sequence Deletion", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939935465", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"35602576700": {"Name": "Broomfield A.", "AuthorID": "35602576700", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "Genetic Medicine, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation trust, St Mary\u2019s Hospital"}, "57213247039": {"Name": "Morris A.M.", "AuthorID": "57213247039", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "Genetic Medicine, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation trust, St Mary\u2019s Hospital"}, "7201380026": {"Name": "Sweeney M.G.", "AuthorID": "7201380026", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}, "16944908200": {"Name": "Woodward C.E.", "AuthorID": "16944908200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery"}, "24480902700": {"Name": "Fratter C.", "AuthorID": "24480902700", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Medical Genetics Laboratories, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, The Churchill Hospital"}, "8964724800": {"Name": "Leonard J.V.", "AuthorID": "8964724800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8598469800": {"Name": "Abulhoul L.", "AuthorID": "8598469800", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Metabolic Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Institute of Child Health"}, "7005299518": {"Name": "Grunewald S.", "AuthorID": "7005299518", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "35400640400": {"Name": "Rahman S.", "AuthorID": "35400640400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60105834", "AffiliationName": "Mitochondrial Research Group, Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.T.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.G.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "35476433300": {"Name": "Poulton J.", "AuthorID": "35476433300", "AffiliationID": "60008323", "AffiliationName": "NDOG, Level 3, Women\u2019s Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital"}}}
