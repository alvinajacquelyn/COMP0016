Since many policing activities require the physical presence of officers, a crucial issue for police effectiveness concerns the extent to which officers are located where they are needed. Operationally, this can be framed as a \u2018supply and demand\u2019 issue, where the aim is to match the supply of police resource to the demand for service. In this paper, we examine this issue for a five-month period in London, UK, using police vehicle tracking data and call-for-service records. We examine the extent to which supply and demand are aligned at the street segment level and build a statistical model which seeks to explain the disparity between the two quantities in terms of network structure. We find that police activity is distributed unevenly, with over-supply on more central streets, and discuss the implications of this for police practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crime", "officer tracking", "policing", "street networks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063649047", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55605786800": {"Name": "Davies T.", "AuthorID": "55605786800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "7006388124": {"Name": "Bowers K.", "AuthorID": "7006388124", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
