We show that the FLRW solutions are nonlinearly globally future-stable under small perturbations of their initial data. In our analysis, we construct harmonic-type coordinates such that the cosmological constant results in the presence of dissipative terms in the evolution equations. Our result extends those of [I. Rodnianski and J. Speck, The nonlinear future stability of the FLRW family of solutions to the irrotational Euler-Einstein system with a positive cosmological constant, J. Eur. Math.

Valiente Kroon, A conformal approach for the analysis of the nonlinear stability of pure radiation cosmologies, Ann. Phys. 328 (2013) 1-25], where analogous results were proved for the Euler-Einstein system under the equations of state p = c<sup>2</sup><inf>s</inf>, 0 < c<sup>2</sup><inf>s</inf> \u2264 1/3. The dust-Einstein system is the case c<inf>s</inf> = 0. The main difficulty that we overcome here is that the dust's energy density loses one degree of differentiability compared to the cases 0 < c<sup>2</sup><inf>s</inf> \u2264 1/3, which introduces many obstacles for closing the estimates. To resolve this difficulty, we commute the equations with a well-chosen differential operator and derive elliptic estimates that complement the energy estimates of [I. Rodnianski and J.
