The thermal behaviour predicted for bulk mackinawite is in good agreement with experiment. The adsorption of water on the low-index surfaces of mackinawite reproduces results from density functional theory calculations at different water coverages, while the behaviour of water intercalated into the mineral is also remarkably similar to that from ab initio results. The force field is therefore suitable to model bulk mackinawite and its surfaces in an aqueous environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Force field", "Mackinawite/water interface", "Molecular dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008486079", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"36010172100": {"Name": "Terranova U.", "AuthorID": "36010172100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "de Leeuw N.H.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}}}
