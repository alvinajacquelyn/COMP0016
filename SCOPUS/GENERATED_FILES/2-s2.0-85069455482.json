Methods: Seventeen subjects (age 68 \u00b1 11 years) in the subacute phase (14 \u00b1 3 days post-stroke), 10 of whom rescanned in the chronic phase (231 \u00b1 36 days post-stroke), were enrolled. Images were acquired using a 3-T MRI scanner with a two-shell EPI protocol (20 gradient directions, b = 700 s/mm2, 3 b = 0; 64 gradient directions, b = 2000 s/mm2, 9 b = 0). DTI-, DKI-, and NODDI-derived parameters were calculated in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and in the cerebral peduncle (CP). Results: In the subacute phase, a reduction of FA, AD, and KA values was correlated with an increase of ODI, RD, and AK parameters, in both the ipsilesional PLIC and CP, suggesting that increased fiber dispersion can be the main structural factor. In the chronic phase, a reduction of FA and an increase of ODI persisted in the ipsilesional areas. This was associated with reduced Fic and increased MD, with a concomitant reduction of MK and increase of RD, suggesting that fiber reduction, possibly due to nerve degeneration, could play an important role. Conclusions: This study shows that advanced dMRI approaches can help elucidate the underpinning architectural modifications occurring in the CST after stroke. Further follow-up studies on bigger cohorts are needed to evaluate if DKI- and NODDI-derived parameters might be proposed as complementary biomarkers of brain microstructural alterations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corticospinal tract", "DKI", "DTI", "NODDI", "Subacute and chronic stroke"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069455482", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"36497099000": {"Name": "Mastropietro A.", "AuthorID": "36497099000", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Bioimaging and Physiology, National Research Council"}, "7102724260": {"Name": "Rizzo G.", "AuthorID": "7102724260", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Technologies, National Research Council"}, "56884031000": {"Name": "Fontana L.", "AuthorID": "56884031000", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Unit, Neuro Center, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"}, "6503875468": {"Name": "Nuzzi N.P.", "AuthorID": "6503875468", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Unit, Neuro Center, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"}, "57190184050": {"Name": "Grimaldi M.", "AuthorID": "57190184050", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Unit, Neuro Center, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"}, "55796625500": {"Name": "Figini M.", "AuthorID": "55796625500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7004229305": {"Name": "Bernardini B.", "AuthorID": "7004229305", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Neurorehabilitation Unit, Neuro Center, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"}, "57196469309": {"Name": "Ghirmai S.", "AuthorID": "57196469309", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Neurorehabilitation Unit, Neuro Center, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"}, "35741748600": {"Name": "Straffi L.", "AuthorID": "35741748600", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Unit, Neuro Center, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"}, "6603475175": {"Name": "Marcheselli S.", "AuthorID": "6603475175", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Unit, Neuro Center, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"}, "6603805217": {"Name": "Malosio M.L.", "AuthorID": "6603805217", "AffiliationID": "60024876", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pharmacology and Brain Pathology, Neuro Center, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS"}}}
