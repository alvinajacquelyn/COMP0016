All rights reserved.In order to demonstrate cavity quantum electrodynamics using photonic crystal (PhC) cavities fabricated around self-assembled quantum dots (QDs), reliable spectral and spatial overlap between the cavity mode and the quantum dot is required. We present a method for using photoresist to optically fabricate heterostructure cavities in a PhC waveguide with a combined photolithography and micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy system. The system can identify single QDs with a spatial precision of \u00b125 nm, and we confirm the creation of high quality factor cavity modes deterministically placed with the same spatial precision. This method offers a promising route towards bright, on-chip single photon sources for quantum information applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics", "High-quality-factor cavities", "Microphotoluminescence spectroscopy", "Optical fabrication", "Photonic waveguides", "Quantum information applications", "Self assembled quantum dots", "Single-photon source"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030451316", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57189213183": {"Name": "Nuttall L.", "AuthorID": "57189213183", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "57195957156": {"Name": "Lennon S.", "AuthorID": "57195957156", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "42762036000": {"Name": "Reid B.", "AuthorID": "42762036000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "55547114683": {"Name": "Taylor R.", "AuthorID": "55547114683", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "13605916900": {"Name": "Brossard F.", "AuthorID": "13605916900", "AffiliationID": "60098251, 60003381", "AffiliationName": "Hitachi, Cambridge Laboratory, Hitachi Europe Ltd."}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203312733": {"Name": "Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "57203312733", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
