Methods: Using a search strategy of PubMed, EmBase and CENTRAL, we selected all relevant randomised clinical trials published from January 2000 to January 2015. We translated non-English papers and contacted authors as necessary. Our primary analysis generated a pooled odds ratio (OR) from a fixed-effect model. Sensitivity analyses explored the effect of including non-ED studies, adjusting for study quality, and conducting a random-effects model. Secondary outcomes included organ support and hospital and ICU length of stay. Results: From 2395 initially eligible abstracts, five randomised clinical trials (n = 4735 patients) met all criteria and generally scored high for quality except for lack of blinding. There was no effect on the primary mortality outcome (EGDT: 23.2 % [495/2134] versus control: 22.4 % [582/2601]; pooled OR 1.01 [95 % CI 0.88\u20131.16], P = 0.9, with heterogeneity [I2 = 57 %; P = 0.055]). The pooled estimate of 90-day mortality from the three recent multicentre studies (n = 4063) also showed no difference [pooled OR 0.99 (95 % CI 0.86\u20131.15), P = 0.93] with no heterogeneity (I2 = 0.0 %; P = 0.97). EGDT increased vasopressor use (OR 1.25 [95 % CI 1.10\u20131.41]; P < 0.001) and ICU admission [OR 2.19 (95 % CI 1.82\u20132.65); P < 0.001]. Including six non-ED randomised trials increased heterogeneity (I2 = 71 %; P < 0.001) but did not change overall results [pooled OR 0.94 (95 % CI 0.82 to 1.07); P = 0.33]. Conclusion: EGDT is not superior to usual care for ED patients with septic shock but is associated with increased utilisation of ICU resources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Central venous oxygen saturation", "Early goal-directed therapy or EGDT", "Meta-analysis", "Randomised clinical trials", "Resuscitation", "Septic shock", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical Care", "Early Medical Intervention", "Goals", "Humans", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Shock, Septic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940448659", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"7102124583": {"Name": "Angus D.C.", "AuthorID": "7102124583", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "56408747600": {"Name": "Huang D.T.", "AuthorID": "56408747600", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "7103325757": {"Name": "Kellum J.A.", "AuthorID": "7103325757", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "57057538800": {"Name": "Pike F.", "AuthorID": "57057538800", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "7005470858": {"Name": "Yealy D.M.", "AuthorID": "7005470858", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "57196315994": {"Name": "Barnato A.E.", "AuthorID": "57196315994", "AffiliationID": "60001361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine"}, "57203518317": {"Name": "Bell D.", "AuthorID": "57203518317", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "Department of Acute Medicine, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35447905100": {"Name": "Bellomo R.", "AuthorID": "35447905100", "AffiliationID": "60003292", "AffiliationName": "Austin Hospital"}, "7403658328": {"Name": "Davies A.", "AuthorID": "7403658328", "AffiliationID": "60021498", "AffiliationName": "Frankston Hospital"}, "57203391253": {"Name": "Delaney A.", "AuthorID": "57203391253", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Northern Clinical School, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "57195670644": {"Name": "Howe B.", "AuthorID": "57195670644", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Monash University"}, "6701569211": {"Name": "Iwashyna T.", "AuthorID": "6701569211", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "University of Michigan and VA Centre for Clinical Management Research"}, "56653620800": {"Name": "Peake S.L.", "AuthorID": "56653620800", "AffiliationID": "60000077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Intensive Care Medicine, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "24774575800": {"Name": "Webb S.A.R.", "AuthorID": "24774575800", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60030929", "AffiliationName": "Royal Perth Hospital and University of Western Australia"}, "54908898600": {"Name": "Chong C.R.", "AuthorID": "54908898600", "AffiliationID": "60009512, 60189793", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, University of Adelaide"}, "7005056660": {"Name": "Coats T.J.", "AuthorID": "7005056660", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "35279884900": {"Name": "Harrison D.A.", "AuthorID": "35279884900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7007048381": {"Name": "Rowan K.M.", "AuthorID": "7007048381", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Research Strategy, University College London"}, "6602081482": {"Name": "Holdgate A.", "AuthorID": "6602081482", "AffiliationID": "60028333, 60005506", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool Hospital and University of NSW"}, "6602984423": {"Name": "Reade M.C.", "AuthorID": "6602984423", "AffiliationID": "123625511", "AffiliationName": "Joint Health Command, Australian Defence Force"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University College London"}, "7004114531": {"Name": "Weissfeld L.A.", "AuthorID": "7004114531", "AffiliationID": "60020988", "AffiliationName": "Statistics Collaborative"}, "26030750100": {"Name": "Young J.D.", "AuthorID": "26030750100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Division of Anaesthetics, University of Oxford"}}}
