Square-wave modulations resulted in a larger FMB than sinusoidal ones. FMBs were also larger for high compared to low-predictability sentences, indicating that high sentence predictability increases the benefits from glimpses of the target speech in the dips of the fluctuating masker. In addition, sentence predictability appears to have a greater effect on sentence intelligibility when the masker is fluctuating than when it is steady-state.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Modulation types", "Sentence intelligibility", "Speech reception threshold", "Square wave modulation", "Steady state", "Target speech"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940785173", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"57191919940": {"Name": "Schoof T.", "AuthorID": "57191919940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences"}, "7401609413": {"Name": "Rosen S.", "AuthorID": "7401609413", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences"}}}
