Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.RBM10 is an RNA-binding protein that plays an essential role in development and is frequentlymutated in the context of human disease. RBM10 recognizes a diverse set of RNA motifs in introns and exons and regulates alternative splicing. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this seemingly relaxed sequence specificity are not understood and functional studies have focused on 3 intronic sites only. Here, we dissect the RNA code recognized by RBM10 and relate it to the splicing regulatory function of this protein. We show that a two-domain RRM1-ZnF unit recognizes a GGA-centered motif enriched in RBM10 exonic sites with high affinity and specificity and test that the interaction with these exonic sequences promotes exon skipping. Importantly, a second RRM domain (RRM2) of RBM10 recognizes a C-rich sequence, which explains its known interactionwith the intronic 3' site of NUMB exon 9 contributing to regulation of the Notch pathway in cancer. Together, these findings explain RBM10's broad RNA specificity and suggest that RBM10 functions as a splicing regulator using two RNA-binding units with different specificities to promote exon skipping.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autoantigens", "Base Sequence", "Binding Sites", "Exons", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Protein Binding", "RNA Splicing", "RNA, Messenger", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Zinc Fingers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027286786", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56868191100": {"Name": "Collins K.M.", "AuthorID": "56868191100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57193001984": {"Name": "Ramos A.", "AuthorID": "57193001984", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57195332180": {"Name": "Kainov Y.A.", "AuthorID": "57195332180", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London"}, "6602198520": {"Name": "Makeyev E.V.", "AuthorID": "6602198520", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London"}, "6701424117": {"Name": "Christodolou E.", "AuthorID": "6701424117", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Structural Biology Science Technology Platform, Francis Crick Institute"}, "7202180680": {"Name": "Ray D.", "AuthorID": "7202180680", "AffiliationID": "60021600, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto"}, "6602924726": {"Name": "Morris Q.", "AuthorID": "6602924726", "AffiliationID": "60021600, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto"}, "34975073500": {"Name": "Hughes T.", "AuthorID": "34975073500", "AffiliationID": "60021600, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Donnelly Centre, University of Toronto"}, "7202126752": {"Name": "Taylor I.A.", "AuthorID": "7202126752", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
