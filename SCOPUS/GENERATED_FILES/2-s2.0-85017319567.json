No single technique is capable of providing reliable and accurate positioning in all contexts. In order to operate reliably across different contexts, a multi-sensor navigation system is required to detect its operating context and reconfigure the techniques accordingly. This paper aims to determine the behavioural and environmental contexts together, building the foundation of a context-adaptive navigation system. Both behavioural and environmental context detection results are presented. A hierarchical behavioural recognition scheme is proposed, within which the broad classes of human activities and vehicle motions are detected using measurements from accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers and the barometer on a smartphone by decision trees (DT) and Relevance Vector Machines (RVM). The detection results are further improved by behavioural connectivity. Environmental contexts (e.g., indoor and outdoor) are detected from GNSS measurements using a hidden Markov model. The paper also investigates context association in order to further improve the reliability of context determination. Practical test results demonstrate improvements of environment detection in context determination.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive navigation", "Adaptive navigation systems", "Environment detection", "Environmental contexts", "Multi-sensor navigation systems", "Navigation and positioning", "Operating environment", "Relevance Vector Machine"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017319567", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57193874272": {"Name": "Gao H.", "AuthorID": "57193874272", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8872091700": {"Name": "Groves P.D.", "AuthorID": "8872091700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
