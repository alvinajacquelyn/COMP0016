The existing research on BIM focuses on improving project-based and intra-organisational goals, ignoring the impact of BIM on existing structured long-term Supply Chain (SC) partnerships. The purpose of this study is to explore the interdependences of BIM and cross-project long-term inter-organisational teams. Five projects in the Netherlands, with BIM and SCM implementation, were analysed empirically using case study methods, including interviews, documents analysis and live observations. The BIM-enabled SC partnerships adopted various SCM practices and displayed distinct BIM collaboration patterns. This exploration revealed three main patterns of BIM-based collaboration, that is, ad-hoc, linear and distributed, in the SC partnerships. The three patterns included various quasi-contractual, physical and digital means for BIM collaboration. The study suggests implications about BIM researchers and practitioners for not only implementing BIM, but also further integrating the construction SC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BIM implementation", "Building information modelling", "case study", "supply chain management", "supply chain partnership"], "IndexKeywords": ["BIM implementation", "Building Information Modelling", "Case study methods", "Collaboration patterns", "Documents analysis", "Inter-organisational", "Organisational", "Supply chain managements (SCM)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979966826", "SubjectAreas": [["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"56367767700": {"Name": "Papadonikolaki E.", "AuthorID": "56367767700", "AffiliationID": "60118229, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management in the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology"}, "6507821921": {"Name": "Vrijhoef R.", "AuthorID": "6507821921", "AffiliationID": "60118229, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management in the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology"}, "6507836378": {"Name": "Wamelink H.", "AuthorID": "6507836378", "AffiliationID": "60118229, 60006288", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management in the Built Environment, Delft University of Technology"}}}
