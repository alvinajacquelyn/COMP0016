All rights reserved.The origins of bread have long been associated with the emergence of agriculture and cereal domestication during the Neolithic in southwest Asia. In this study we analyze a total of 24 charred food remains from Shubayqa 1, a Natufian hunter-gatherer site located in northeastern Jordan and dated to 14.6\u201311.6 ka cal BP. Our finds provide empirical data to demonstrate that the preparation and consumption of bread-like products predated the emergence of agriculture by at least 4,000 years. The interdisciplinary analyses indicate the use of some of the \u201cfounder crops\u201d of southwest Asian agriculture (e.g., Triticum boeoticum, wild einkorn) and root foods (e.g., Bolboschoenus glaucus, club-rush tubers) to produce flat bread-like products. The available archaeobotanical evidence for the Natufian period indicates that cereal exploitation was not common during this time, and it is most likely that cereal-based meals like bread become staples only when agriculture was firmly established.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archaeobotany", "Epipaleolithic", "Food", "Hunter-gatherer", "Southwest Asia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bread", "Crops, Agricultural", "Cyperaceae", "History, Ancient", "Jordan", "Plant Tubers", "Triticum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051751124", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56520313600": {"Name": "Arranz-Otaegui A.", "AuthorID": "56520313600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies, University of Copenhagen"}, "57210381681": {"Name": "Richter T.", "AuthorID": "57210381681", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies, University of Copenhagen"}, "57193868126": {"Name": "Carretero L.", "AuthorID": "57193868126", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "56856514600": {"Name": "Ramsey M.", "AuthorID": "56856514600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge"}}}
