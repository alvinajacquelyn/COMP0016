They can be effectively treated by the kinase inhibitor imatinib, which locks the c-KIT kinase domain into an inactive conformation. However resistance to imatinib, driven by active-site mutations, is a recurrent clinical challenge, which has been only partly met by the subsequent development of second and third-generation c-KIT inhibitors. It is reported here that a tetra-substituted naphthalene diimide derivative, which is a micromolar inhibitor of cell growth in a wild-type patient-derived GIST cell line, has a sub-micromolar activity in two distinct patient-derived imatinib-resistant cell lines. The compound has been previously shown to down-regulate expression of the c-KIT protein in a wild-type GIST cell line. It does not affect c-KIT protein expression in a resistant cell line to the same extent, whereas it profoundly down-regulates the expression of the anti-apoptopic protein BCL-2. It is proposed that the mechanism of action involves targeting quadruplex nucleic acid structures, and in particular those in the BCL-2 gene and its RNA transcript. The BCL-2 protein is up-regulated in the GIST-resistant cell line, and is strongly down-regulated after treatment. The compound strongly stabilises a range of G-quadruplexes including a DNA one from the BCL-2 promoter and an RNA quadruplex from its 5\u2032-UTR region. A reporter assay construct incorporating the 5\u2032-UTR quadruplex sequence demonstrates down-regulation of BCL-2 expression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Quadruplex nucleic acids", "Resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Down-Regulation", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "G-Quadruplexes", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Imatinib Mesylate", "Imides", "Ligands", "MCF-7 Cells", "Molecular Structure", "Naphthalenes", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046357642", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"12042112000": {"Name": "Gunaratnam M.", "AuthorID": "12042112000", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35754347600": {"Name": "Collie G.", "AuthorID": "35754347600", "AffiliationID": "60004219", "AffiliationName": "Discovery Sciences, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca"}, "7004716185": {"Name": "Reszka A.", "AuthorID": "7004716185", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7202731062": {"Name": "Todd A.", "AuthorID": "7202731062", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7102183504": {"Name": "Parkinson G.", "AuthorID": "7102183504", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
