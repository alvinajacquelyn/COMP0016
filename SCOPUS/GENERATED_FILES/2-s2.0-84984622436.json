So far, surprisingly few organizers have been discovered, considering the number of patterned tissue types generated during development. This may be because their discovery has relied on transplantation and ablation experiments. Here we describe a new approach, using chick embryos, to discover organizers based on a common gene expression signature, and use it to uncover the anterior intestinal portal (AIP) endoderm as a putative heart organizer. We show that the AIP can induce cardiac identity from non-cardiac mesoderm and that it can pattern this by specifying ventricular and suppressing atrial regional identity. We also uncover some of the signals responsible. The method holds promise as a tool to discover other novel organizers acting during development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Body Patterning", "Chickens", "Endoderm", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Heart", "Heart Atria", "Heart Ventricles", "Intestines", "Mesoderm", "Models, Biological", "Organizers, Embryonic", "Quail", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984622436", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7404307542": {"Name": "Anderson C.", "AuthorID": "7404307542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56815996200": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "56815996200", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Heart Failure Research Center, Academic Medical Center"}, "56899300300": {"Name": "Solovieva T.", "AuthorID": "56899300300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57209079309": {"Name": "Oliveira N.", "AuthorID": "57209079309", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7201805780": {"Name": "Stern C.", "AuthorID": "7201805780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "55634318000": {"Name": "Wong F.", "AuthorID": "55634318000", "AffiliationID": "60026158, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genomics and Genetics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "7102130543": {"Name": "Burt D.", "AuthorID": "7102130543", "AffiliationID": "60026158, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genomics and Genetics, Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "22991061900": {"Name": "Baldock R.", "AuthorID": "22991061900", "AffiliationID": "60012914, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Systems Analysis Section, MRC Human Genetics Unit, IGMM, University of Edinburgh"}, "57204260400": {"Name": "Tickle C.", "AuthorID": "57204260400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath"}}}
