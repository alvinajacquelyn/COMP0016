GlyRs containing the \u03b13 subunit are involved in inflammatory pain sensitization and rhythmic breathing and have received much recent attention. For example, it is unknown whether ethanol affects the function of this important GlyR subtype. Electrophysiologic experiments showed that GlyR \u03b13 subunits were not potentiated by pharmacologic concentrations of ethanol or by Gbg. Thus, we studied GlyR \u03b11-\u03b13 chimeras and mutants to determine the molecular properties that confer ethanol insensitivity. Mutation of corresponding glycine 254 in transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) found in \u03b11 in the \u03b13<sup>A254G</sup>-\u03b11 chimera induced a glycine-evoked current that displayed potentiation during application of ethanol (46 \u00b1 5%, 100 mM) and G\u03b2\u03b3 activation (80 \u00b1 17%). Interestingly, insertion of the intracellular \u03b13L splice cassette into GlyR \u03b11 abolished the enhancement of the glycine-activated current by ethanol (5 \u00b1 6%) and activation by G7\u03b2\u03b3 (21 \u00b1 7%). Incorporation of the GlyR \u03b11 C terminus into the ethanol-resistant \u03b13S<sup>A254G</sup> mutant produced a construct that displayed potentiation of the glycine-activated current with 100 mM ethanol (40 \u00b1 6%) together with a current enhancement after G protein activation (68 \u00b1 25%). Taken together, these data demonstrate that GlyR \u03b13 subunits are not modulated by ethanol. Residue A254 in TM2, the \u03b13L splice cassette, and the C-terminal domain of \u03b13 GlyRs are determinants for low ethanol sensitivity and form the molecular basis of subtype-selective modulation of GlyRs by alcohol.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alternative Splicing", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Ethanol", "GTP-Binding Protein beta Subunits", "GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Mutation", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Rats", "Receptors, Glycine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923357207", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57206664577": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez A.", "AuthorID": "57206664577", "AffiliationID": "60001282", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Department of Physiology, University of Concepci\u00f3n"}, "6506335795": {"Name": "Y\u00e9venes G.", "AuthorID": "6506335795", "AffiliationID": "60001282", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Department of Physiology, University of Concepci\u00f3n"}, "56525860600": {"Name": "Martin L.", "AuthorID": "56525860600", "AffiliationID": "60001282", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Department of Physiology, University of Concepci\u00f3n"}, "36463122100": {"Name": "Burgos C.", "AuthorID": "36463122100", "AffiliationID": "60001282", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Department of Physiology, University of Concepci\u00f3n"}, "8702672800": {"Name": "Moraga-Cid G.", "AuthorID": "8702672800", "AffiliationID": "60001282", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Department of Physiology, University of Concepci\u00f3n"}, "7003949991": {"Name": "Aguayo L.", "AuthorID": "7003949991", "AffiliationID": "60001282", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurophysiology, Department of Physiology, University of Concepci\u00f3n"}, "57203196300": {"Name": "Harvey R.", "AuthorID": "57203196300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, School of Pharmacy"}}}
