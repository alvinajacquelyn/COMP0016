Methods: We compared pre-autopsy PMMR with conventional autopsy for the detection of (1) major pathological abnormalities related to the cause of death and (2) all diagnostic findings in five different body organ systems. PMMR was reported blinded to autopsy findings. Results: In 201 cases, 123/146 (84.2%) of major abnormalities were identified by PMMR. Overall diagnostic accuracy of PMMR was 89.6% [95% confidence interval (CI): 84.3, 93.2%] across all cases, with high concordance 91.8% (95% CI: 89.9, 93.4%) across most organ systems. Our study showed higher concordance than single reporter statistics previously reported in neurological [92.2% vs 73.8%; diff 18.4% (95% CI: 11.0, 25.4%) p < 0.01] and thoracic systems [93.7% vs 81.2%; diff 12.5% (95% CI: 6.3, 18.4%) p < 0.01] and slightly better overall [91.8% vs 87.1%; diff 4.7% (95% CI: 2.1, 7.3%) p < 0.01]. Conclusion: The PMMR examinations can be reliably reported by a single radiologist, following a period of experience and training with this specific modality, with high-diagnostic accuracy for all organ systems. \u00a9 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Learning Curve", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Perinatal Death"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019577466", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57194287164": {"Name": "Ashwin C.", "AuthorID": "57194287164", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57006097800": {"Name": "Hutchinson J.C.", "AuthorID": "57006097800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55722599100": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "55722599100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57218666629": {"Name": "Norman W.", "AuthorID": "57218666629", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "54978610800": {"Name": "Langan D.", "AuthorID": "54978610800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "54953092400": {"Name": "Kang X.", "AuthorID": "54953092400", "AffiliationID": "60033044, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Brugmann, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "7003834531": {"Name": "Jani J.", "AuthorID": "7003834531", "AffiliationID": "60033044, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Brugmann, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "12242900300": {"Name": "Cannie M.", "AuthorID": "12242900300", "AffiliationID": "60069985, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, UZ Brussel, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}}}
