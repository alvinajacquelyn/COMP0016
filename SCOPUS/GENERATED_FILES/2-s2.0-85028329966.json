Early Epipalaeolithic sites are common in the limestone steppe region of eastern Jordan but have yielded only a handful of caprine bones that cannot be identified to species level and few faunal remains from excavated Late Epipalaeolithic sites have been reported. Analysis of animal bone from Shubayqa 1 suggests a significant population of wild sheep could be found concentrated in the basalt desert environment of eastern Jordan during the Late Pleistocene, especially where higher rainfall over the Jebel Druze provided more water. A population of wild sheep was still present in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A when the nearby site of Shubayqa 6 was occupied. Hunting of diverse, locally available resources including wild sheep at the end of the Pleistocene illustrates the flexible and adaptive exploitation strategies that hunter-forager groups engaged in. This provides further evidence to the increasing body of data showing the creative and opportunistic approach of terminal Pleistocene groups allowing continued occupation even in more marginal environments in a period of environmental change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epipalaeolithic", "Late Pleistocene", "Natufian", "Ovis orientalis", "Zoogeography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028329966", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26033627500": {"Name": "Yeomans L.", "AuthorID": "26033627500", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies, University of Copenhagen"}, "57210381681": {"Name": "Richter T.", "AuthorID": "57210381681", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cross-Cultural and Regional Studies, University of Copenhagen"}, "55470564900": {"Name": "Martin L.", "AuthorID": "55470564900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}}}
