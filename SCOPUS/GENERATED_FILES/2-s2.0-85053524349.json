The study aimed to develop a compassion focused therapy intervention for people with dementia with depression and/or anxiety, and to assess its feasibility, acceptability, and utility. Methods: A mixed methods multiple case series (n = 7) was used to assess the intervention's feasibility and changes in self-compassion, mood, anxiety, and quality of life. Outcome measures were administered at pre-intervention, midpoint, and post-intervention. Data were analysed using reliable change and clinically significant change. Thematic analysis on post-therapy interviews and session rating forms was used to assess acceptability and perceived change from the intervention. Results: Over the course of the intervention, improvements in mood, anxiety, and self-compassion were seen, and three of six participants moved out of the clinical depression range. Six participants were able to engage in soothing rhythm breathing, and five in discussion of self-criticism and developing self-compassion. Several participants and their carers described increased self-compassion in response to cognitive decline. Conclusions: Compassion focused therapy can be adapted to be delivered to people with dementia and low mood, anxiety, or other distress. The intervention may improve self-compassion, mood, and anxiety. A larger pilot trial with a comparator group and follow-up is needed to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness for people with dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "CFT", "compassion focused therapy", "dementia", "depression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affect", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anxiety Disorders", "Dementia", "Depressive Disorder", "Empathy", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychotherapy, Group", "Quality of Life", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053524349", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57203916941": {"Name": "Craig C.", "AuthorID": "57203916941", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6507878082": {"Name": "Hiskey S.", "AuthorID": "6507878082", "AffiliationID": "60171633", "AffiliationName": "Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506571193": {"Name": "Royan L.", "AuthorID": "6506571193", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6508296798": {"Name": "Poz R.", "AuthorID": "6508296798", "AffiliationID": "60171632", "AffiliationName": "Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
