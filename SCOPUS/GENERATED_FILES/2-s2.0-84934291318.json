Our objective was to systematically review the evidence regarding the association between prenatal ultrasound signs (intraabdominal bowel dilatation [IABD], extraabdominal bowel dilatation, gastric dilatation [GD], bowel wall thickness, polyhydramnios, and small for gestational age) and perinatal outcomes in gastroschisis (bowel atresia, intra uterine death, neonatal death, time to full enteral feeding, length of total parenteral nutrition and length of in hospital stay). METHODS: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched electronically. Studies exploring the association between antenatal ultrasound signs and outcomes in gastroschisis were considered suitable for inclusion. Two reviewers independently extracted relevant data regarding study characteristics and pregnancy outcome. All meta-analyses were computed using individual data random-effect logistic regression, with single study as the cluster unit. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies, including 2023 fetuses, were included. We found significant positive associations between IABD and bowel atresia (odds ratio [OR]: 5.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.1-9.8), polyhydramnios and bowel atresia (OR: 3.76, 95% CI 1.7-8.3), and GD and neonatal death (OR: 5.58, 95% CI 1.3-24.1). No other ultrasound sign was significantly related to any other outcome. CONCLUSIONS: IABD, polyhydramnios, and GD can be used to an extent to identify a subgroup of neonates with a prenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis at higher risk to develop postnatal complications. Data are still inconclusive on the predictive ability of several signs combined, and large prospective studies are needed to improve the quality of prenatal counseling and the neonatal care for this condition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Gastroschisis", "Gestational Age", "Global Health", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant, Newborn", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Outcome", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934291318", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"55670703500": {"Name": "D'Antonio F.", "AuthorID": "55670703500", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Fetal Medicine Unit, Division of Developmental Sciences, St George's University of London"}, "24833485700": {"Name": "Khalil A.", "AuthorID": "24833485700", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Fetal Medicine Unit, Division of Developmental Sciences, St George's University of London"}, "36490456200": {"Name": "Virgone C.", "AuthorID": "36490456200", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Neonatal Surgery, St George's Healthcare National Health Service Trust, University of London"}, "7102544316": {"Name": "Giuliani S.", "AuthorID": "7102544316", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric and Neonatal Surgery, St George's Healthcare National Health Service Trust, University of London"}, "7102724281": {"Name": "Rizzo G.", "AuthorID": "7102724281", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Universit\u00e0 di Roma Tor Vergata"}, "6603465854": {"Name": "Baud D.", "AuthorID": "6603465854", "AffiliationID": "60023561", "AffiliationName": "Materno-Fetal and Obstetrics Research Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital"}, "57189638108": {"Name": "Cohen-Overbeek T.E.", "AuthorID": "57189638108", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Division of Obstetrics and Prenatal Medicine, Erasmus MC"}, "22934617000": {"Name": "Kuleva M.", "AuthorID": "22934617000", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60123796, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique des H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "7101694616": {"Name": "Salomon L.J.", "AuthorID": "7101694616", "AffiliationID": "60026877, 60123796, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Necker-Enfants Malades, Assistance Publique des H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes"}, "55317725700": {"Name": "Flacco M.E.", "AuthorID": "55317725700", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Aging Sciences, University of Chieti-Pescara"}, "9943483200": {"Name": "Manzoli L.", "AuthorID": "9943483200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "EMISAC (Epidemiologia e Management dell'Invecchiamento e Salubrit\u00e0 Degli Ambienti Confinati), CeSI Biotech"}}}
