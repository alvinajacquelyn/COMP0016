The objective of this work was to characterize a hybrid filler material, which is capable to coat as a thin film porous scaffolds improving their mechanical properties for bone tissue engineering. The hybrid filler material is a blend of chitosan and silica network formed through in situ sol-gel using tetraethylortosilicate and 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) as silica precursors. The hypothesis was that the epoxy ring of GPTMS could react with the amino groups of chitosan in acidic media while it is also reacting the siloxane groups of hydrolyzed silica precursors. The formation of the hybrid organic-inorganic network was assessed by different physical techniques revealing changes in molecular mobility and hydrophilicity upon chemical reaction. Finally, the cytotoxicity of the samples was also evaluated by MTT assay.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomaterials", "chitosan", "GPTMS", "silicas", "sol-gel", "TEOS", "thermal properties"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-Glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane", "Bone tissue engineering", "GPTMS", "Hybrid organic-inorganic", "Mechanical performance", "Molecular mobility", "Silica precursors", "TEOS"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939451832", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55897730600": {"Name": "Trujillo S.", "AuthorID": "55897730600", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering,CBIT, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "57200676949": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Rom\u00e1n E.", "AuthorID": "57200676949", "AffiliationID": "60011476", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering,CBIT, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia"}, "7005194174": {"Name": "G\u00f5mez Ribelles J.L.", "AuthorID": "7005194174", "AffiliationID": "60085101", "AffiliationName": "CIBER in Bioengineering, Biomaterials and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN)"}, "18936516600": {"Name": "Pandis C.", "AuthorID": "18936516600", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National Technical University of Athens, Zografou Campus"}, "7006878274": {"Name": "Kyritsis A.", "AuthorID": "7006878274", "AffiliationID": "60002947", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, National Technical University of Athens, Zografou Campus"}}}
