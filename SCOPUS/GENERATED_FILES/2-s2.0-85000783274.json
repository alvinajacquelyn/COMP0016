Earlier reports have shown gabapentin to be effective in sensory laryngeal neuropathy and symptom conditions that have a proven neural origin. We present a case report of a patient with chronic refractory cough due to a soft tissue mass in the lung that caused compression of the mediastinal structures. The patient was successfully treated with gabapentin with reduction in the cough intensity, duration, and frequency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Gabapentin", "Refractory cough"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000783274", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55751757900": {"Name": "Atreya S.", "AuthorID": "55751757900", "AffiliationID": "112443549", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care and Psycho-oncology, Tata Medical Center"}, "56378915500": {"Name": "Kumar G.", "AuthorID": "56378915500", "AffiliationID": "112443549", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care and Psycho-oncology, Tata Medical Center"}, "8339551100": {"Name": "Datta S.", "AuthorID": "8339551100", "AffiliationID": "112443549", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care and Psycho-oncology, Tata Medical Center"}}}
