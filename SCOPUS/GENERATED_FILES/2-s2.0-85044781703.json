Endogenous fatty acid (FA) synthesis represents a potentially critical process in myelinating glia. Using genetically modified mice, we show that Schwann cell (SC) intrinsic activity of the enzyme essential for de novo FA synthesis, fatty acid synthase (FASN), is crucial for precise lipid composition of peripheral nerves and fundamental for the correct onset of myelination and proper myelin growth. Upon FASN depletion in SCs, epineurial adipocytes undergo lipolysis, suggestive of a compensatory role. Mechanistically, we found that a lack of FASN in SCs leads to an impairment of the peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3-regulated transcriptional program. In agreement, defects in myelination of FASN-deficient SCs could be ameliorated by treatment with the PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone ex vivo and in vivo. Our results reveal that FASN-driven de novo FA synthesis in SCs is mandatory for myelination and identify lipogenic activation of the PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional network as a putative downstream functional mediator.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Fatty Acid Synthase, Type I", "Fatty Acids", "Female", "Lipogenesis", "Male", "Mice, 129 Strain", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Inbred DBA", "Mice, Knockout", "Myelin Sheath", "Nerve Fibers, Myelinated", "PPAR gamma", "Rosiglitazone", "Schwann Cells", "Sciatic Nerve", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044781703", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"14010157000": {"Name": "Montani L.", "AuthorID": "14010157000", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "16643703000": {"Name": "Pereira J.", "AuthorID": "16643703000", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "8527869800": {"Name": "Norrm\u00e9n C.", "AuthorID": "8527869800", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "23111320100": {"Name": "Pohl H.", "AuthorID": "23111320100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "12803254000": {"Name": "Tinelli E.", "AuthorID": "12803254000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "48161010000": {"Name": "Figlia G.", "AuthorID": "48161010000", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57201432169": {"Name": "Dimas P.", "AuthorID": "57201432169", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "55953681700": {"Name": "von Niederh\u00e4usern B.", "AuthorID": "55953681700", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical Research, University and University Hospital Basel"}, "57201422669": {"Name": "Schwager R.", "AuthorID": "57201422669", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "7103232215": {"Name": "Suter U.", "AuthorID": "7103232215", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "24482763200": {"Name": "Tr\u00f6tzm\u00fcller M.", "AuthorID": "24482763200", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Lipidomics Center for Medical Research, Medical University"}, "6508262043": {"Name": "K\u00f6feler H.", "AuthorID": "6508262043", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Lipidomics Center for Medical Research, Medical University"}, "9039099400": {"Name": "Jessberger S.", "AuthorID": "9039099400", "AffiliationID": "60005666, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Brain Research Institute, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "7006372841": {"Name": "Semenkovich C.", "AuthorID": "7006372841", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism and Lipid Research, Washington University Medical School"}}}
