However, these CNN-based models employ a grid map to represent spatial data, which is unsuitable for road-network-based data. To address this problem, we propose a deep spatio-temporal residual neural network for road-network-based data modeling (DSTR-RNet). The proposed model constructs locally-connected neural network layers (LCNR) to model road network topology and integrates residual learning to model the spatio-temporal dependency. We test the DSTR-RNet by predicting the traffic flow of Didi cab service, in an 8-km2 region with 2,616 road segments in Chengdu, China. The results demonstrate that the DSTR-RNet maintains the spatial precision and topology of the road network as well as improves the prediction accuracy. We discuss the prediction errors and compare the prediction results to those of grid-based CNN models. We also explore the sensitivity of the model to its parameters; this will aid the application of this model to network-based data modeling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["deep learning", "residual neural network", "road network", "Spatio-temporal modeling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063991537", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57201004030": {"Name": "Ren Y.", "AuthorID": "57201004030", "AffiliationID": "60138680", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Regional Oceanography and Numerical Modeling, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology"}, "35200522100": {"Name": "Cheng T.", "AuthorID": "35200522100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57196203282": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57196203282", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
