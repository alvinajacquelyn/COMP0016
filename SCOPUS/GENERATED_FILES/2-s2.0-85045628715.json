The main problem for BNs is inference: Determine the probability of an event given observed evidence. Since exact inference is often infeasible for large BNs, popular approximate inference methods rely on sampling. We study the problem of determining the expected time to obtain a single valid sample from a BN. To this end, we translate the BN together with observations into a probabilistic program. We provide proof rules that yield the exact expected runtime of this program in a fully automated fashion. We implemented our approach and successfully analyzed various real\u2013world BNs taken from the Bayesian network repository.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Expected runtimes", "Probabilistic programs", "Program verification", "Weakest preconditions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximate inference", "Bayesian Networks (bns)", "Probabilistic graphical models", "Probabilistic programs", "Program analysis", "Program Verification", "Runtimes", "Weakest precondition"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045628715", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57201671678": {"Name": "Batz K.", "AuthorID": "57201671678", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "RWTH Aachen University"}, "47962346900": {"Name": "Kaminski B.", "AuthorID": "47962346900", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "RWTH Aachen University"}, "7003679176": {"Name": "Katoen J.", "AuthorID": "7003679176", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "RWTH Aachen University"}, "57028509700": {"Name": "Matheja C.", "AuthorID": "57028509700", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "RWTH Aachen University"}}}
