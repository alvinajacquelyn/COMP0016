We have further adapted and implemented the Minlo\u2032method on top of the NLO calculation underlying our W+W\u2212+ jet generator. Thus, the resulting simulation achieves NLO accuracy not only for inclusive distributions in W+W\u2212+ jet production but also W+W\u2212production, i.e. when the associated jet is not resolved, without the introduction of any unphysical merging scale. This work represents the first extension of the Minlo\u2032method, in its original form, to the case of a genuine underlying 2 \u2192 2 process, with non-trivial virtual corrections.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Jets", "NLO Computations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987815227", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"35285524400": {"Name": "Hamilton K.", "AuthorID": "35285524400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "44461794400": {"Name": "Melia T.", "AuthorID": "44461794400", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical Physics Group, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}, "51461786000": {"Name": "Monni P.", "AuthorID": "51461786000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Rudolf Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford"}, "57206150370": {"Name": "Zanderighi G.", "AuthorID": "57206150370", "AffiliationID": "60019778", "AffiliationName": "Theoretical Physics Department, CERN"}, "24587889900": {"Name": "Re E.", "AuthorID": "24587889900", "AffiliationID": "60019513, 60026007, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "LAPTh, Universit\u00e9 Savoie Mont Blanc, CNRS"}}}
