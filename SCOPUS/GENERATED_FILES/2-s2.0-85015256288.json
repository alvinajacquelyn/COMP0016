Programmatic testing occurs in primary care, which may be inaccessible for some individuals. Current strategies could therefore be complemented by screening in other settings. OBJECTIVE : To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of LTBI screening in a community college. DE S IGN: A cohort study using observational data collected during the pilot study. Eligible students from high-incidence countries provided consent and were tested with a single-step interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and enrolled. We used single and multivariable analyses to estimate screening effectiveness and to explore different subgroups. We included costs from a UK National Health Service perspective. RESULT S : Screening uptake was 75% and treatment completion was 85%. Of 440 students, 71 (16%) were LTBI-positive; two had active TB. There was an association of positivity with age and incidence in the country of origin. Three incidence thresholds met our criteria for screening: countries with .40, .100 and .200 cases per 100 000 population, plus students from sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUS ION: We found that LTBI screening can be offered effectively in a community college, and could be a complement to primary care-based programmes in low-incidence countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community college", "LTBI screening", "Recent migrants", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Cohort Studies", "Costs and Cost Analysis", "England", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Interferon-gamma Release Tests", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Pilot Projects", "Students", "Transients and Migrants", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015256288", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57194165689": {"Name": "Usdin M.", "AuthorID": "57194165689", "AffiliationID": "60000733", "AffiliationName": "PHE Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control"}, "6505927242": {"Name": "Zenner D.", "AuthorID": "6505927242", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit in Respiratory Infections, Imperial College London"}, "6701395179": {"Name": "Dedicoat M.", "AuthorID": "6701395179", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Heart of England Foundation Trust"}, "55157018700": {"Name": "Gajraj R.", "AuthorID": "55157018700", "AffiliationID": "119676653", "AffiliationName": "PHE West Midlands"}, "56367325200": {"Name": "Harrison P.", "AuthorID": "56367325200", "AffiliationID": "100832337", "AffiliationName": "South and City College Birmingham"}, "57209183372": {"Name": "Kaur H.", "AuthorID": "57209183372", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham and Solihull TB Service, Heart of England National Health Service Trust"}, "57193605241": {"Name": "Duffield K.", "AuthorID": "57193605241", "AffiliationID": "60000733", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, PHE"}, "57158338600": {"Name": "Walker C.L.", "AuthorID": "57158338600", "AffiliationID": "60000733", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, PHE"}, "56597958800": {"Name": "Akram Y.", "AuthorID": "56597958800", "AffiliationID": "60000733", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, PHE"}, "35483183000": {"Name": "Aiyedun V.", "AuthorID": "35483183000", "AffiliationID": "60000733", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, PHE"}, "15846302700": {"Name": "Mohamed H.", "AuthorID": "15846302700", "AffiliationID": "60000733", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, PHE"}}}
