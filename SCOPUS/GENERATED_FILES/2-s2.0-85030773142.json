More recently, however, it has been extended beyond the brain to explain the dynamics of living systems, and their unique capacity to avoid decay. The aim of this review is to synthesise these advances with a meta-theoretical ontology of biological systems called variational neuroethology, which integrates the FEP with Tinbergen's four research questions to explain biological systems across spatial and temporal scales. We exemplify this framework by applying it to Homo sapiens, before translating variational neuroethology into a systematic research heuristic that supplies the biological, cognitive, and social sciences with a computationally tractable guide to discovery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complex adaptive systems", "Evolutionary systems theory", "Free energy principle", "Hierarchically mechanistic mind", "Physics of the mind", "Variational neuroethology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex adaptive systems", "Energy principles", "Evolutionary system", "Hierarchically mechanistic mind", "Neuroethology", "Heuristics", "Neurons", "Neurosciences", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030773142", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"56986708800": {"Name": "Ramstead M.J.D.", "AuthorID": "56986708800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, Department of Psychiatry, McGill University"}, "8788773200": {"Name": "Badcock P.B.", "AuthorID": "8788773200", "AffiliationID": "60003438", "AffiliationName": "Orygen, the National Centre of Excellence in Youth Mental Health"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
