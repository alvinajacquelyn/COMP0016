To the date, there is no established disease-modifying treatment and the symptomatic therapies are limited. Recent advances in the understanding of HD pathology, natural history and improvements in clinical research methodology have provided an unprecedented opportunity to find effective treatments for HD. Areas covered: Current treatment options for motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms are discussed. Symptomatic therapies are, in most cases, limited to expert-based approaches rather than evidence-based medicine. Future therapeutic candidates include a wide spectrum of targets, including cellular energetic dysfunction, protein homeostasis, gene editing techniques and functional neurosurgery strategies. We review the spectrum of potential targets for future clinical research and the currently ongoing clinical trials in HD. Expert opinion: The likelihood of success based on previous data is high in some trials such as Pridopidine (Pride-HD), and encouraging in others, such as the new gene \u2018editing\u2019 strategies, which have already entered phase I human clinical trials and showed promising results from preclinical studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical trials", "deep brain stimulation", "gene editing", "Huntington\u2019s disease", "review", "tetrabenazine", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979663171", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)", "PHAR", "3001"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57131111500": {"Name": "Est\u00e9vez-Fraga C.", "AuthorID": "57131111500", "AffiliationID": "60021609", "AffiliationName": "Servicio de Neurolog\u00eda, Hospital Ram\u00f3n y Cajal de Madrid"}, "36467972800": {"Name": "Avil\u00e9s Olmos I.", "AuthorID": "36467972800", "AffiliationID": "60110856", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Ram\u00f3n y Cajal de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria"}, "26538854800": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Send\u00f3n Moreno J.", "AuthorID": "26538854800", "AffiliationID": "60110856", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Ram\u00f3n y Cajal de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria"}, "57190395485": {"Name": "Ma\u00f1anes Barral V.", "AuthorID": "57190395485", "AffiliationID": "60110856", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Ram\u00f3n y Cajal de Investigaci\u00f3n Sanitaria"}}}
