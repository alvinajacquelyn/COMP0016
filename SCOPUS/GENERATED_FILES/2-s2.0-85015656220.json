The current study aimed to follow up a group of adolescents who had originally participated in a randomized controlled trial of CBT for BDD to determine whether treatment gains were maintained. Twenty-six adolescents (mean age = 16.2, SD = 1.6) with a primary diagnosis of BDD received a course of developmentally tailored CBT and were followed up over 12 months. Participants were assessed at baseline, midtreatment, posttreatment, 2-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the clinician-rated Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified for BDD. Secondary outcomes included measures of insight, depression, quality of life, and global functioning. BDD symptoms decreased significantly from pre- to posttreatment and remained stable over the 12-month follow-up. At this time point, 50% of participants were classified as responders and 23% as remitters. Participants remained significantly improved on all secondary outcomes at 12-month follow-up. Neither baseline insight nor baseline depression predicted long-term outcomes. The positive effects of CBT appear to be durable up to 12-month follow-up. However, the majority of patients remained symptomatic and vulnerable to a range of risks at 12-month follow-up, indicating that longer-term monitoring is advisable in this population. Future research should focus on enhancing the efficacy of CBT in order to improve long-term outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "body dysmorphic disorder", "children", "cognitive-behavioral therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Body Dysmorphic Disorders", "Cognitive Therapy", "Depression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Time", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015656220", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"35275280100": {"Name": "Krebs G.", "AuthorID": "35275280100", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56025929200": {"Name": "Bowyer L.", "AuthorID": "56025929200", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8517380400": {"Name": "Anson M.", "AuthorID": "8517380400", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102803269": {"Name": "Veale D.", "AuthorID": "7102803269", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57190882020": {"Name": "de la Cruz L.F.", "AuthorID": "57190882020", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institutet"}, "24605780500": {"Name": "Monzani B.", "AuthorID": "24605780500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003916653": {"Name": "Heyman I.", "AuthorID": "7003916653", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7004084003": {"Name": "Mataix-Cols D.", "AuthorID": "7004084003", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56915655500": {"Name": "Cadman J.", "AuthorID": "56915655500", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Griffith University"}, "7402367352": {"Name": "Turner C.", "AuthorID": "7402367352", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "University of Queensland"}}}
