The effect of probe sonication as a size reduction method on drug incorporation and the properties of aerosols generated using air-jet and vibrating-mesh nebulisers was studied. The use of the Next Generation Impactor (NGI) to characterise inhaler formulations is limited by the need accurately to quantify drug deposited across 8 stages and is labour intensive to use. The Fast Screening Impactor (FSI) comprising two impaction stages was compared with the NGI to evaluate its applicability as a simple screening and labour-saving tool to characterise nebulised systems. For the developed liposomal formulations, an air-jet nebuliser generated a two-fold higher fine particle fraction (FPF) than a vibrating-mesh nebuliser. The findings demonstrated that the cooled FSI (5\u00b0C) operated at 15 L/min was effective in differentiating the aerosol properties of the nebulised liposome formulations investigated. Overall, the optimised co-loaded liposomes were more effectively delivered by an air-jet nebuliser, than from a vibrating-mesh nebuliser over a 10 min period as determined using the abbreviated impactor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Erlotinib", "Genistein", "Impactor", "Nebuliser", "Probe-sonication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosols", "Erlotinib Hydrochloride", "Genistein", "Liposomes", "Nebulizers and Vaporizers", "Particle Size", "Technology, Pharmaceutical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042859816", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57201012650": {"Name": "Nimmano N.", "AuthorID": "57201012650", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8774245700": {"Name": "Somavarapu S.", "AuthorID": "8774245700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7403523237": {"Name": "Taylor K.M.G.", "AuthorID": "7403523237", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
