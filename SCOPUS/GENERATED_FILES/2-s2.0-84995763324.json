Reactions were carried out in presence of the catalyst K2O:ZrO2:ZnO/MgO-SiO2, prepared by co-precipitation methods. Mathematical models were developed to correlate observed product selectivities, 1,3-BD yields and productivities with the manipulated reaction variables, allowing for quantification of variable effects on catalyst activity and assessment of the kinetic mechanism. Obtained 1,3-BD productivities were as high as 0.5gBD/gcat h,gBD/gcat h, with 1,3-BD yields of 27%. Results suggest that acetaldehyde condensation is the rate determining step.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1,3-Butadiene", "Ethanol", "Experimental design", "Kinetics", "Silica-magnesia catalyst"], "IndexKeywords": ["1 ,3-butadiene", "Coprecipitation method", "Kinetic mechanism", "Product selectivities", "Rate determining step", "Reaction temperature", "Reaction variables", "Weight hourly space velocity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995763324", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"55626470100": {"Name": "Da Ros S.", "AuthorID": "55626470100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "35465490100": {"Name": "Pinto J.C.", "AuthorID": "35465490100", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Programa de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica/COPPE, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro"}, "35230030600": {"Name": "Jones M.D.", "AuthorID": "35230030600", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "23991000700": {"Name": "Mattia D.", "AuthorID": "23991000700", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "14033105200": {"Name": "Schwaab M.", "AuthorID": "14033105200", "AffiliationID": "60006726", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Engenharia Qu\u00edmica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul"}, "7004514118": {"Name": "Noronha F.B.", "AuthorID": "7004514118", "AffiliationID": "60012366", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Division, National Institute of Technology"}}}
