These operations are (i) generally carried out manually by experts with limited computer support, (ii) hugely time consuming, and (iii) often inaccurate, incomplete, and prone to errors. Results: In this paper we present SEEG Assistant, a set of tools integrated in a single 3DSlicer extension, which aims to assist neurosurgeons in the analysis of post-implant structural data and hence aid the neurophysiologist in the interpretation of SEEG data. SEEG Assistant consists of (i) a module to localize the electrode contact positions using imaging data from a thresholded post-implant CT, (ii) a module to determine the most probable cerebral location of the recorded activity, and (iii) a module to compute the Grey Matter Proximity Index, i.e. the distance of each contact from the cerebral cortex, in order to discriminate between white and grey matter location of contacts. Finally, exploiting 3DSlicer capabilities, SEEG Assistant offers a Graphical User Interface that simplifies the interaction between the user and the tools. SEEG Assistant has been tested on 40 patients segmenting 555 electrodes, and it has been used to identify the neuroanatomical loci and to compute the distance to the nearest cerebral cortex for 9626 contacts. We also performed manual segmentation and compared the results between the proposed tool and gold-standard clinical practice. As a result, the use of SEEG Assistant decreases the post implant processing time by more than 2 orders of magnitude, improves the quality of results and decreases, if not eliminates, errors in post implant processing. Conclusions: The SEEG Assistant Framework for the first time supports physicists by providing a set of open-source tools for post-implant processing of SEEG data. Furthermore, SEEG Assistant has been integrated into 3D Slicer, a software platform for the analysis and visualization of medical images, overcoming limitations of command-line tools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automatic segmentation", "Epilepsy", "Epileptic zone detections", "GMPI", "Medical imaging", "SEEG"], "IndexKeywords": ["Automatic segmentations", "Epilepsy", "GMPI", "SEEG", "Zone detection", "Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "User-Computer Interface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013812286", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"6506859789": {"Name": "Narizzano M.", "AuthorID": "6506859789", "AffiliationID": "60121711, 60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Department of Informatics, Bioengineering Robotics and System engineering (DIBRIS)"}, "36944046300": {"Name": "Arnulfo G.", "AuthorID": "36944046300", "AffiliationID": "60121711, 60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Department of Informatics, Bioengineering Robotics and System engineering (DIBRIS)"}, "57038690600": {"Name": "Toselli B.", "AuthorID": "57038690600", "AffiliationID": "60121711, 60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Department of Informatics, Bioengineering Robotics and System engineering (DIBRIS)"}, "57210766595": {"Name": "Canessa A.", "AuthorID": "57210766595", "AffiliationID": "60121711, 60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Department of Informatics, Bioengineering Robotics and System engineering (DIBRIS)"}, "7004706468": {"Name": "Fato M.M.", "AuthorID": "7004706468", "AffiliationID": "60121711, 60025153", "AffiliationName": "University of Genoa, Department of Informatics, Bioengineering Robotics and System engineering (DIBRIS)"}, "57193427235": {"Name": "Ricci S.", "AuthorID": "57193427235", "AffiliationID": "60029759", "AffiliationName": "CUNY Medical School, Departement of Physiology Pharmacology and Neuroscience"}, "16242763100": {"Name": "Tisdall M.", "AuthorID": "16242763100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004819821": {"Name": "Cardinale F.", "AuthorID": "7004819821", "AffiliationID": "60015708", "AffiliationName": "Claudio Munari Center for Epilepsy Surgery, Niguarda Hospital"}}}
