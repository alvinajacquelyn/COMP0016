Methods: Using population-based administrative data from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan, we identified 22,696 newly diagnosed migraineurs (mean age 44.5 years) and a matched migraine-free cohort of 90,784 individuals in the period 2000-2008. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was conducted for assessing the ET risk for the migraine cohort compared to the migraine-free cohort. Results: After adjusting for covariates, the migraine cohort had a 1.83-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.50-2.23) of subsequent ET in comparison to the migraine-free cohort (8.97 vs. 4.81 per 10,000 person-years). In the subgroup analysis, patients with migraine were associated with higher risks of ET, regardless of gender, age or the existence of comorbidities. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated an association between migraine and ET, suggesting a possible shared pathophysiology underpinning both disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cohort Studies", "Essential Tremor", "Humans", "Migraine Disorders", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Retrospective Studies", "Taiwan"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015308986", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36644418400": {"Name": "Lau C.I.", "AuthorID": "36644418400", "AffiliationID": "60005101", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Fu-Jen Catholic University"}, "7501735361": {"Name": "Wang H.C.", "AuthorID": "7501735361", "AffiliationID": "60025370, 60005429", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, National Taiwan University"}, "25925652800": {"Name": "Chen W.H.", "AuthorID": "25925652800", "AffiliationID": "60022095", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University"}, "57191725179": {"Name": "Lin C.C.", "AuthorID": "57191725179", "AffiliationID": "60006121", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Service Research Center (HSRC), Taichung Veterans General Hospital"}, "57200168118": {"Name": "Chen H.J.", "AuthorID": "57200168118", "AffiliationID": "60006988", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, China Medical University"}, "55769154100": {"Name": "Liang J.A.", "AuthorID": "55769154100", "AffiliationID": "60031941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, China Medical University Hospital"}}}
