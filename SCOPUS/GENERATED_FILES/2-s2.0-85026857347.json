A significant contribution of immune regulatory cells, including regulatory T cells, to tumor progression has been widely reported. An emerging body of evidence has recently recognized a role for B cells in modulating the immune response to tumors and lymphoid malignancies. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) are a newly designated subset of B cells that have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating immune responses involved in inflammation, autoimmunity and, more recently, cancer. Bregs can suppress diverse cell subtypes, including T cells, through the secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-10, and can facilitate the conversion of T cells to regulatory T cells, thus attenuating anti-tumor immune responses. Similar B-cell subpopulations have been reported to be recruited to the tumor but to acquire their immunosuppressive properties within the tumor bed and thereby attenuate anti-tumor immune responses. However, despite a pivotal role for Bregs in promoting inflammation and carcinogenesis, the phenotypic diversity of the cell surface markers that are unique to Bregs remains unclear in mice and humans. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of Bregs and review our current knowledge of Bregs and their inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses in murine tumor models and cancer patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "immunotherapy", "regulatory B cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocyte Subsets", "B-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Immunity", "Interleukin-10", "Mice", "Neoplasms", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026857347", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55861155600": {"Name": "Sarvaria A.", "AuthorID": "55861155600", "AffiliationID": "60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "57201015291": {"Name": "Madrigal J.", "AuthorID": "57201015291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan and University College London"}, "7004019930": {"Name": "Saudemont A.", "AuthorID": "7004019930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan and University College London"}}}
