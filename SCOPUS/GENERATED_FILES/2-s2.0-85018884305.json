In low-incidence countries, a high proportion of TB cases are notified among migrants, which often occurs due to LTBI reactivation.We aimed to review the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening migrants for active TB LTBI to inform and support the TB elimination strategy in low-incidence countries. We carried out a narrative review of English language articles published between 1 January 2000 and 31 June 2016 using the PubMed database. All studies that described the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of active TB or LTBI screening amongmigrantswere included.We identified 55 studies, and included 40 for the effectiveness of screening, 11 for cost-effectiveness and 4 that reported both. Screening for active TB can be effective and costeffective depending on the setting, target group and screening approach. Pre-entry screening programmes have some impact on the epidemiology of the receiving countries. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening as predicted in mathematical models is also highly setting-specific, with best potential results achieved if screening is restricted to high-risk groups and/ or to migrants from high-burden countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cost-effectiveness", "Effectiveness", "LTBI screening", "Public health impact", "TB case finding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Humans", "Incidence", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Mass Screening", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Transients and Migrants", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018884305", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6505927242": {"Name": "Zenner D.", "AuthorID": "6505927242", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, National Institute for Health Research, Health Protection Research Unit in Respiratory Infections"}, "57195426763": {"Name": "Hafezi H.", "AuthorID": "57195426763", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, Public Health England Colindale"}, "7403341494": {"Name": "Potter J.", "AuthorID": "7403341494", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Blizard Institute, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health"}, "12772429700": {"Name": "Capone S.", "AuthorID": "12772429700", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Universit \u00c0 degli Studi di Brescia"}, "7006442223": {"Name": "Matteelli A.", "AuthorID": "7006442223", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Universit \u00c0 degli Studi di Brescia"}}}
