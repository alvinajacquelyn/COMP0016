High electroencephalography (EEG) frequencies, above 20 Hz, have previously been implicated in psychosis and schizophrenia. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the effect of intravenous THC compared to placebo on high-frequency EEG. Methods: A double-blind cross-over study design was used. In the resting state, the high-beta to low-gamma magnitude (21-45 Hz) was investigated (n\u2208=\u220813 pairs\u2208+\u22084 THC only). Also, the event-related synchronisation (ERS) of motor-associated high gamma was studied using a self-paced button press task (n\u2208=\u220815). Results: In the resting state, there was a significant condition \u00d7 frequency interaction (p\u2208=\u22080.00017), consisting of a shift towards higher frequencies under THC conditions (reduced high beta [21-27 Hz] and increased low gamma [27-45 Hz]). There was also a condition \u00d7 frequency \u00d7 location interaction (p\u2208=\u22080.006), such that the reduction in 21-27-Hz magnitude tended to be more prominent in anterior regions, whilst posterior areas tended to show greater 27-45-Hz increases. This effect was correlated with positive symptoms, as assessed on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (r\u2208=\u22080.429, p\u2208=\u22080.042). In the motor task, there was a main effect of THC to increase 65-130-Hz ERS (p\u2208=\u22080.035) over contra-lateral sensorimotor areas, which was driven by increased magnitude in the higher, 85-130-Hz band (p\u2208=\u22080.02) and not the 65-85-Hz band. Conclusions: The THC-induced shift to faster gamma oscillations may represent an over-activation of the cortex, possibly related to saliency misattribution in the delusional state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beta", "Cannabis", "EEG", "Gamma", "Psychosis", "THC"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain Waves", "Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cross-Over Studies", "Double-Blind Method", "Dronabinol", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939894254", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"35222238900": {"Name": "Nottage J.", "AuthorID": "35222238900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "35254619400": {"Name": "Stone J.", "AuthorID": "35254619400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "35406239400": {"Name": "Murray R.", "AuthorID": "35406239400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "6701681353": {"Name": "Ffytche D.", "AuthorID": "6701681353", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "57210428289": {"Name": "Morrison P.", "AuthorID": "57210428289", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "55981515100": {"Name": "Sumich A.", "AuthorID": "55981515100", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Trent University"}, "8089378900": {"Name": "Bramon-Bosch E.", "AuthorID": "8089378900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
