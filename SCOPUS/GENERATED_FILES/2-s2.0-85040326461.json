We explore whether maternal resilience functions as a protective or compensatory factor. In Studies 1 and 2, using moderated multiple regression models, we found evidence that maternal resilience functioned as a compensatory factor\u2014having a significant independent main effect relationship with well-being outcomes in mothers of children with DD and autism spectrum disorder. However, there was no longitudinal association between resilience and maternal well-being outcomes. There was little evidence of the role of resilience as a protective factor between child behavior problems and maternal well-being in both studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder", "Developmental disability", "Mothers", "Psychological well-being", "Resilience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Developmental Disabilities", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mothers", "Problem Behavior", "Protective Factors", "Resilience, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040326461", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"56098608000": {"Name": "Halstead E.", "AuthorID": "56098608000", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Bangor University"}, "35174707300": {"Name": "Griffith G.M.", "AuthorID": "35174707300", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Bangor University"}, "33367964000": {"Name": "Ekas N.", "AuthorID": "33367964000", "AffiliationID": "60019424", "AffiliationName": "Texas Christian University"}, "7102719472": {"Name": "Hastings R.P.", "AuthorID": "7102719472", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}}}
