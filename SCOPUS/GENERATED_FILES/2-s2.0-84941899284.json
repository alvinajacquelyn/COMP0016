This practice assumes that there is an FEC code that will reduce the BER after decoding to the desired level. In this paper, we challenge this practice and show that the concept of a channel-independent FEC limit is invalid for soft-decision bit-wise decoding. It is shown that for low code rates and high-order modulation formats, the use of the soft-decision FEC limit paradigm can underestimate the spectral efficiencies by up to 20%. A better predictor for the BER after decoding is the generalized mutual information, which is shown to give consistent post-FEC BER predictions across different channel conditions and modulation formats. Extensive optical full-field simulations and experiments are carried out in both the linear and nonlinear transmission regimes to confirm the theoretical analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bit error rate", "forward error correction", "generalized mutual information", "mutual information", "soft-decision decoding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Channel independent", "Generalized mutual information", "High order modulation", "Modulation formats", "Mutual informations", "Nonlinear transmission", "Soft decision decoding", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941899284", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"23476771600": {"Name": "Alvarado A.", "AuthorID": "23476771600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "16053296900": {"Name": "Maher R.", "AuthorID": "16053296900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701439390": {"Name": "Agrell E.", "AuthorID": "6701439390", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
