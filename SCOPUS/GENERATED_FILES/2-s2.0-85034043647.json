This article provides a systematic, stepwise approach for identifying the aetiology of limb length discrepancy following total hip arthroplasty and provides guidance on the treatment of this complication to optimize postoperative clinical and functional outcomes. This review discusses postoperative history taking, clinical examination, radiographic assessment, conservative treatment, and surgical intervention for the management of patients with established limb length discrepancy following total hip arthroplasty. A comprehensive understanding of the multifactorial nature and methods of managing postoperative limb length discrepancy is essential for optimizing patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes and long-term function following total hip arthroplasty.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Conservative Treatment", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Leg Length Inequality", "Reoperation", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034043647", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"53979939900": {"Name": "Kayani B.", "AuthorID": "53979939900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, Specialty Registrar in Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "56504959400": {"Name": "Pietrzak J.", "AuthorID": "56504959400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "57197712080": {"Name": "Donaldson M.J.", "AuthorID": "57197712080", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "24466324900": {"Name": "Konan S.", "AuthorID": "24466324900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospital"}}}
