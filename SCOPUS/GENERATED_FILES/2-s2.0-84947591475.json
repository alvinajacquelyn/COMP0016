Fetoscopic guidance provides insufficient sensitivity for imaging the vasculature that lies beneath the fetal placental surface due to strong light scattering in biological tissues. Incomplete photocoagulation of anastamoses is associated with postoperative complications and higher perinatal mortality. In this study, we investigated the use of multi-spectral photoacoustic (PA) imaging for better visualization of the placental vasculature. Excitation light was delivered with an optical fiber with dimensions that are compatible with the working channel of a fetoscope. Imaging was performed on an ex vivo normal term human placenta collected at Caesarean section birth. The photoacoustically-generated ultrasound signals were received by an external clinical linear array ultrasound imaging probe. A vein under illumination on the fetal placenta surface was visualized with PA imaging, and good correspondence was obtained between the measured PA spectrum and the optical absorption spectrum of deoxygenated blood. The delivery fiber had an attached fiber optic ultrasound sensor positioned directly adjacent to it, so that its spatial position could be tracked by receiving transmissions from the ultrasound imaging probe. This study provides strong indications that PA imaging in combination with ultrasonic tracking could be useful for detecting the human placental vasculature during minimally invasive fetal surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological tissues", "Deoxygenated blood", "Minimally invasive", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Postoperative complications", "Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome", "Ultrasound imaging", "Ultrasound sensors", "Algorithms", "Female", "Fetoscopes", "Fetoscopy", "Humans", "Photoacoustic Techniques", "Placenta", "Pregnancy", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947591475", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36337500900": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "36337500900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57188642825": {"Name": "Nikitichev D.I.", "AuthorID": "57188642825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003418009": {"Name": "Mosse C.A.", "AuthorID": "7003418009", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.C.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55840844300": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "55840844300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56038489100": {"Name": "Maneas E.", "AuthorID": "56038489100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56037206400": {"Name": "Dos Santos G.S.", "AuthorID": "56037206400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "7006218373": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "7006218373", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospitals KU Leuven"}}}
