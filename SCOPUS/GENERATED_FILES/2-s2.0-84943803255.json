To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of RF as a test for RA in primary care and its impact on referral times using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Methods. We identified all patients with a first RF test recorded in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2008 and those diagnosed with RA within 2 years of testing. We calculated likelihood ratios (LRs), sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of RF for a diagnosis of RA. We compared time to hospital referral in those testing positive and negative using Kaplan-Meier failure curves and log-rank tests. Results. Of 62 436 first RF tests, 4679 (7.5%) were positive. There were 1753 incident cases of RA, of which 57.8% were seropositive. The positive LR for RF was 9.5 (95% CI 9.0, 10.0) and the negative LR was 0.5 (95% CI 0.4, 0.5). Sensitivity and specificity were 57.8% (95% CI 55.4%, 60.1%) and 93.9% (95% CI 93.7%, 94.1%) and the positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 21.4% (95% CI 20.3%, 22.6%) and 98.7% (95% CI 98.6%, 98.8%), respectively. Median time to first hospital contact after the first RF test in those with seropositive vs seronegative results was 54 days (95% CI 49, 58) vs 150 (95% CI 147, 152).Conclusion. Only 2.8% of patients undergoing RF testing were diagnosed with RA, suggesting that RF is used to screen patients with musculoskeletal symptoms rather than those with more specific features of RA. A positive RF test may be helpful in diagnosing RA in primary care but performs badly in excluding RA and may delay referral.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Primary care", "Rheumatoid arthritis", "Rheumatoid factor", "Sensitivity", "Specificity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943803255", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57198654397": {"Name": "Miller A.", "AuthorID": "57198654397", "AffiliationID": "60170322, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7004223894": {"Name": "Nightingale A.L.", "AuthorID": "7004223894", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "54987067100": {"Name": "Sammon C.J.", "AuthorID": "54987067100", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "16936030100": {"Name": "Mchugh N.J.", "AuthorID": "16936030100", "AffiliationID": "60000080", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Disease"}, "36840707700": {"Name": "Mahtani K.R.", "AuthorID": "36840707700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Health Care Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7006060216": {"Name": "Holt T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006060216", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Health Care Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7003619596": {"Name": "Luqmani R.A.", "AuthorID": "7003619596", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Science, University of Oxford"}}}
