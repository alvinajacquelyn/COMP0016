Various surgical strategies are available but treatment remains challenging and patients often require more than one surgical procedure. This study evaluated whether smaller surgical approaches and newer reconstructive methods impacted the surgical and clinical outcomes of patients undergoing repeat surgery. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the medical records of consecutive patients who underwent surgery for a spheno-orbital meningioma at a single tertiary centre between 2005 and 2016. We recorded procedural details and analysed complications, postoperative visual status and patient-reported cosmetic outcome. Results: Thirty-four procedures were performed in 31 patients (M:F 12:22, median age 49 years) including 19 (56%) primary operations and 15 (44%) repeat procedures. Seven patients (20.5%) had a pterional craniotomy, 19 (56%) had a standard orbitozygomatic craniotomy and 8 (23.5%) underwent a modified mini-orbitozygomatic craniotomy. Calvarial reconstruction was required in 19 cases with a variety of techniques used including titanium mesh (63%), PEEK (26%) and split calvarial bone graft (5%). Total tumour resection (Simpson grade I\u2013II) was significantly higher in patients undergoing primary surgery compared with those having repeat surgery (41% and 0%, respectively; p = 0.0036). Complications occurred in 14 cases (41%). Proptosis improved in all patients and visual acuity improved or remained stable in 93% of patients. Cosmetic outcome measures were obtained for 18 patients (1 = very poor; 5 = excellent): 1\u20132, 0%; 3, 33%; 4, 28%; 5, 39%. Tumour recurrence requiring further surgery occurred in four patients (12%). There was no significant difference in clinical outcomes between patients undergoing primary or repeat surgery. Conclusion: Spheno-orbital meningiomas are highly complex tumours. Surgical approaches should be tailored to the patient but good clinical and cosmetic outcomes may be achieved with a smaller craniotomy and custom-made implants, irrespective of whether the operation is the patient\u2019s first procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmetic outcome", "Meningioma", "Orbitozygomatic craniotomy", "Spheno-orbital meningioma", "Visual outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Craniotomy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Meningeal Neoplasms", "Meningioma", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Orbital Neoplasms", "Postoperative Complications", "Sphenoid Bone", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068148220", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36983191400": {"Name": "Shapey J.", "AuthorID": "36983191400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "57204720061": {"Name": "Jung J.", "AuthorID": "57204720061", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "57200941256": {"Name": "Barkas K.", "AuthorID": "57200941256", "AffiliationID": "60050597", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Hellenic Red Cross Hospital"}, "6701805797": {"Name": "Gullan R.", "AuthorID": "6701805797", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "6602538165": {"Name": "Barazi S.", "AuthorID": "6602538165", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "12240975800": {"Name": "Thomas N.W.", "AuthorID": "12240975800", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "7102498971": {"Name": "Bentley R.", "AuthorID": "7102498971", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, King\u2019s College Hospital"}, "24765852400": {"Name": "Huppa C.", "AuthorID": "24765852400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, King\u2019s College Hospital"}}}
