This study determined the effects of early versus delayed treatment (DT) with subcutaneous interferon (sc IFN) \u03b2-1a 44 \u03bcg in patients with an FCDE up to 60 months postrandomisation. MethodsPatients who completed the 24-month double-blind REFLEX (REbif FLEXible dosing in early MS) study entered an extension (REFLEXION, REbif FLEXible dosing in early MS extensION): patients initially randomised to sc IFN \u03b2-1a and not reaching clinically definite MS (clinically definite MS, CDMS (second attack or sustained Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score increase)) continued original treatment (three times weekly (tiw) or once weekly (qw)); placebo patients switched to tiw (DT); patients with CDMS switched to tiw. Clinical, MRI and adverse event data up to month 60 are reported. Results402/517 (77.8%) REFLEX patients entered REFLEXION (DT, n=133; tiw, n=127; qw, n=142). At month 60, cumulative probability of CDMS was: DT 44.6%; qw 40.7% (nominal p=0.084 vs DT); tiw 39.2% (nominal p=0.032 vs DT). Cumulative probability of McDonald MS conversion (CDMS or new MRI activity) at month 60 was also reduced for tiw versus DT (nominal p<0.001). At month 60, mean cumulative numbers of new T2, gadolinium-enhancing and T1 hypointense lesions were lower with sc IFN \u03b2-1a qw (nominal p<0.05) and tiw versus DT (nominal p<0.001); T2 and T1 hypointense lesion volume change was lower for sc IFN \u03b2-1a tiw versus DT (nominal p<0.01). Treatment was well tolerated; fewer patients receiving tiw versus qw were positive for neutralising or binding antibodies. ConclusionsOver 5 years in patients presenting with an FCDE, early sc IFN \u03b2-1a tiw administration versus DT prolonged time to CDMS and McDonald MS, and reduced overall MRI activity.
