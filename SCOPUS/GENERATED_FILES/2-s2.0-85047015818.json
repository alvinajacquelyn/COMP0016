Recently Wang et al. (2016) showed that theta-band (3\u20137 Hz) brain oscillations within the right temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ) and brain regions coding for motor/body schema contribute to the process of perspective-taking. Using a similar paradigm, we set out to unravel the extended functional brain network in detail. Increasing the angle between self and other perspective was accompanied by longer reaction times and increases in theta power within rTPJ, right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Using Granger-causality, we showed that lateral PFC and ACC exert top-down influence over rTPJ, indicative of executive control processes required for managing conflicts between self and other perspectives. Finally, we quantified patterns of whole-brain phase coupling in relation to the rTPJ. Results suggest that rTPJ increases its theta-band phase synchrony with brain regions involved in mentalizing and regions coding for motor/body schema; whilst decreasing synchrony to visual regions. Implications for neurocognitive models are discussed, and it is proposed that rTPJ acts as a \u2018hub\u2019 to route bottom-up visual information to internal representations of the self during perspective-taking, co-ordinated by theta-band oscillations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MEG", "Oscillations", "Perspective taking", "Social cognition", "Synchrony", "Theta"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cortical Synchronization", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Mentalization", "Nerve Net", "Social Perception", "Theta Rhythm", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047015818", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57191621146": {"Name": "Seymour R.A.", "AuthorID": "57191621146", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Science, Macquarie University"}, "54418125200": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "54418125200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Brain Centre, School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University"}, "6701436401": {"Name": "Rippon G.", "AuthorID": "6701436401", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Brain Centre, School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University"}, "8905196800": {"Name": "Kessler K.", "AuthorID": "8905196800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Brain Centre, School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University"}}}
