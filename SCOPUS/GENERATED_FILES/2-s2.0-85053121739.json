Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Introduction Many patients now turn to the internet as a resource for healthcare information and advice. However, patients' use of the internet to manage their health has been positioned as a potential source of strain on the doctor-patient relationship in primary care. The current evidence about what happens when internet-derived health information is introduced during consultations has relied on qualitative data derived from interview or questionnaire studies. The 'Harnessing resources from the internet to maximise outcomes from GP consultations (HaRI)' study combines questionnaire, interview and video-recorded consultation data to address this issue more fully. Methods and analysis Three data collection methods are employed: preconsultation patient questionnaires, video-recorded consultations between general practitioners (GP) and patients, and semistructured interviews with GPs and patients. We seek to recruit 10 GPs practising in Southeast England. We aim to collect up to 30 patient questionnaires and video-recorded consultations per GP, yielding up to 300. Up to 30 patients (approximately three per participating GP) will be selected for interviews sampled for a wide range of sociodemographic characteristics, and a variety of ways the use of, or information from, the internet was present or absent during their consultation. We will interview all 10 participating GPs about their views of online health information, reflecting on their own usage of online information during consultations and their patients' references to online health information. Descriptive, conversation and thematic analysis will be used respectively for the patient questionnaires, video-recorded consultations and interviews. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the London-Camden & Kings Cross Research Ethics Committee. Alongside journal publications, dissemination activities include the creation of a toolkit to be shared with patients and doctors, to guide discussions of material from the internet in consultations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["family practice", "general practice consultations", "physician-patient relations", "primary health care", "video-recording conversation analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Female", "General Practitioners", "Health Resources", "Humans", "Internet", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Patient Education as Topic", "Qualitative Research", "Referral and Consultation", "Research Design", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053121739", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55224337000": {"Name": "Seguin M.", "AuthorID": "55224337000", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Chronic Conditions, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57215041517": {"Name": "Hall L.", "AuthorID": "57215041517", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EHealth Unit, Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7202670002": {"Name": "Murray E.", "AuthorID": "7202670002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EHealth Unit, Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.A.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EHealth Unit, Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "35727527600": {"Name": "Atherton H.", "AuthorID": "35727527600", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Academic Primary Care, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "10041373600": {"Name": "Barnes R.", "AuthorID": "10041373600", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "6602558835": {"Name": "Leydon G.", "AuthorID": "6602558835", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "7201777281": {"Name": "Pope C.", "AuthorID": "7201777281", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7003768248": {"Name": "Ziebland S.", "AuthorID": "7003768248", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}}}
