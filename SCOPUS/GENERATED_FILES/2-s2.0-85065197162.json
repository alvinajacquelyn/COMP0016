Multiple posttranslational modifications may affect the structure and function of \u03b1-synuclein. Mass spectrometry-based analysis may be useful for the characterization and quantitation of \u03b1-synuclein forms, but has proven challenging, mainly due to the insolubility of Lewy bodies in aqueous buffer. In the present study, we developed a novel method by combining differential solubilization with immunoprecipitation and targeted proteomics using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Brain tissue homogenization and sample preparation were modified to facilitate analysis of soluble, detergent-soluble, and detergent-insoluble protein fractions (Lewy body-enriched). The method was used to compare \u03b1-synuclein forms from cingulate cortex (affected) and occipital cortex (unaffected) in two study sets of PD patients and controls. We identified 20 modified \u03b1-synuclein variants, including species with N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal truncations at amino acids 103 and 119. The levels of \u03b1-synuclein forms Ac-\u03b1-syn1-6, \u03b1-syn13-21, \u03b1-syn35-43, \u03b1-syn46-58, \u03b1-syn61-80, and \u03b1-syn81-96 except \u03b1-syn103-119 were significantly increased in PD cingulate region compared to controls in the Lewy body-enriched \u03b1-synuclein fraction. In the soluble fraction, only Ac-\u03b1-syn1-6 was significantly increased in PD compared to controls. None of the detected \u03b1-synuclein variants were Lewy body-specific, but acetylated forms should be examined further as potential biomarkers for abnormal \u03b1-synuclein accumulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lewy bodies", "mass spectrometry", "parallel reaction monitoring", "Parkinson's disease", "\u03b1-synuclein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "alpha-Synuclein", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Autopsy", "Carbon Isotopes", "Case-Control Studies", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Female", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Isotope Labeling", "Lewy Bodies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nitrogen Isotopes", "Occipital Lobe", "Parkinson Disease", "Solubility", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065197162", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57213442393": {"Name": "Bhattacharjee P.", "AuthorID": "57213442393", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "25224623900": {"Name": "\u00d6hrfelt A.", "AuthorID": "25224623900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6603361018": {"Name": "Brinkmalm A.", "AuthorID": "6603361018", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "6602721075": {"Name": "Lashley T.", "AuthorID": "6602721075", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank for Neurological Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
