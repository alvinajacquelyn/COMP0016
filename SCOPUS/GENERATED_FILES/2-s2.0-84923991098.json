Within these cell clusters, motor neurons receive afferent input and project their axons out to muscle targets. The molecular mechanisms that position motor neurons in the neural tube remain poorly understood. The floor plate produces several types of guidance cues with well-known roles in attracting and repelling axons, including the Slit family of chemorepellents via their Robo receptors, and Netrin1 via its DCC attractive receptor. In the present study we found that Islet1+ motor neuron cell bodies invaded the floor plate of Robo1/2 double mutant mouse embryos or Slit1/2/3 triple mutants. Misplaced neurons were born in their normal progenitor column, but then migrated tangentially into the ventral midline. Robo1 and 2 receptor expression in motor neurons was confirmed by reporter gene staining and anti-Robo antibody labeling. Mis-positioned motor neurons projected their axons longitudinally within the floor plate, and failed to reach their normal exit points. To test for potential counteracting ventral attractive signals, we examined Netrin-1 and DCC mutants, and found that motor neurons shifted dorsally in the hindbrain and spinal cord, suggesting that Netrin-1/DCC signaling normally attracts motor neurons closer to the floor plate. Our results show that motor neurons are actively migrating cells, and are normally trapped in a static position by Slit/Robo repulsion and Netrin-1/DCC attraction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Floor plate", "Migration", "Motor neuron", "Netrin/DCC", "Slit/Robo"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Axons", "Cell Body", "Cell Movement", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Immunohistochemistry", "LIM-Homeodomain Proteins", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Motor Neurons", "Mutation", "Nerve Growth Factors", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Receptors, Cell Surface", "Receptors, Immunologic", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription Factors", "Tumor Suppressor Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923991098", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55686381100": {"Name": "Kim M.", "AuthorID": "55686381100", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada"}, "56471829000": {"Name": "Fontelonga T.", "AuthorID": "56471829000", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada"}, "52564397900": {"Name": "Roesener A.P.", "AuthorID": "52564397900", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada"}, "56470997500": {"Name": "Lee H.", "AuthorID": "56470997500", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada"}, "57205702286": {"Name": "Gurung S.", "AuthorID": "57205702286", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada"}, "57188834377": {"Name": "Mendonca P.R.F.", "AuthorID": "57188834377", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada"}, "6602818064": {"Name": "Mastick G.S.", "AuthorID": "6602818064", "AffiliationID": "60001769", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Nevada"}}}
