Zanasi.We study rewriting for equational theories in the context of symmetric monoidal categories where there is a separable Frobenius monoid on each object. These categories, also called hypergraph categories, are increasingly relevant: Frobenius structures recently appeared in cross-disciplinary applications, including the study of quantum processes, dynamical systems and natural language processing. In this work we give a combinatorial characterisation of arrows of a free hypergraph category as cospans of labelled hypergraphs and establish a precise correspondence between rewriting modulo Frobenius structure on the one hand and double-pushout rewriting of hypergraphs on the other. This interpretation allows to use results on hypergraphs to ensure decidability of confluence for rewriting in a free hypergraph category. Our results generalise previous approaches where only categories generated by a single object (props) were considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-disciplinary", "Double pushout rewriting", "Equational theory", "Hypergraph", "Monoidal categories", "Quantum process", "Rewriting modulo", "Single object"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045550084", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"6507161816": {"Name": "Zanasi F.", "AuthorID": "6507161816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
