In this paper, we revisit the control of this molecule. Potential surfaces for the complete spin-orbit manifold of IBr states dissociating into the ground and first excited states of the constituent atoms have been calculated at the multi-reference configuration interaction (MRCI) level of theory as a function of applied field. Both the strength and direction of field have been taken into account and it is seen how the avoided crossing between the states thought to be key in the control mechanism shift as a function of field strength. These surfaces will enable full calculations of the molecule in the pump-control field. Preliminary dynamics calculations with the field placed along the molecular axis show that a Hamiltonian including all 36-states agrees with earlier results and is able to model the basic features of the control. However, just like earlier results, this restricted model is not able to reproduce the timescale of the control.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Avoided crossings", "Control mechanism", "Dynamics calculations", "First excited state", "Multi reference configuration interactions", "Potential surfaces", "Restricted models", "Spin-orbit manifolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068546468", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"23670831000": {"Name": "Sanz-Sanz C.", "AuthorID": "23670831000", "AffiliationID": "60026796", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica F\u00edsica Aplicada, M\u00f3dulo 14, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "7006625328": {"Name": "Worth G.A.", "AuthorID": "7006625328", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
