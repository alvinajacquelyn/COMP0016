All rights reserved.Achieving a truly sustainable energy transition requires progress across multiple dimensions beyond climate change mitigation goals. This article reviews and synthesizes results from disparate strands of literature on the coeffects of mitigation to inform climate policy choices at different governance levels. The literature documents many potential cobenefits of mitigation for nonclimate objectives, such as human health and energy security, but little is known about their overall welfare implications. Integrated model studies highlight that climate policies as part of well-designed policy packages reduce the overall cost of achieving multiple sustainability objectives. The incommensurability and uncertainties around the quantification of coeffects become, however, increasingly pervasive the more the perspective shifts from sectoral and local to economy wide and global, the more objectives are analyzed, and the more the results are expressed in economic rather than nonmonetary terms. Different strings of evidence highlight the role and importance of energy demand reductions for realizing synergies across multiple sustainability objectives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air quality", "Cobenefits", "Energy demand reduction", "Energy efficiency", "Energy security", "Multiple objectives", "Welfare-theoretical framework"], "IndexKeywords": ["Climate change mitigation", "Cobenefits", "Energy demands", "Global climate changes", "Multiple-objectives", "Sustainability objectives", "Theoretical framework", "Welfare implications"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946828546", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"36983300000": {"Name": "Von Stechow C.", "AuthorID": "36983300000", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics of Climate Change, Technical University Berlin"}, "8513127600": {"Name": "Minx J.C.", "AuthorID": "8513127600", "AffiliationID": "60102536", "AffiliationName": "Hertie School of Governance"}, "55881072300": {"Name": "Kriegler E.", "AuthorID": "55881072300", "AffiliationID": "60025182", "AffiliationName": "Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"}, "55868364000": {"Name": "Edenhofer O.", "AuthorID": "55868364000", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics of Climate Change, Technical University Berlin"}, "12803129900": {"Name": "McCollum D.", "AuthorID": "12803129900", "AffiliationID": "60019497", "AffiliationName": "Energy Program, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis"}, "6602435618": {"Name": "Riahi K.", "AuthorID": "6602435618", "AffiliationID": "60019663", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Thermal Engineering, Graz University of Technology"}, "36625509200": {"Name": "Jewell J.", "AuthorID": "36625509200", "AffiliationID": "60019497", "AffiliationName": "Energy Program, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis"}, "7003501910": {"Name": "Van Vuuren D.P.", "AuthorID": "7003501910", "AffiliationID": "60018815, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Environmental Sciences, Utrecht University"}, "55747980500": {"Name": "Robledo-Abad C.", "AuthorID": "55747980500", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Systems Science, USYS TdLab, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "6701785583": {"Name": "Hertwich E.", "AuthorID": "6701785583", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Ecology Programme, Department of Energy and Process Engineering, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "21744127000": {"Name": "Tavoni M.", "AuthorID": "21744127000", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management and Economics, Politecnico di Milano"}, "6602877030": {"Name": "Mirasgedis S.", "AuthorID": "6602877030", "AffiliationID": "60011619", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Environmental Research and Sustainable Development, National Observatory of Athens"}, "55832706700": {"Name": "Lah O.", "AuthorID": "55832706700", "AffiliationID": "113811076", "AffiliationName": "Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy"}, "7202869544": {"Name": "Roy J.", "AuthorID": "7202869544", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics and Global Change Program, Jadavpur University"}, "6602891448": {"Name": "Mulugetta Y.", "AuthorID": "6602891448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "55902181100": {"Name": "Dubash N.K.", "AuthorID": "55902181100", "AffiliationID": "60069578", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Policy Research"}, "57196802707": {"Name": "Bollen J.", "AuthorID": "57196802707", "AffiliationID": "60015113", "AffiliationName": "CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis"}, "6602952117": {"Name": "\u00dcrge-Vorsatz D.", "AuthorID": "6602952117", "AffiliationID": "60009563", "AffiliationName": "Center for Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Policy, Central European University"}}}
