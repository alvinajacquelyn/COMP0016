These range from genetics at what might be regarded as one end of the spectrum to anthropology at the other. In this chapter we refer to biological, psychological and social mechanisms in full realization that this represents a kind of shorthand for the gamut of discipline-based inputs into any comprehensive understanding of epilepsy and its effects. Our purpose is not to review this extensive and fragmented literature (again), but to explore the possibility of moving on conceptually and scientifically and to offer some empirical illustrations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015062165", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6701655886": {"Name": "Scambler G.", "AuthorID": "6701655886", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sociological Theory and Research on Health, University College London"}, "57193580016": {"Name": "Afentouli P.", "AuthorID": "57193580016", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8412764200": {"Name": "Selai C.", "AuthorID": "8412764200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
