This commentary focuses specifically on the association between physical activity or exercise and infertility, given the equivocal evidence summarized in the review by Rossi and colleagues. Several methodologic issues related to physical activity and infertility are discussed, including defining the components of physical activity that research studies assess in research studies (eg, type, intensity, frequency, duration), considering the optimal way to measure physical activity, and investigating important effect modifiers, including age and body mass index. Researchers should also consider sedentary behavior as another potentially important, unexplored, modifiable behavior that may be associated with infertility. Given that unexplained infertility remains of widespread global concern, identifying modifiable risk factors and how much influence they have on infertility remains an important area for research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conception", "exercise", "fertility", "in vitro fertilization", "pregnancy", "recreational activity", "sedentary behavior"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978197351", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7006414128": {"Name": "Evenson K.", "AuthorID": "7006414128", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "55868344300": {"Name": "Hesketh K.", "AuthorID": "55868344300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
