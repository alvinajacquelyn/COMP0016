Symptoms progress over 15\u201320 years, and there are currently no diseasemodifying therapies. The causative genetic mutation is an expanded CAG repeat in the HTT gene encoding the Huntingtin protein, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In this chapter we discuss the genetics, clinical presentation, and management of this condition, as well as new data from large-scale clinical research studies on the natural history of HD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chorea", "Genetics", "Huntington\u2019s disease", "Management", "Natural history", "Symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Huntington Disease"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941144186", "SubjectAreas": [["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56825117700": {"Name": "Ghosh R.", "AuthorID": "56825117700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
