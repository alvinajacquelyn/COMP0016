The load-capacity model integrates the effects of both FM and FFM to improve disease-risk prediction. We aimed to derive age-, gender-and BMI-specific reference curves of load-capacity model indices in an adult population (\u226518 years). Design Cross-sectional study. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was used to measure FM, FFM, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) and truncal fat mass (TrFM). Two metabolic load-capacity indices were calculated: ratio of FM (kg) to FFM (kg) and ratio of TrFM (kg) to ASM (kg). Age-standardised reference curves, stratified by gender and BMI (<25\u00b70 kg/m2, 25\u00b70-29\u00b79 kg/m2, \u226530\u00b70 kg/m2), were constructed using an LMS approach. Percentiles of the reference curves were 5th, 15th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 85th and 95th. Setting Secondary analysis of data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Subjects The population included 6580 females and 6656 males. Results The unweighted proportions of obesity in males and females were 25\u00b75 % and 34\u00b77 %, respectively. The average values of both FM:FFM and TrFM:ASM were greater in female and obese subjects. Gender and BMI influenced the shape of the association of age with FM:FFM and TrFM:ASM, as a curvilinear relationship was observed in female and obese subjects. Menopause appeared to modify the steepness of the reference curves of both indices. Conclusions This is a novel risk-stratification approach integrating the effects of high adiposity and low muscle mass which may be particularly useful to identify cases of sarcopenic obesity and improve disease-risk prediction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Appendicular skeletal mass", "Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry", "Fat mass", "Fat-free mass", "NHANES", "Reference curves", "Truncal fat mass"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adiposity", "Adult", "Algorithms", "Body Mass Index", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Nutrition Surveys", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Prevalence", "Risk Assessment", "Sarcopenia", "Sex Factors", "United States", "Weight-Bearing", "Whole Body Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926418186", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"14623120800": {"Name": "Siervo M.", "AuthorID": "14623120800", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Human Nutrition Research Centre, Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "26531771600": {"Name": "Prado C.M.", "AuthorID": "26531771600", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural, Division of Human Nutrition, University of Alberta"}, "57208814854": {"Name": "Mire E.", "AuthorID": "57208814854", "AffiliationID": "60021235", "AffiliationName": "Pennington Biomedical Research Center"}, "35787985100": {"Name": "Broyles S.", "AuthorID": "35787985100", "AffiliationID": "60021235", "AffiliationName": "Pennington Biomedical Research Center"}, "57203215771": {"Name": "Heymsfield S.", "AuthorID": "57203215771", "AffiliationID": "60021235", "AffiliationName": "Pennington Biomedical Research Center"}, "7005235864": {"Name": "Katzmarzyk P.T.", "AuthorID": "7005235864", "AffiliationID": "60021235", "AffiliationName": "Pennington Biomedical Research Center"}, "55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.C.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
