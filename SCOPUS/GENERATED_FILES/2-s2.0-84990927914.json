However, we know very little about the antigenic characteristics of OECs in situ within the adult and developing human olfactory bulb and nerve roots. To address this gap in knowledge we undertook an immunocytochemical analysis of the 11\u201319 pcw human foetal olfactory system. Human foetal OECs in situ possessed important differences compared to rodents in the expression of key surface markers. P75NTR was not observed in OECs but was strongly expressed by human foetal Schwann cells and perineurial olfactory nerve fibroblasts surrounding OECs. We define OECs throughout the 11\u201319 pcw human olfactory system as S100/vimentin/SOX10+ with low expression of GFAP. Our results suggest that P75NTR is a robust marker that could be utilised with cell sorting techniques to generate enriched OEC cultures by first removing P75NTR expressing Schwann cells and fibroblasts, and subsequently to isolate OECs after P75NTR upregulation in vitro. O4 and PSA-NCAM were not found to be suitable surface antigens for OEC purification owing to their ambiguous and heterogeneous expression. Our results highlight the importance of corroborating cell markers when translating cell therapies from animal models to the clinic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Foetal", "Human", "Immunocytochemistry", "OEC", "Olfactory bulb", "Olfactory ensheathing cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fetal Development", "Fetus", "Humans", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nestin", "Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1", "Neuroglia", "Olfactory Pathways", "Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor", "Sialic Acids", "SOXE Transcription Factors", "Tubulin", "Vimentin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990927914", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"57188750359": {"Name": "Oprych K.", "AuthorID": "57188750359", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain, Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57191489775": {"Name": "Cotfas D.", "AuthorID": "57191489775", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain, Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "23049327300": {"Name": "Choi D.", "AuthorID": "23049327300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
