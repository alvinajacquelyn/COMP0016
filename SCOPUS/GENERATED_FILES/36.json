Using variational techniques, suitable uniform estimates (both pathwise and in expectation) and some compactness results, well-posedness is proved under the classical Leray\u2013Lions conditions on \u03b3 and with no restrictive smoothness or growth assumptions on \u03b2. The operator B is assumed to be Hilbert\u2013Schmidt and to satisfy some classical Lipschitz conditions in the second variable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Continuous dependence", "Divergence", "Doubly nonlinear stochastic equation", "Existence of solutions", "Multiplicative noise", "Variational approach"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016643642", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57056210800": {"Name": "Scarpa L.", "AuthorID": "57056210800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
