Altered microbial flora may occur and contribute to the initiation, progression or severity of disease. However, dysbiosis could also be secondary to the disease or immunosuppressive therapy. Here we consider how lessons could be learned from gastroenterology, a speciality where dysbiosis is strongly implicated in disease mechanism and treatment. This could be highly relevant to molecular pathology of skin in SSc and could drive the inflammatory gene signature observed in some skin biopsies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dysbiosis", "Gastrointestinal Microbiome", "Humans", "Microbiota", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Skin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063597483", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57202223898": {"Name": "Murray C.", "AuthorID": "57202223898", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
