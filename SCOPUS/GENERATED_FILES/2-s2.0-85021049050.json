Methods: People with type 1 diabetes recruited by the EURODIAB Prospective Complications Study who had normal QTc were examined at baseline and after 7 years with standardized methods (n = 1415; mean age \u00b1 SD 32.1 \u00b1 9.6 years; diabetes duration 14.2 \u00b1 8.8 years). Hypoglycemic episodes were assessed by a questionnaire. QTc was calculated according to Bazett\u2019s formula. In logistic regression analysis, we examined the role of severe hypoglycemia (none, 1\u20132, or 3 and more episodes/year) on the cumulative incidence of prolonged QTc, independently of age, sex, HbA1c, blood pressure, BMI, physical activity, distal symmetrical and autonomic neuropathy. Results: In total, 264/1415 (17%) patients had incident prolonged QTc. Compared to those with persistently normal QTc, a greater proportion of incident cases had 3 and more hypoglycemic episodes at baseline (16.3 vs 11.2%, p = 0.03) and after 7 years (15.2 vs 9.6%, p = 0.01). In logistic regression analysis, 3 or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia at baseline did not increase cumulative incidence of prolonged QTc (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.88\u20132.03). By contrast, severe hypoglycemia at the follow-up examination was associated with higher incidence of QTc prolongation (OR 1.68, 1.09\u20132.58), which reverted to not significant after adjustment for diabetic neuropathy. Conclusions: Severe hypoglycemia was not associated with incidence QTc prolongation in type 1 diabetic patients from the EURODIAB PCS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complications", "Hypoglycemia", "QTc", "Surveys"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Pressure", "Cohort Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetic Angiopathies", "Diabetic Neuropathies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hypoglycemia", "Incidence", "Long QT Syndrome", "Male", "Severity of Illness Index", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021049050", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"6508124682": {"Name": "Amione C.", "AuthorID": "6508124682", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "55979777900": {"Name": "Giunti S.", "AuthorID": "55979777900", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "8950323400": {"Name": "Fornengo P.", "AuthorID": "8950323400", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "23466342400": {"Name": "Barutta F.", "AuthorID": "23466342400", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "55991365900": {"Name": "Gruden G.", "AuthorID": "55991365900", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "57216239082": {"Name": "Bruno G.", "AuthorID": "57216239082", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "57209976040": {"Name": "Soedamah-Muthu S.S.", "AuthorID": "57209976040", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Division of Human Nutrition, Wageningen University"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public-Health, University College London"}, "7202037539": {"Name": "Fuller J.H.", "AuthorID": "7202037539", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public-Health, University College London"}}}
