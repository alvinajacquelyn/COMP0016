This study appealed to \u2018interoceptive inference\u2019, under the FEP, to seek new insights into autonomic (dys)function and brain\u2013body integration by examining the relationship between cardiac interoception and autonomic cardiac control in healthy controls and patients with forms of orthostatic intolerance (OI); to (i) seek empirical support for interoceptive inference and (ii) delineate if this relationship was sensitive to increased interoceptive prediction error in OI patients during head-up tilt (HUT)/symptom provocation. Measures of interoception and heart rate variability (HRV) were recorded whilst supine and during HUT in healthy controls (N = 20), postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS, N = 20) and vasovagal syncope (VVS, N = 20) patients. Compared to controls, interoceptive accuracy was reduced in both OI groups. Healthy controls' interoceptive sensibility positively correlated with HRV whilst supine. Conversely, both OI groups' interoceptive awareness negatively correlated with HRV during HUT. Our pilot study offers initial support for interoceptive inference and suggests OI cohorts share a central pathophysiology underlying interoceptive deficits expressed across distinct cardiovascular autonomic pathophysiology. From a predictive coding perspective, OI patients' data indicates a failure to attenuate/modulate ascending interoceptive prediction errors, reinforced by the concomitant failure to engage autonomic reflexes during HUT. Our findings offer a potential framework for conceptualising how the human nervous system maintains homeostasis and how both central and autonomic processes are ultimately implicated in dysautonomia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active inference", "Autonomic nervous system", "Dysautonomia", "Free-energy principle", "Heart rate variability", "Homeostasis", "Interoception", "Interoceptive (active) inference", "Predictive coding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Fourier Analysis", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Interoception", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Orthostatic Intolerance", "Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome", "Syncope, Vasovagal", "Tilt-Table Test"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040237877", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"54796896600": {"Name": "Owens A.P.", "AuthorID": "54796896600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCL NHS Trust"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.J.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "35237633400": {"Name": "Low D.A.", "AuthorID": "35237633400", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "35393637700": {"Name": "Mathias C.J.", "AuthorID": "35393637700", "AffiliationID": "106566221", "AffiliationName": "Hospital of St John & St Elizabeth"}, "7006731538": {"Name": "Critchley H.D.", "AuthorID": "7006731538", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, University of Sussex"}}}
