These emotional difficulties contribute to poor social functioning and problems with relationships. The existing literature includes a broad range of studies, many of which have utilised self-report measures, but experimental studies of emotions in eating disorders are still limited. The primary aim of this paper is to highlight gaps in the clinical research on emotions in eating disorders, focusing on experimental investigations from our lab and highlighting potentially useful future directions for further basic research and its translation into new developments in treatment and prevention. Recent findings using experimental paradigms to study the expression of emotions along with neuroimaging research exploring differences in facial emotion processing are discussed, and clinical implications are presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eating disorders", "Emotions", "Experimental", "Positive psychology", "Quality of life", "Self-report"], "IndexKeywords": ["Eating Disorders", "Emotions", "Humans", "Self Concept", "Social Adjustment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925619520", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8384655900": {"Name": "Tchanturia K.", "AuthorID": "8384655900", "AffiliationID": "60104463", "AffiliationName": "Illia State University"}, "53979653700": {"Name": "Dapelo M.A.M.", "AuthorID": "53979653700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine, King\u2019s College London"}, "35179313900": {"Name": "Harrison A.", "AuthorID": "35179313900", "AffiliationID": "112667973", "AffiliationName": "Ellern Mede Centre for Eating Disorders"}, "24483232300": {"Name": "Hambrook D.", "AuthorID": "24483232300", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Southwark Psychological Therapies Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
