GTT represent a spectrum of neoplasms that originate from the extravillous trophoblast and have variable malignant potential. These include choriocarcinoma (CC), Placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT) and Epitheloid trophoblastic tumour (ETT). Among tumour like conditions exaggerated placental site reaction (EPSR) and placental site nodule (s)/plaque (s) are included. The morphological appearances of GTT can be mimicked both by non-malignant tumour-like conditions and also non-gestational tumours with trophoblastic differentiation, adding to the diagnostic dilemma of these already rare tumours. GTT have a favourable prognosis and better response to specific chemotherapeutic regimens when compared to non-gestational malignant genital tract neoplasms, and thus their recognition is important. This article discusses the morphological appearances and immunocytochemistry of these rare tumours along with recent developments in the form of targeted immunotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["choriocarcinoma", "epithelioid trophoblastic tumour", "exaggerated placental site reaction", "immunocytochemistry", "placental site nodule", "placental site trophoblastic tumour"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059743371", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"57208800771": {"Name": "Kaur B.", "AuthorID": "57208800771", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60020416", "AffiliationName": null}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60020416", "AffiliationName": null}}}
