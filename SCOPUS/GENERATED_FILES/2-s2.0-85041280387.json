An electronic database search was conducted on 25th March 2017. Eligible studies were double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials that examined the efficacy of compounds that act primarily as AChEIs or stimulants (administered daily for \u22651 week) on cognitive outcome measures in patients with MS. Where suitable data was reported, we generated effect sizes and corresponding 95% confidence intervals and performed meta-analyses using random-effects models to investigate the effectiveness of these drug types across cognitive domains. Sixteen trials were included in the systematic review, with eleven trials (N = 734 MS patients) providing sufficient data for meta-analysis. Whilst there was only a limited pool of relatively small trials and a number of different compounds, we found that collectively, both AChEIs (donepezil and rivastigmine) and stimulants (methylphenidate, modafinil, l-amphetamine sulfate and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) offered no significant benefits over placebo on measures of processing speed, working memory, verbal fluency, verbal memory, visuospatial memory or executive functioning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors", "Adjunctive pharmacotherapy", "Cognition", "Meta-analysis", "Multiple sclerosis", "Stimulants"], "IndexKeywords": ["Central Nervous System Stimulants", "Cholinesterase Inhibitors", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Humans", "Multiple Sclerosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041280387", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55999264400": {"Name": "Cotter J.", "AuthorID": "55999264400", "AffiliationID": "60112882", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Cognition"}, "57200444795": {"Name": "Talwar A.", "AuthorID": "57200444795", "AffiliationID": "60112882", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Cognition"}, "57197875385": {"Name": "Granger K.", "AuthorID": "57197875385", "AffiliationID": "60112882", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Cognition"}, "36010957200": {"Name": "Muhlert N.", "AuthorID": "36010957200", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, Cardiff University"}}}
