A recent cohort study observed that maternal diabetes in early pregnancy is also associated with psychotic experiences in the general adolescent population. However, it remains unclear whether maternal diabetes in early pregnancy is specifically associated with psychotic experiences, or is generally associated with broader mental health problems, including depressive symptoms in adolescence. The present study investigated the longitudinal associations between maternal diabetes in early pregnancy, and psychotic experiences and depressive symptoms in 10-year-old offspring. Our data were derived from the Tokyo Early Adolescence Survey, a population-based survey of early adolescents (N = 4478) and their primary caregivers. Diabetes in early pregnancy was determined by records in the mother's Maternal and Child Health Handbook, documented during the pregnancy. Psychotic experiences and depressive symptoms were established through self-report by the offspring at 10 years of age. Diabetes in early pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of hallucination in the offspring (auditory hallucination [odds ratio {OR} 4.33, 95% confidence interval {CI} 1.12\u201316.75]; visual hallucination [OR 6.58, 95% CI 1.69\u201325.66]), even after adjusting for depressive symptoms and other covariates. However, the association between maternal diabetes and delusional thoughts was not significant and diabetes in early pregnancy was not associated with adolescent depressive symptoms. Our investigation suggests that maternal diabetes in early pregnancy may specifically affect the risk of hallucinatory experiences in adolescent offspring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Depression", "Diabetes", "Hallucination", "Perinatal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Depression", "Diabetes, Gestational", "Female", "Hallucinations", "Humans", "Japan", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Odds Ratio", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy in Diabetics", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Psychotic Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059046665", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"22036925600": {"Name": "Yamasaki S.", "AuthorID": "22036925600", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "53063099300": {"Name": "Ando S.", "AuthorID": "53063099300", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo"}, "57188725825": {"Name": "Endo K.", "AuthorID": "57188725825", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "57190253447": {"Name": "Morimoto Y.", "AuthorID": "57190253447", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "7402957748": {"Name": "Arai M.", "AuthorID": "7402957748", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "35311924300": {"Name": "Nishida A.", "AuthorID": "35311924300", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "57190249393": {"Name": "Fujikawa S.", "AuthorID": "57190249393", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo"}, "26643019200": {"Name": "Kasai K.", "AuthorID": "26643019200", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "The International Research Center for Neurointelligence (WPI-IRCN) at The University of Tokyo Institutes for Advanced Study (UTIAS), Tokyo, Japan"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "22957853600": {"Name": "Hatch S.L.", "AuthorID": "22957853600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "36961019700": {"Name": "Koike S.", "AuthorID": "36961019700", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "University of Tokyo Institute for Diversity & Adaptation of Human Mind (UTIDAHM), The University of Tokyo"}, "55821156600": {"Name": "Kanata S.", "AuthorID": "55821156600", "AffiliationID": "60029730", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Teikyo University School of Medicine"}, "7006007995": {"Name": "Okado H.", "AuthorID": "7006007995", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Development and Neural Regeneration, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "26538314600": {"Name": "Usami S.", "AuthorID": "26538314600", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Education, The University of Tokyo"}, "7403159918": {"Name": "Furukawa T.A.", "AuthorID": "7403159918", "AffiliationID": "60011001", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Promotion and Human Behavior, Graduate School of Medicine/School of Public Health, Kyoto University"}, "6602340280": {"Name": "Hiraiwa-Hasegawa M.", "AuthorID": "6602340280", "AffiliationID": "60021523", "AffiliationName": "School of Advanced Science, SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies)"}}}
