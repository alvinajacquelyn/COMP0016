EVR is widely used as an anti-neoplastic therapy and more recently in children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). However, no clear correlation exists between EVR use and development of central side effects e.g. depression, anxiety or cognitive impairment. We studied the effects of a 3 weeks administration of EVR in mice chronically treated with betamethasone 21-phosphate disodium (BTM) as a model of depression and cognitive decline. EVR treatment had detrimental effects on depressive- and anxiety-like behavior while improving cognitive performance in both control (untreated) and BTM-treated mice. Such effects were accompanied by an increased hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis. Our results therefore might support the proposed pathological role of mTOR dysregulation in depressive disorders and confirm some previous data on the positive effects of mTOR inhibition in cognitive decline. We also show that EVR, possibly through mTOR inhibition, may be linked to the development of anxiety. The increased hippocampal neurogenesis by EVR might explain its ability to improve cognitive function or protect from cognitive decline. Our findings suggest some caution in the use of EVR, particularly in the developing brain; patients should be carefully monitored for their psychiatric/neurological profiles in any clinical situation where an mTOR inhibitor and in particular EVR is used e.g. cancer treatment, TSC or immunosuppression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Cognitive function", "Depression", "Mice", "MTOR", "Neurogenesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Animals", "Anxiety", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Depression", "Disease Models, Animal", "Everolimus", "Hippocampus", "Learning", "Male", "Memory", "Mice, Inbred DBA", "Neurogenesis", "Random Allocation", "Synapses", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961821201", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57200140760": {"Name": "Russo E.", "AuthorID": "57200140760", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "55761723200": {"Name": "Leo A.", "AuthorID": "55761723200", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "55445876300": {"Name": "Aiello R.", "AuthorID": "55445876300", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "55445873100": {"Name": "Chimirri S.", "AuthorID": "55445873100", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "13806486700": {"Name": "Citraro R.", "AuthorID": "13806486700", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "57201386594": {"Name": "De Sarro G.", "AuthorID": "57201386594", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Science of Health Department, School of Medicine, University of Catanzaro"}, "24170933400": {"Name": "Crupi R.", "AuthorID": "24170933400", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Environmental Science, University of Messina"}, "35492552100": {"Name": "Cuzzocrea S.", "AuthorID": "35492552100", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Environmental Science, University of Messina"}, "35111331300": {"Name": "Lippiello P.", "AuthorID": "35111331300", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Naples Federico II"}, "57052732600": {"Name": "Spiga R.", "AuthorID": "57052732600", "AffiliationID": "60069616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Surgical Sciences, University Magna Graecia of Catanzaro"}, "7006013892": {"Name": "Constanti A.", "AuthorID": "7006013892", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
