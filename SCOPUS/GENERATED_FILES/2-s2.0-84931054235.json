The great healthcare costs and economic burden of HCC dictate proper preventive interventions as well as surveillance and screening programs to decrease disease incidence and allow early diagnosis. HCC treatment outcomes are affected by several variables, including liver function, patient\u2019s performance status, and tumor stage. In line with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging curative treatments, such as surgery or radio-frequency ablation, are indicated in early-stage HCC (BCLC-A), and the noncurative treatments are indicated in intermediate and advanced stages of HCC (BCLC-B, C). Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) represents the treatment of choice for intermediate-stage HCC with Child\u2013Pugh A cirrhosis, and the long-term survival after liver transplantation is inferior to that of early-stage HCCs. In advanced-stage HCC or when complete necrosis is not achieved or early recurrence after TACE develops, individualized treatments such as systemic treatment or combined radiation therapy are indicated. The increasing knowledge of the genomic landscape of HCC and the development of molecular-targeted therapies is heading toward expanding the armamentarium for HCC management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Hepatocellular", "Therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ablation Techniques", "Carcinoma, Hepatocellular", "Chemoembolization, Therapeutic", "Global Health", "Humans", "Incidence", "Surgical Procedures, Operative"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931054235", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6603848797": {"Name": "Mazzoccoli G.", "AuthorID": "6603848797", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, Division of Internal Medicine and Chronobiology Unit, IRCCS Scientific Institute and Regional General Hospital \u201cCasa Sollievo della Sofferenza\u201d"}, "7004704315": {"Name": "Tarquini R.", "AuthorID": "7004704315", "AffiliationID": "60086665", "AffiliationName": "San Giuseppe Hospital"}, "56075047200": {"Name": "Valoriani A.", "AuthorID": "56075047200", "AffiliationID": "60086665", "AffiliationName": "San Giuseppe Hospital"}, "55405948300": {"Name": "Marra F.", "AuthorID": "55405948300", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Florence"}, "6602606185": {"Name": "Oben J.", "AuthorID": "6602606185", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL) \u2013 Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Technology, Nottingham Trent University"}}}
