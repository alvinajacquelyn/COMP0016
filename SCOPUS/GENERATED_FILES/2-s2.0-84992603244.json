These three constructs and the related mediation effect may characterize different psychiatric syndromes other than PSDs. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to baseline data from a longitudinal study of 138 young individuals with a recent-onset psychiatric disorder. Using SEM, we tested the hypothesis that ToM mediates the effect of neurocognition on functioning independent of the level of psychosis risk and the diagnostic category. In the mediation model the bootstrapping estimate revealed a significant indirect effect that was the association of social cognition with neurocognition and with functional outcome. ToM was significantly associated with neurocognition and the path from neurocognition to functioning was no longer significant as soon as the mediator (ToM) was entered into the mediation model consistent with a complete mediation effect through ToM. This mediation was independent of the psychosis-risk status and the psychiatric diagnoses. Our results provide useful information on a young psychiatric sample, in which specific therapeutic interventions have the potential to significantly limit functional disability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Models, Statistical", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Theory of Mind", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992603244", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"55404455500": {"Name": "Francesconi M.", "AuthorID": "55404455500", "AffiliationID": "60121686, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, UCSD"}, "50561834000": {"Name": "Minichino A.", "AuthorID": "50561834000", "AffiliationID": "60121686, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, UCSD"}, "55663573300": {"Name": "Chiaie R.", "AuthorID": "55663573300", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "37064445400": {"Name": "Bersani F.", "AuthorID": "37064445400", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7005127267": {"Name": "Biondi M.", "AuthorID": "7005127267", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "6701917723": {"Name": "Cadenhead K.", "AuthorID": "6701917723", "AffiliationID": "60121686, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, UCSD"}, "55391052300": {"Name": "Carri\u00f3n R.", "AuthorID": "55391052300", "AffiliationID": "60020942", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, Zucker Hillside Hospital"}, "7005903823": {"Name": "Bevilacqua A.", "AuthorID": "7005903823", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Section of Neuroscience, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57191747058": {"Name": "Parisi M.", "AuthorID": "57191747058", "AffiliationID": "118617703", "AffiliationName": "Villa Armonia Nuova"}, "6603636389": {"Name": "Rullo S.", "AuthorID": "6603636389", "AffiliationID": "100458907", "AffiliationName": "Casa di Cura Villa Letizia"}}}
