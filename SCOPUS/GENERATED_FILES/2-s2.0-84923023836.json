All rights reserved.N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) autoantibodies have been reported in people with acute psychosis. We hypothesised that their presence may be implicated in the aetiology of treatment-refractory psychosis. We sought to ascertain the point prevalence of NMDA-R antibody positivity in patients referred to services for treatment-refractory psychosis. We found that 3 (7.0%) of 43 individuals had low positive NMDA-R antibody titres. This suggests that NMDA-R autoantibodies are unlikely to account for a large proportion of treatment-refractory psychosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Autoantibodies", "Drug Resistance", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychotic Disorders", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923023836", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55642378900": {"Name": "Beck K.", "AuthorID": "55642378900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "54389354300": {"Name": "Lally J.", "AuthorID": "54389354300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "35433190700": {"Name": "Shergill S.", "AuthorID": "35433190700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "55774659600": {"Name": "Bloomfield M.", "AuthorID": "55774659600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "7003607616": {"Name": "MacCabe J.", "AuthorID": "7003607616", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "6602176923": {"Name": "Howes O.", "AuthorID": "6602176923", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychosis Studies, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London"}, "6602336142": {"Name": "Gaughran F.", "AuthorID": "6602336142", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "National Psychosis Service, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
