The method is illustrated by applications to two model systems: firstly to the Tangled Nature Model of evolutionary ecology and secondly to a stochastic replicator system. The quasi-stable configurations of the stochastic dynamics are taken as input for a stability analysis of the deterministic mean field approximation of the dynamics. We demonstrate that the largest overlap between the observed configuration and the unstable eigendirections serves as a precursor that allows us to forecast transitions with an efficiency of about 80% even if we only know the couplings matrix describing the dynamics to with 10% accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["A-stability", "Evolutionary ecology", "Forecast transitions", "High-dimensional", "Mean field approximation", "Stable Configuration", "Stochastic dynamics", "Two model systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947247885", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56146400200": {"Name": "Piovani D.", "AuthorID": "56146400200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complexity Science, Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "15048062300": {"Name": "Grujic J.", "AuthorID": "15048062300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complexity Science, Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "56232480400": {"Name": "Jensen H.", "AuthorID": "56232480400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complexity Science, Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}}}
