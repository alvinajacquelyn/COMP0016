This can be regarded as a local analogue of the Iwasawa main conjecture for abelian p-adic Lie extensions of Qp, extending earlier work of Kato for rank one modules and of Benois and Berger for the cyclotomic extension. We show that such an e-isomorphism can be constructed using the 2-variable version of the Perrin-Riou regulator map constructed by the first and third authors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924940142", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"36952170600": {"Name": "Loeffler D.", "AuthorID": "36952170600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Mathematics Institute, Zeeman Building, University of Warwick"}, "6602633734": {"Name": "Venjakob O.", "AuthorID": "6602633734", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Mathematisches Institut, Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg"}, "6508170603": {"Name": "Zerbes S.", "AuthorID": "6508170603", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
