Design research has been criticized as \"solutionist\" i.e. solving problems that don't exist or providing \"quick fixes\" for complex social, political and environmental problems. We respond to this critique by presenting a \"solutionist\" board game used to generate design concepts. Players are given data cards and technology dice, they move around the board by pitching concepts that would support positive aging. We argue that framing concept design as a solutionist game explicitly foregrounds play, irony and the limitations of technological intervention. Three of the game concepts are presented as design fictions in the form of advertisements for products and services that do not exist. The paper argues that design fiction can help create a space for design beyond solutionism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Design fiction", "Older people", "Well being"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concept designs", "Design fictions", "Design research", "Environmental problems", "Older People", "Products and services", "Qualitative study", "Well being"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951205246", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"9242985700": {"Name": "Blythe M.", "AuthorID": "9242985700", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Northumbria University"}, "55782049700": {"Name": "Steane J.", "AuthorID": "55782049700", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Northumbria University"}, "36624284700": {"Name": "Roe J.", "AuthorID": "36624284700", "AffiliationID": "60016418, 60015157", "AffiliationName": "Stockholm Environment Institute, University of York"}, "35727255100": {"Name": "Oliver C.", "AuthorID": "35727255100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "COMPAS, University of Oxford"}}}
