To these ends, it has sought to mobilise the region's untapped resources through policies encouraging these cities' integration and growth. However, the policy and rhetoric of inter-city integration has not yielded concordant material outcomes. Instead, the three separate municipal governments have engaged with the policy agenda not in pursuit of co-operation and integration, but rather to take advantage of otherwise unavailable opportunities to boost their individual economic competitiveness. This paper examines the disjuncture between the rhetoric of inter-city co-operation and the material reality of competition in the Shantou-Chaozhou-Jieyang city-region. The paper takes significance first, in its critical exploration of the grounded and political processes underpinning the formation and implementation of the city-regional integration policies proliferating in China recently. The paper's second point of significance lies in its contribution to broader literature on city-regionalism and state rescaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "City-region", "Inter-city co-operation", "Inter-city competition", "Regional integration", "State rescaling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921056451", "SubjectAreas": [["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"56522945700": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "56522945700", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and Oceanographic Science, Research Centre of Human Geography, Nanjing University"}, "7403463877": {"Name": "Wu F.", "AuthorID": "7403463877", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "57084617500": {"Name": "Hay I.", "AuthorID": "57084617500", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "School of the Environment, Flinders University"}}}
