Encapsulation of anticancer agents inside CNTs provides protection from external deactivating agents. However, the open ends of the CNTs leave the encapsulated drugs exposed to the environment and eventually their uncontrolled release before reaching the desired target. In this study, we report the successful encapsulation of cisplatin, a FDA-approved chemotherapeutic drug, into multi-walled carbon nanotubes and the capping at the ends with functionalised gold nanoparticles to achieve a \"carbon nanotube bottle\" structure. In this proof-of-concept study, these caps did not prevent the encapsulation of drug in the inner space of CNTs; on the contrary, we achieved higher drug loading inside the nanotubes in comparison with data reported in literature. In addition, we demonstrated that encapsulated cisplatin could be delivered in living cells under physiological conditions to exert its pharmacological action. \u00a9 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
