Strategies for reconciling them are intensely debated. We argue that harmonization between biodiversity conservation and crop production can be improved by increasing our understanding of the underlying relationships between them. We provide a general conceptual framework that links biodiversity and agricultural production through the separate relationships between land use and biodiversity and between land use and production. Hypothesized relationships are derived by synthesizing existing empirical and theoretical ecological knowledge. The framework suggests nonlinear relationships caused by the multifaceted impacts of land use (composition, configuration, and intensity). We propose solutions for overcoming the apparently dichotomous aims of maximizing either biodiversity conservation or agricultural production and suggest new hypotheses that emerge from our proposed framework.", "AuthorKeywords": ["agricultural production", "biodiversity conservation", "land-use intensity", "landscape composition", "landscape configuration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994344889", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"7003453478": {"Name": "Seppelt R.", "AuthorID": "7003453478", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geoscience and Geography, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg"}, "55320219000": {"Name": "Beckmann M.", "AuthorID": "55320219000", "AffiliationID": "60018229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Landscape Ecology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research"}, "34881399900": {"Name": "Cord A.F.", "AuthorID": "34881399900", "AffiliationID": "60018229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Landscape Ecology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research"}, "55878201500": {"Name": "Gerstner K.", "AuthorID": "55878201500", "AffiliationID": "60018229", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computational Landscape Ecology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research"}, "56580362900": {"Name": "Ceau\u015fu S.", "AuthorID": "56580362900", "AffiliationID": "60014059", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biology, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg"}, "35242993500": {"Name": "Klotz S.", "AuthorID": "35242993500", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "IDiv, German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research"}, "35228202800": {"Name": "Winter M.", "AuthorID": "35228202800", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "IDiv, German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research"}, "55750990200": {"Name": "Kambach S.", "AuthorID": "55750990200", "AffiliationID": "60014059, 60018229", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biology at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Department of Community Ecology, UFZ-Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research"}, "7004260642": {"Name": "Gurevitch J.", "AuthorID": "7004260642", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology and Evolution, Stony Brook University"}, "35769360000": {"Name": "Mendenhall C.", "AuthorID": "35769360000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Center for Conservation Biology, Department of Biology, Stanford University"}, "56333199300": {"Name": "Phillips H.R.P.", "AuthorID": "56333199300", "AffiliationID": "60025352, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London and the Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "57191862076": {"Name": "Powell K.", "AuthorID": "57191862076", "AffiliationID": "60151531", "AffiliationName": "National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center"}, "7003460110": {"Name": "Verburg P.H.", "AuthorID": "7003460110", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, VU University Amsterdam"}, "22135322100": {"Name": "Newbold T.", "AuthorID": "22135322100", "AffiliationID": "60111356", "AffiliationName": "United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre"}, "55514058600": {"Name": "Verhagen W.", "AuthorID": "55514058600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
