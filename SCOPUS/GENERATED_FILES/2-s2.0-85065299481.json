VET research is concerned with exploring continuity as well as change. This chapter offers a reflection on how the interplay of change and continuity might require a more substantive and relational approach across the VET landscape. It questions whether VET researchers are sufficiently concerned with the life and practices of contemporary workplaces. The chapter tentatively suggests that it is time for some recalibration of the way VET research is conceived and organized in order to have a broader influence on policy and practice at both a national and international level. A focus on work might also offer a way to overcome some of the difficulties involved in comparative VET research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Luxury good", "Occupational field", "Skill formation", "Soft skill", "Workplace change"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065299481", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"6602780847": {"Name": "Unwin L.", "AuthorID": "6602780847", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education (IOE), University College London (UCL)"}}}
