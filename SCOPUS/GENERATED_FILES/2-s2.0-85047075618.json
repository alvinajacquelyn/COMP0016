Few studies have analyzed the life cycle of new routine creation and replication as an integrated process. In an in-depth case study of England's Highways Agency, this paper shows that the creation and replication of a new routine across multiple sites involves four sequential steps: envisioning, experimenting, entrenching and enacting. We contribute to the capabilities research in two ways: first, by showing how different organizational levels, capabilities and logics (cognitive and behavioural) shape the development of new routines; and second, by identifying how distinct evolutionary cycles of variation and selective retention occur during each step in the process. In contrast with prior research on replication as an exact copy of a template or existing routine, our study focuses on the replication of an entirely new routine (based on novel principles) that is adapted to fit local operational conditions during its large-scale replication across multiple sites. We draw upon insights from adjacent \u2018practice research\u2019 and suggest how capabilities and practice studies may complement each other in future research on the evolution of routines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capabilities", "Creation", "Organizational hierarchy", "Replication", "Routines"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capabilities", "Creation", "Organizational hierarchies", "Replication", "Routines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047075618", "SubjectAreas": [["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57210968448": {"Name": "Davies A.", "AuthorID": "57210968448", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London"}, "12760182600": {"Name": "Frederiksen L.", "AuthorID": "12760182600", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Management, Aarhus University, BSS"}, "10043789100": {"Name": "Cacciatori E.", "AuthorID": "10043789100", "AffiliationID": "60020134, 60025704", "AffiliationName": "Cass Business School, City, University of London"}, "35753126400": {"Name": "Hartmann A.", "AuthorID": "35753126400", "AffiliationID": "60020599", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering Technology, Department of Construction Management & Engineering, University of Twente"}}}
