All rights reserved.The case of a patient who presented with neonatal seizures unresponsive to conventional antiepileptic drugs and pyridoxine is reported. The baby girl was subsequently treated with pyridoxal 50 -phosphate (PLP) on day 20 of life, and showed rapid seizure control and normal development, with only mildly abnormal liver function tests at the current age of 6 years. Sequencing of the pyridox(am)ine 5\u2032 -phosphate oxidase (PNPO) gene revealed a heterozygous insertion of a single base in exon 7. The second allele was found to be normal although the patient may carry a mutation in another gene of the vitamin B6 pathway. Follow-up at 6 years of age showed a seizure-free young girl (on 42 mg/kg/day PLP) with normal development but mild elevation of liver function tests. A high index of suspicion for metabolic disease must be kept in mind with neonatal seizures unresponsive to conventional treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anticonvulsants", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Liver", "Liver Function Tests", "Mutagenesis, Insertional", "Pyridoxal Phosphate", "Pyridoxaminephosphate Oxidase", "Seizures", "Vitamin B Complex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929591402", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56483379900": {"Name": "Raimondi F.", "AuthorID": "56483379900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Section of Pediatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Universit\u00e0 Federico II"}, "57194103225": {"Name": "Del Giudice E.", "AuthorID": "57194103225", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Section of Pediatrics, Department of Translational Medical Sciences, Universit\u00e0 Federico II"}, "57202556029": {"Name": "Mills P.", "AuthorID": "57202556029", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
