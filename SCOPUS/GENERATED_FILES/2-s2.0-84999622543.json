All rights reserved.Using a semi-classical model, we study the formation of highly excited neutral fragments during the fragmentation of H3 + , a two-electron triatomic molecule, driven by an intense near-IR laser field. To do so, we first formulate a microcanonical distribution for arbitrary one-electron triatomic molecules. We then study frustrated double and single ionization in strongly driven H3 +and compute the kinetic energy release of the nuclei for these two processes. Moreover, we investigate the dependence of frustrated ionization on the strength of the laser field as well as on the geometry of the initial molecular state.", "AuthorKeywords": ["frustrated ionization", "semi-classical", "strongly driven triatomic molecules"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classical model", "Kinetic energy release", "Molecular state", "Near-IR lasers", "Neutral fragments", "semi-classical", "Single ionization", "Triatomic molecules"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999622543", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56816105400": {"Name": "Chen A.", "AuthorID": "56816105400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "16643072400": {"Name": "Lazarou C.", "AuthorID": "16643072400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57194688243": {"Name": "Price H.", "AuthorID": "57194688243", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603477664": {"Name": "Emmanouilidou A.", "AuthorID": "6603477664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
