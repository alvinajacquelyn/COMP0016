What is the secret that the evolution of human intelligence has unlocked? Generalization is one answer, but there is more to it. The brain does not directly solve difficult problems, it is able to recast them into new and more tractable problems. Here, we propose a model whereby higher cognitive functions profoundly interact with reinforcement learning to drastically reduce the degrees of freedom of the search space, simplifying complex problems, and fostering more efficient learning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence", "Brain", "Cognition", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Reinforcement, Psychology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063739404", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57192415234": {"Name": "Cortese A.", "AuthorID": "57192415234", "AffiliationID": "60001271", "AffiliationName": "Computational Neuroscience Laboratories, ATR Institute International"}, "7004347773": {"Name": "Kawato M.", "AuthorID": "7004347773", "AffiliationID": "60001271, 60016648", "AffiliationName": "RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project, ATR Institute International"}, "23391752900": {"Name": "De Martino B.", "AuthorID": "23391752900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
