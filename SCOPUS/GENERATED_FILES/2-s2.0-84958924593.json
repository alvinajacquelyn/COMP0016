Listeners heard sequences of \"ABA-\" triplets, where \"A\" and \"B\" were tones of different frequencies and \"-\" was a silent gap. Segregation was more frequently reported, and rhythmically deviant triplets less well detected, for a greater between-tone frequency separation and later in the sequence. In Experiment 1, performing a competing auditory task for the first part of the sequence led to a reduction in subsequent streaming compared to when the tones were attended throughout. This is consistent with focused attention promoting streaming, and/or with attention switches resetting it. However, the proportion of segregated reports increased more rapidly following a switch than at the start of a sequence, indicating that some streaming occurred automatically. Modeling ruled out a simple \"covert attention\" account of this finding. Experiment 2 required listeners to perform subjective and objective tasks concurrently. It revealed superior performance during integrated compared to segregated reports, beyond that explained by the codependence of the two measures on stimulus parameters. We argue that listeners have limited access to low-level stimulus representations once perceptual organization has occurred, and that subjective and objective streaming measures partly index the same processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Auditory scene analysis", "Auditory streaming", "Objective measures", "Perceptual organization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958924593", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55830349800": {"Name": "Billig A.", "AuthorID": "55830349800", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}, "7006201100": {"Name": "Carlyon R.", "AuthorID": "7006201100", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}}}
