A number of mediating factors have been hypothesized to explain this association, including enhanced social support, less substance abuse, and lower rates of psychopathology. Method: We utilized data from a two-phase population-based, epidemiological study of mental disorders among young Jewish Israel born in a 10-year birth-cohort conducted in the 1980s. This study included data on religiosity and suicidal behaviour. Twenty-five years thereafter, mortality data were obtained from a national vital statistics registry. Results: Rates of suicidal ideation were similar among secular, partially observant, and religious subjects (9.4%, 6.7%, and 6.2%, respectively; adjusted OR for linear trend: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.58-1.09). Rates of suicide attempts were significantly lower among religious subjects (2.4%, 2.5%, and 0.4% for secular, partially observant, and religious, respectively; adjusted OR for linear trend: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.88). Of the 4914 subjects, eight died by suicide: Seven of them were secular and one was partially observant (\u03c72 = 2.52, P = 0.09). There were no differences in social functioning or rates of psychopathology among the study groups. Conclusion: Religiosity has a protective effect against suicide attempts, which is independent of social functioning, psychopathology, and substance use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidemiology", "Religion", "Suicide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Israel", "Male", "Protective Factors", "Religion", "Risk Factors", "Suicidal Ideation", "Suicide, Attempted", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963700065", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"37116517400": {"Name": "Burshtein S.", "AuthorID": "37116517400", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatry, Chaim Sheba Medical Center"}, "25522505100": {"Name": "Werbeloff N.", "AuthorID": "25522505100", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatry, Chaim Sheba Medical Center"}, "7401858081": {"Name": "Davidson M.", "AuthorID": "7401858081", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatry, Chaim Sheba Medical Center"}, "55035659900": {"Name": "Weiser M.", "AuthorID": "55035659900", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatry, Chaim Sheba Medical Center"}, "7006194637": {"Name": "Dohrenwend B.", "AuthorID": "7006194637", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"}, "35513389800": {"Name": "Levav I.", "AuthorID": "35513389800", "AffiliationID": "60002021", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health, Ministry of Health"}}}
