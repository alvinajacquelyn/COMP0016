This volume embarks on a history of that technological substrate as it pertains to the making and viewing of art in early modern Europe, c. 1420-1820. It examines artists instruments, tools, devices, machines, technologies, crafts, materials, skills, and techniques in their historic applications, to consider how they shaped the course of early modern art. Probing both the category of technology and the broader implications of technological shifts on the history of visual cultures, the volume maps the multiple histories of visual instrumentation devised for the making and viewing of art, to consider early modern technologys relationship with a theoretical conceptualization of art in the wider visual field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964575177", "SubjectAreas": [["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"53564115000": {"Name": "Warwick G.", "AuthorID": "53564115000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Art History"}, "26121370200": {"Name": "Taws R.", "AuthorID": "26121370200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
