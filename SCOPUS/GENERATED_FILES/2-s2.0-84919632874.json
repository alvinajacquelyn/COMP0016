Although coinhibitory checkpoint blockade with anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) Ab can restore functions to exhausted T cell populations, recovery is often incomplete and dependent upon the pool size of a quiescent T-bethigh subset that expresses lower levels of PD-1. In a model in which unhelped, HY-specific CD8+ T cells gradually lose function following transfer to male bone marrow transplantation recipients, we have explored the effect of shifting the balance away from coinhibition and toward costimulation by combining anti-PD-L1 with agonistic Abs to the TNFR superfamily members, OX40 and CD27. Several weeks following T cell transfer, both agonistic Abs, but especially anti-CD27, demonstrated synergy with anti-PD-L1 by enhancing CD8+ T cell proliferation and effector cytokine generation. Anti-CD27 and anti-PD-L1 synergized by downregulating the expression of multiple quiescence-related genes concomitant with a reduced frequency of T-bethigh cells within the exhausted population. However, in the presence of persistent Ag, the CD8+ T cell response was not sustained and the overall size of the effector cytokine-producing pool eventually contracted to levels below that of controls. Thus, CD27-mediated costimulation can synergize with coinhibitory checkpoint blockade to switch off molecular programs for quiescence in exhausted T cell populations, but at the expense of losing precursor cells required to maintain a response.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adoptive Transfer", "Animals", "Antibodies", "Antigens, CD27", "Antigens, CD274", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Female", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Receptors, OX40", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "Tumor Necrosis Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919632874", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"6701356992": {"Name": "Buchan S.L.", "AuthorID": "6701356992", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "37079444600": {"Name": "Rogel A.", "AuthorID": "37079444600", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "6603684074": {"Name": "Al-Shamkhani A.", "AuthorID": "6603684074", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Sciences Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "36889860300": {"Name": "Manzo T.", "AuthorID": "36889860300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "12770706300": {"Name": "Flutter B.", "AuthorID": "12770706300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "37021492600": {"Name": "Edwards N.", "AuthorID": "37021492600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "56457148100": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "56457148100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "37021763700": {"Name": "Sivakumaran S.", "AuthorID": "37021763700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "23987460500": {"Name": "Ghorashian S.", "AuthorID": "23987460500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "7102495795": {"Name": "Carpenter B.", "AuthorID": "7102495795", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "7401715179": {"Name": "Bennett C.L.", "AuthorID": "7401715179", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "6701831494": {"Name": "Chakraverty R.", "AuthorID": "6701831494", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}, "7202722149": {"Name": "Freeman G.J.", "AuthorID": "7202722149", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "7202153535": {"Name": "Sykes M.", "AuthorID": "7202153535", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Columbia Center for Translational Immunology, Columbia University Medical Center"}, "7005225169": {"Name": "Croft M.", "AuthorID": "7005225169", "AffiliationID": "114837964", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Allergy and Immunology"}}}
