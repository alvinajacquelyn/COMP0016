All rights reserved.Background Neuropsychiatric safety and relative efficacy of varenicline, bupropion, and transdermal nicotine patch (NRT) in those with psychiatric disorders are of interest. Methods We performed secondary analyses of safety and efficacy outcomes by psychiatric diagnosis in EAGLES (Evaluating Adverse Events in a Global Smoking Cessation Study), a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy, placebo- and active (NRT)-controlled trial of varenicline and bupropion with 12-week follow-up, in a subset population, n = 4092, with a primary psychotic (n = 390), anxiety (n = 792), or mood (n = 2910) disorder. Primary end-point parameters were incidence of prespecified moderate and severe neuropsychiatric adverse events (NPSAEs) and weeks 9 to 12 continuous abstinence rates (9-12CAR). Results The observed NPSAE incidence across treatments was 5.1% to 6.3% in those with a psychotic disorder, 4.6% to 8.0% in those with an anxiety disorder, and 4.6% to 6.8% in those with a mood disorder. Neither varenicline nor bupropion was associated with significantly increased NPSAEs relative to NRT or placebo in the psychiatric cohort or any psychiatric diagnostic subcohort. There was a significant effect of treatment on 9-12CAR (P < 0.0001) and no significant treatment-by-diagnostic subcohort interaction (P = 0.24). Abstinence rates with varenicline were superior to bupropion, NRT, and placebo, and abstinence with bupropion and NRT was superior to placebo. Within-diagnostic subcohort comparisons of treatment efficacy yielded estimated odds ratios for 9-12CAR versus placebo of greater than 3.00 for varenicline, greater than 1.90 for bupropion, and greater than 1.80 for NRT for all diagnostic groups. Conclusions Varenicline, bupropion, and nicotine patch are well tolerated and effective in adults with psychotic, anxiety, and mood disorders. The relative effectiveness of varenicline, bupropion, and NRT versus placebo did not vary across psychiatric diagnoses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "bupropion", "mood", "schizophrenia", "smoking cessation", "varenicline"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety Disorders", "Bupropion", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mood Disorders", "Psychotic Disorders", "Smoking Cessation", "Smoking Cessation Agents", "Tobacco Use Cessation Devices", "Treatment Outcome", "Varenicline"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062586932", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"6602164247": {"Name": "Evins A.E.", "AuthorID": "6602164247", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "16549198600": {"Name": "Benowitz N.L.", "AuthorID": "16549198600", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of California"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "35485400700": {"Name": "Russ C.", "AuthorID": "35485400700", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "7003891641": {"Name": "McRae T.", "AuthorID": "7003891641", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "16157175300": {"Name": "Lawrence D.", "AuthorID": "16157175300", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "22956290900": {"Name": "St Aubin L.", "AuthorID": "22956290900", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}, "9037993900": {"Name": "Krishen A.", "AuthorID": "9037993900", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "57192805636": {"Name": "Maravic M.C.", "AuthorID": "57192805636", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "6603919154": {"Name": "Anthenelli R.M.", "AuthorID": "6603919154", "AffiliationID": "60121686, 60030612", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of California"}}}
