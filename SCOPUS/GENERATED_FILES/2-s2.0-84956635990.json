It determines the singlet exciton diffusion lengths in polymer films and has a direct impact on the photocurrent generation by organic solar cell devices. However, very little is known about the material properties controlling the lifetimes of singlet excitons, with most of our knowledge originating from studies of small organic molecules. Herein, we provide a brief summary of the nature of the excited states in conjugated polymer films and then present an analysis of the singlet exciton lifetimes of 16 semiconducting polymers. The exciton lifetimes of seven of the studied polymers were measured using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and compared to the lifetimes of seven of the most common photoactive polymers found in the literature. A plot of the logarithm of the rate of exciton decay vs. the polymer optical bandgap reveals a medium correlation between lifetime and bandgap, thus suggesting that the Energy Gap Law may be valid for these systems. This therefore suggests that small bandgap polymers can suffer from short exciton lifetimes, which may limit their performance in organic solar cell devices. In addition, the impact of film crystallinity on the exciton lifetime was assessed for a small bandgap diketopyrrolopyrrole co-polymer. It is observed that the increase of polymer film crystallinity leads to reduction in exciton lifetime and optical bandgap again in agreement with the Energy Gap Law.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion", "Energy gap law", "Excited states", "Non-radiative", "Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diketopyrrolopyrroles", "Energy gap law", "Non-radiative", "Photoactive polymers", "Photocurrent generations", "Small organic molecules", "Solar cell devices", "Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956635990", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"]], "AuthorData": {"24821388000": {"Name": "Dimitrov S.D.", "AuthorID": "24821388000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Plastic Electronics, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7201429440": {"Name": "Nielsen C.B.", "AuthorID": "7201429440", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Plastic Electronics, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "53866415700": {"Name": "Fei Z.", "AuthorID": "53866415700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Plastic Electronics, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "57216793729": {"Name": "McCulloch I.", "AuthorID": "57216793729", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SPERC, Physical Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "6701353187": {"Name": "Heeney M.", "AuthorID": "6701353187", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Plastic Electronics, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56401622800": {"Name": "Durrant J.R.", "AuthorID": "56401622800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Plastic Electronics, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "37116115600": {"Name": "Schroeder B.C.", "AuthorID": "37116115600", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
