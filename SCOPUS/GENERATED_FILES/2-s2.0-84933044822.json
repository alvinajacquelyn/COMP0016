Recent studies of sound localization have shown that adaptation and learning involve multiple mechanisms that operate at different timescales and stages of processing, with other sensory and motor-related inputs playing a key role. We are only just beginning to understand, however, how these processes interact with one another to produce adaptive changes at the level of neuronal populations and behavior. Because there is no explicit map of auditory space in the cortex, studies of sound localization may also provide much broader insight into the plasticity of complex neural representations that are not topographically organized.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Animals", "Brain", "Humans", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Sound Localization", "Space Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933044822", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36437241400": {"Name": "Keating P.", "AuthorID": "36437241400", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}, "26642878800": {"Name": "King A.J.", "AuthorID": "26642878800", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford"}}}
