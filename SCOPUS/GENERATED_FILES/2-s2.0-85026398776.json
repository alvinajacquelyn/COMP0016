We sought to evaluate the respective effects of prior microvascular and macrovascular disease on the risk of major outcomes, including microvascular events, in these patients. Methods: Participants in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: PreterAx and DiamicroN Modified-Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial (n = 11,140) and the ADVANCE-ON post-trial study (n = 8494) were categorized into 4 groups at baseline: dual absence of microvascular or macrovascular disease (n = 6789), presence of microvascular disease alone (n = 761), macrovascular disease alone (n = 3196), and both (n = 394). Outcomes were all-cause mortality, major macrovascular events (MACE), and major clinical microvascular events. Results: All-cause mortality, MACE, and major clinical microvascular events occurred in 2265 (20%), 2166 (19%), and 807 (7%) participants respectively, during a median follow-up of 9.9 (inter-quartile interval 5.6-10.9) years. The adjusted hazard ratios [95% CI] of death, MACE, and major clinical microvascular events were each greater in patients with baseline microvascular disease (1.43 [1.20-1.71], 1.64 [1.37-1.97], and 4.74 [3.86-5.82], respectively), macrovascular disease (1.43 [1.30-1.57], 2.04 [1.86-2.25], and 1.26 [1.06-1.51]) or both (2.01 [1.65-2.45], 2.92 [2.40-3.55], and 6.30 [4.93-8.06]) compared with those without these conditions. No interaction was observed between baseline microvascular and macrovascular disease for these events. The addition of microvascular disease (change in c-statistic [95% CI] 0.005 [0.002-0.008], p = 0.02) or macrovascular disease (0.005 [0.002-0.007], p < 0.0001) considered separately or together (0.011 [0.007-0.014], p < 0.0001) improved the discrimination and the classification (integrated discrimination improvement (IDI): 0.013 [0.010-0.016], p < 0.001; net reclassification improvement (NRI): 0.021 [0.011-0.032], p < 0.001) of the risk of all-cause mortality. Microvascular disease improved discrimination (0.009 [0.003-0.014]) and classification (IDI: 0.008 [0.006-0.010]; NRI: 0.011 [0.001-0.020]) of MACE. Baseline macrovascular disease modestly enhanced IDI (0.002 [0.001-0.002]) and NRI (0.041 [0.002-0.087]), but not discrimination, of major clinical microvascular events. Conclusions: Microvascular and macrovascular disease are independently associated with the 10-year risk of death, MACE, and major clinical microvascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. The coexistence of these conditions was associated with the highest risks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Macrovascular disease", "Microvascular disease", "Mortality", "Type 2 diabetes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Diabetic Angiopathies", "Drug Combinations", "Female", "Gliclazide", "Humans", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Indapamide", "Male", "Microvessels", "Middle Aged", "Perindopril", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026398776", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"24173541600": {"Name": "Mohammedi K.", "AuthorID": "24173541600", "AffiliationID": "60022785, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diabetology, Endocrinology and Nutrition, Assistance Publique H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Bichat Hospital, DHU FIRE"}, "7102510958": {"Name": "Woodward M.", "AuthorID": "7102510958", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"}, "6603071699": {"Name": "Zoungas S.", "AuthorID": "6603071699", "AffiliationID": "60012932, 60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash University, Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine"}, "54912078200": {"Name": "Chalmers J.", "AuthorID": "54912078200", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60104730", "AffiliationName": "The George Institute for Global Health, University of Sydney"}, "57190092171": {"Name": "Marre M.", "AuthorID": "57190092171", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "University Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, UFR de M\u00e9decine"}, "7006293267": {"Name": "Colagiuri S.", "AuthorID": "7006293267", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Boden Institute of Obesity, Nutrition, Exercise and Eating Disorders, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "7404410528": {"Name": "Cooper M.", "AuthorID": "7404410528", "AffiliationID": "60033409", "AffiliationName": "Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute"}, "7005401249": {"Name": "Harrap S.", "AuthorID": "7005401249", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "The University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "36039693200": {"Name": "Mancia G.", "AuthorID": "36039693200", "AffiliationID": "60012306, 60006646", "AffiliationName": "The University of Milan-Bicocca and Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}, "7006154423": {"Name": "Poulter N.", "AuthorID": "7006154423", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Imperial College, The International Centre for Circulatory Health"}, "7404503273": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "7404503273", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London (UCL) and NIHR UCL Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
