Currently, three main types of blast wall are used; flat, stiffened panel and corrugated. Given its particular geometric characteristics, corrugated blast walls are better energy-absorbing systems than other types of blast wall. Thus, corrugated blast walls are often installed in offshore installations to protect against hydrocarbon explosions. However, limited information is available on the influence of parameters of corrugated blast walls such as breadth, height, angle and thickness on lateral deflection, as well as cost. Hence, optimised parameters that consider the comparison between damage (deformation) and cost must be determined for corrugated blast walls. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of design parameters on the nonlinear structural characteristics and cost of corrugated blast walls in association with cost-benefit analysis. A dynamic finite element analysis was performed by analysis system/Livermore software-dynamics (ANSYS/LS-DYNA) by varying wall thickness, breadth, height and angle of corrugation. Design guidance is offered with an example of how to determine the parameters of a blast wall.", "AuthorKeywords": ["corrugated blast wall", "cost\u2013benefit analysis", "hydrocarbon explosion", "nonlinear structural response", "offshore installation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benefit analysis", "Blast walls", "Dynamic finite element analysis", "Energy absorbing systems", "Geometric characteristics", "Nonlinear structural response", "Offshore installations", "Structural characteristics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941169544", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56734059600": {"Name": "Lei H.", "AuthorID": "56734059600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "56089462600": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "56089462600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "56734015600": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "56734015600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "37097077300": {"Name": "Ha Y.", "AuthorID": "37097077300", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "36890591400": {"Name": "Seo J.", "AuthorID": "36890591400", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "23009087100": {"Name": "Kim B.", "AuthorID": "23009087100", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
