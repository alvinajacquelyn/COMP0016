We aimed to assess patients with reduced LVEF referred to catheter ablation of AF, and the efficacy and safety of this procedure compared with healthier patients. Methods: 2083 consecutive procedures of catheter ablation of AF in six centers were divided into two groups on the basis of LVEF (\u2264 vs >35%) and comparisons were performed regarding procedural safety and efficacy. Results: Only 51 (2.4%) of patients had low LVEF. Complication rate was comparable: 8.0% vs 6.9% (P =.760). Low LVEF patients are more frequently in persistent AF at the time of the procedure, have a higher degree of left atrial dilation, and higher CHA2DS2VASc score. The rate of atrial arrhythmia relapse post-blanking period in the first 12 months was higher in the low LVEF group: 58.0% vs 37.6% (P <.001). During a median follow-up of 14 months (IQR 5-24), after adjusting for all baseline differences, AF duration, paroxysmal AF, CHA2DS2VASc score, BMI, and indexed LA volume were independent predictors of relapse. LVEF and LVEF \u2264 35% were not identified as predictors of relapse. Conclusions: Patients with reduced LVEF account for only a minority of patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF. However, ablation appears to be as safe as for the general population, and albeit the efficacy seems lower, this appears to be driven by other comorbidities or features, which are more frequent in this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["heart failure", "LV ejection fraction", "mortality", "sinus rhythm", "vascular complications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Aged", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Catheter Ablation", "Europe", "Female", "Health Status", "Heart Failure", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Veins", "Recurrence", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Stroke Volume", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070459232", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"15769947600": {"Name": "Provid\u00eancia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College of London"}, "8430919500": {"Name": "Combes S.", "AuthorID": "8430919500", "AffiliationID": "119005633", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, Clinic Pasteur of Toulouse"}, "22984769000": {"Name": "Combes N.", "AuthorID": "22984769000", "AffiliationID": "119005633", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, Clinic Pasteur of Toulouse"}, "57202674944": {"Name": "Sousa M.J.", "AuthorID": "57202674944", "AffiliationID": "119005633", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, Clinic Pasteur of Toulouse"}, "57201117523": {"Name": "Jebberi Z.", "AuthorID": "57201117523", "AffiliationID": "119005633", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, Clinic Pasteur of Toulouse"}, "6602624083": {"Name": "Albenque J.P.", "AuthorID": "6602624083", "AffiliationID": "119005633", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, Clinic Pasteur of Toulouse"}, "6701478201": {"Name": "Boveda S.", "AuthorID": "6701478201", "AffiliationID": "119005633", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, Clinic Pasteur of Toulouse"}, "35338903200": {"Name": "Creta A.", "AuthorID": "35338903200", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "35078522400": {"Name": "Hunter R.J.", "AuthorID": "35078522400", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "26659044200": {"Name": "Honarbakhsh S.", "AuthorID": "26659044200", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Department, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "24334785700": {"Name": "de Asmundis C.", "AuthorID": "24334785700", "AffiliationID": "60069985, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Heart Rhythm Management Centre, Universiteit Ziekenhuis Brussel, Postgraduate Program in Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "8267161900": {"Name": "Chierchia G.", "AuthorID": "8267161900", "AffiliationID": "60069985, 60026810", "AffiliationName": "Heart Rhythm Management Centre, Universiteit Ziekenhuis Brussel, Postgraduate Program in Cardiac Electrophysiology and Pacing, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "57208682149": {"Name": "Chun J.", "AuthorID": "57208682149", "AffiliationID": "60084797, 60083998", "AffiliationName": "Cardioangiologisches Centrum Bethanien, Medizinische Klinik III, Markus Krankenhaus"}, "35286281300": {"Name": "Schmidt B.", "AuthorID": "35286281300", "AffiliationID": "60084797, 60083998", "AffiliationName": "Cardioangiologisches Centrum Bethanien, Medizinische Klinik III, Markus Krankenhaus"}, "55008156900": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "55008156900", "AffiliationID": "60084797, 60083998", "AffiliationName": "Cardioangiologisches Centrum Bethanien, Medizinische Klinik III, Markus Krankenhaus"}, "7003896138": {"Name": "Defaye P.", "AuthorID": "7003896138", "AffiliationID": "60002060", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de rythmologie et stimulation cardiaque, CHU Michallon"}, "7004266445": {"Name": "Anselme F.", "AuthorID": "7004266445", "AffiliationID": "60004603", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospital"}}}
