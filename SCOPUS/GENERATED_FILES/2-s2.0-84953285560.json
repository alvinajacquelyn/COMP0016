They have been the target of various recent experiments, with healthy participants and psychiatric populations engaging as dyads in multi-round exchanges such as a repeated trust task. Behaviour in such exchanges involves complexities related to each agent\u2019s preference for equity with their partner, beliefs about the partner\u2019s appetite for equity, beliefs about the partner\u2019s model of their partner, and so on. Agents may also plan different numbers of steps into the future. Providing a computationally precise account of the behaviour is an essential step towards understanding what underlies choices. A natural framework for this is that of an interactive partially observable Markov decision process (IPOMDP). However, the various complexities make IPOMDPs inordinately computationally challenging. Here, we show how to approximate the solution for the multi-round trust task using a variant of the Monte-Carlo tree search algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm is efficient and effective, and therefore can be used to invert observations of behavioural choices. We use generated behaviour to elucidate the richness and sophistication of interactive inference.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Computational Biology", "Decision Making", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Markov Chains", "Models, Biological", "Monte Carlo Method", "Psychological Theory", "Reward", "Trust"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953285560", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"55488751900": {"Name": "Hula A.", "AuthorID": "55488751900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7004572764": {"Name": "Montague P.R.", "AuthorID": "7004572764", "AffiliationID": "60027090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
