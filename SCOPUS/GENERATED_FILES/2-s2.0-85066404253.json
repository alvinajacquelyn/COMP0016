However, variability in results among studies using these mouse strains has led to questions about the value of these models. Here, we appraise various mouse models for dissecting neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and emphasize the importance of asking appropriate research questions. In therapeutic studies, we suggest that understanding variability among and within mouse models is crucial for preventing translational failures in human patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Circadian Rhythm", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Mice", "Microbiota", "Mutation", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066404253", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57203069236": {"Name": "Fisher E.M.C.", "AuthorID": "57203069236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, University College London"}, "26642885900": {"Name": "Bannerman D.M.", "AuthorID": "26642885900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}}}
