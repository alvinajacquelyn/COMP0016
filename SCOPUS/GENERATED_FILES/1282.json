All rights reserved.Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is an aggressive malignancy of T or B lymphocytes. Sometimes considered more a disease of childhood, it nonetheless affects adults, with an increasing incidence in older age. The treatment of adults is based on that of children. However, there are differences between them - both in genetics and in tolerance of treatment - leading to a much less good eventual outcome to treatment in adults. This chapter examines the clinical presentation, diagnosis, prognostic factors and therapy of ALL in adults, based on current literature. There is an emphasis on the practical aspects of diagnosis and supportive care whilst the background delineates particular aspects of the treatment of adults to which attention is needed such as treatment toxicities and stem cell transplant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia", "Adult", "Bone marrow transplant", "Chemotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976447900", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6603117301": {"Name": "Rowntree C.J.", "AuthorID": "6603117301", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University Hospital of Wales"}, "7102396522": {"Name": "Fielding A.K.", "AuthorID": "7102396522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
