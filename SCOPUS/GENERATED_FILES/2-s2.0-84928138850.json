As the dominant axis of tooth growth is orientated from the occlusal surface to the enamel-root junction, the isotopic composition of an enamel sample that spans the full length of this axis is often taken to represent a whole-tooth or 'bulk' average, while serial (or 'intra-tooth') samples taken along the same axis are considered to track isotopic variation across the period of tooth formation. A 'bulk' sample of enamel should therefore approximate the mean of the 'serial' samples, and in teeth that form over a complete annual cycle 'bulk' and 'serial' sampling methods are often assumed to possess an annual-seasonal relationship. However, this does not take into account the effect of the mineralisation process and sampling geometry on the derived isotope signals. Here we investigate the reproducibility of both the 'bulk' and 'serial' sampling methods as independent, stand-alone techniques and then explore the assumed relationship between the two. Each method shows good reproducibility in the oxygen (\u03b4<sup>18</sup>O) and carbon (\u03b4<sup>13</sup>C) isotope results across paired left and right molars. However, cross method comparisons reveal a systematic offset between bulk and serial results within a single population, with 19 out of 23 \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O bulk-tooth values being lower, and 22 out of 23 \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C bulk-tooth values being higher, than the means of their respective intra-tooth sequences. In 4 out of 19 cases for \u03b4<sup>18</sup>O and 6 out of 22 cases for \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C the bulk-tooth results fall completely out of the range observed in the corresponding intra-tooth sequence. This finding has implications for cross-method data comparisons and questions the assumed temporal relationship between 'serial' and 'bulk' isotope data.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bulk", "Enamel", "Isotope", "Seasonal", "Serial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bulk", "Complete annual cycles", "Isotopic composition", "Sampling strategies", "Seasonal", "Serial", "Stable-isotope analysis", "Temporal relationships"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928138850", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"36492162300": {"Name": "Reade H.", "AuthorID": "36492162300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "8747066900": {"Name": "Stevens R.", "AuthorID": "8747066900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "7202030377": {"Name": "Barker G.", "AuthorID": "7202030377", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge"}, "7102366592": {"Name": "O'Connell T.", "AuthorID": "7102366592", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge"}}}
