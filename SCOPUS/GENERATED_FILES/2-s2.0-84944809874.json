However, we know little about how trainee surgeons learn to make judgements in the visual domain. Objectives: We explored how trainees learn visual cue interpretation in the operating room. Methods: A multiple case study design was used. Participants were postgraduate surgical trainees and their trainers. Data included observer field notes, and integrated video- and audio-recordings from 12 cases representing more than 11 hours of observation. A constant comparative methodology was used to identify dominant themes. Results: Visual cue interpretation was a recurrent feature of trainer-trainee interactions and was achieved largely through the pedagogic mechanism of co-construction. Co-construction was a dialogic sequence between trainer and trainee in which they explored what they were looking at together to identify and name structures or pathology. Co-construction took two forms: 'guided co-construction', in which the trainer steered the trainee to see what the trainer was seeing, and 'authentic co-construction', in which neither trainer nor trainee appeared certain of what they were seeing and pieced together the information collaboratively. Whether the co-construction activity was guided or authentic appeared to be influenced by case difficulty and trainee seniority. Co-construction was shown to occur verbally, through discussion, and also through non-verbal exchanges in which gestures made with laparoscopic instruments contributed to the co-construction discourse. Conclusions: In the training setting, learning visual cue interpretation occurs in part through co-construction. Co-construction is a pedagogic phenomenon that is well recognised in the context of learning to interpret verbal information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Competence", "Cooperative Behavior", "Cues", "Education, Medical, Graduate", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Judgment", "Laparoscopy", "Learning", "Surgeons", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944809874", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"50261161400": {"Name": "Cope A.C.", "AuthorID": "50261161400", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds"}, "7004625073": {"Name": "Kneebone R.", "AuthorID": "7004625073", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "16506294300": {"Name": "Bezemer J.", "AuthorID": "16506294300", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Culture, Communication and Media, University College London Institute of Education"}, "6701422021": {"Name": "Lingard L.", "AuthorID": "6701422021", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Education Research and Innovation, Schulich School of medicine and Dentistry, Western University"}}}
