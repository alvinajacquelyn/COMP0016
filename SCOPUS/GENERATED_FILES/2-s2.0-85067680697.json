This study compared the following properties of SR assessments with established PTS assessments: interrater reliability, responsiveness to training, convergent validity of competence ratings, and predictive validity for academic outcomes. SR and PTS were both rated using the Cognitive Therapy Scale Revised (CTS-R) to assess CBT trainees\u2019 (n = 88) level of competence at the beginning and end of training, and at one-year follow-up. Both methods demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability between pairs of course tutors (ICC range =.81\u2013.93) and good reliability between tutors and an external assessor (ICC range =.71\u2013.74). CTS-R scores for both SR and PTS increased across training to reach the competence threshold and remained stable at follow-up. However, there was only a weak relationship between the two assessment methods. Further refinement of SR as a CBT assessment method is indicated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)", "Competence", "IAPT", "Patient recordings", "Standardised role play"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067680697", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"6506865587": {"Name": "Liness S.", "AuthorID": "6506865587", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57201135435": {"Name": "Beale S.", "AuthorID": "57201135435", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57205063242": {"Name": "Byrne S.", "AuthorID": "57205063242", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "7101825299": {"Name": "Hirsch C.R.", "AuthorID": "7101825299", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57203070666": {"Name": "Lea S.", "AuthorID": "57203070666", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "University of Hull"}, "7404789162": {"Name": "Clark D.M.", "AuthorID": "7404789162", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}}}
