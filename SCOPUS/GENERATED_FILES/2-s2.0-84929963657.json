In this Review, we focus on recent advances regarding the immunobiology of lymph node-derived FRCs, presenting an updated view of crucial checkpoints during their development and their dynamic control of lymph node expansion and contraction during infection. We highlight the robust effects of FRCs on systemic B cell and T cell responses, and we present an emerging view of FRCs as drivers of pathology following acute and chronic viral infections. Lastly, we review emerging therapeutic advances that harness the immunoregulatory properties of FRCs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "B-Lymphocytes", "Cell Communication", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Dendritic Cells, Follicular", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Infection", "Lymph Nodes", "Lymphoid Tissue", "Models, Immunological", "Myofibroblasts", "T-Lymphocytes", "Virus Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929963657", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55765001045": {"Name": "Fletcher A.", "AuthorID": "55765001045", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Immunity and Infection, Institute of Biomedical Research, University of Birmingham"}, "35169832600": {"Name": "Knoblich K.", "AuthorID": "35169832600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Immunity and Infection, Institute of Biomedical Research, University of Birmingham"}, "54390698000": {"Name": "Acton S.", "AuthorID": "54390698000", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University London"}}}
