This translocation results in the fusion of the ETV6 and RUNX1 genes. Since its discovery in the 1990s, the function of the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene has attracted intense interest. In this chapter, we will summarize current knowledge on the clinical significance of ETV6-RUNX1, the experimental models used to unravel its function in leukemogenesis, the identification of co-operating mutations and the mechanisms responsible for their acquisition, the function of the encoded transcription factor and finally, the future therapeutic approaches available to mitigate the associated disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Leukemia", "Oncogene", "Signalling", "TEL-AML1", "Transcription factor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carcinogenesis", "Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit", "Humans", "Leukemia", "Oncogene Proteins, Fusion", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets", "Repressor Proteins", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015380886", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57193651902": {"Name": "Sundaresh A.", "AuthorID": "57193651902", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Cancer section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "8081160000": {"Name": "Williams O.", "AuthorID": "8081160000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Cancer section, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
