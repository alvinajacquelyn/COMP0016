Whilst a health and social care team approach to supporting these patients is advocated, there is limited evidence regarding how pharmacists can best contribute. Objective To describe a new specialist pharmacy service (called the integrated care clinical pharmacist) in terms of how it works, what it achieves and its policy implications. Setting Patients\u2019 own homes in Lambeth, London, UK. Method Community matrons identified patients who were experiencing medicines related problems. These were referred to the integrated care clinical pharmacist who undertook a full medication review and recorded activities, which were independently analysed anonymously. Main outcome measure Medicines-related problems and the associated interventions. Result 143 patients were referred to the service over a 15-month period. A total of 376 medicines-related problems were identified: 28 (7%) supply issues, 107 (29%) compliance issues, 241 (64%) clinical issues. A diverse range of interventions were instigated by the pharmacist, requiring the coordination of community pharmacists, primary and secondary health and social care professionals. Conclusion This project demonstrated that including an integrated care clinical pharmacy service as part of the health and social care team that visits frail, older people in their own homes has benefits. The service operated as part of a wider inter-professional community team. The service also supported current health policy priorities in medicines optimization by identifying and addressing a wide range of medicines related problems for this vulnerable patient group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Frailty", "Integrated care", "Medicines", "Multi-morbidities", "Older people", "Optimization", "Pharmacy", "United Kingdom"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Frail Elderly", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Care Team", "Pharmacists", "Pharmacy Service, Hospital", "Primary Health Care", "Professional Role", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037629695", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacy", "HEAL", "3611"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"12752319400": {"Name": "Oboh L.", "AuthorID": "12752319400", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Adult Local Community Health Services, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56589524900": {"Name": "Leon C.", "AuthorID": "56589524900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Adult Local Community Health Services, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57199177311": {"Name": "Qadir S.", "AuthorID": "57199177311", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Adult Local Community Health Services, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7402856186": {"Name": "Smith F.", "AuthorID": "7402856186", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7103159039": {"Name": "Francis S.A.", "AuthorID": "7103159039", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
