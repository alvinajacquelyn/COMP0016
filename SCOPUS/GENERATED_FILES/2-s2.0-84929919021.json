Design The National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood (NSHPC) undertakes comprehensive population-based surveillance of HIV in pregnant women and children. Setting UK and Ireland. Population A cohort of 2398 singleton pregnancies delivered vaginally, or by emergency caesarean section, in women on cART in pregnancy during the period 2007-2012 with information on duration of ROM; HIV infection status was available for 1898 infants. Methods Descriptive analysis of NSHPC data. Main outcome measures Rates of MTCT. Results In 2116 pregnancies delivered at term, the median duration of ROM was 3 hours 30 minutes (interquartile range, IQR 1-8 hours). The overall MTCT rate for women delivering at term with duration of ROM \u22654 hours was 0.64% compared with 0.34% for ROM <4 hours, with no significant difference between the groups (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.45-7.97). In women delivering at term with a viral load of <50 copies/ml, there was no evidence of a difference in MTCT rates with duration of ROM \u22654 hours, compared with <4 hours (0.14% for \u22654 hours versus 0.12% for <4 hour; OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.07-18.27). Among infants born preterm with infection status available, there were no transmissions in 163 deliveries where the maternal viral load was <50 copies/ml. Conclusions No association was found between duration of ROM and MTCT in women taking cART.
