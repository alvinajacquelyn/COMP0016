We sought to estimate the effects of economic factors on risk of child maltreatment after adjusting for other known influences using the Australian Temperament Project, a population-based birth cohort of 2443 individuals and their parents. We used logistic regression to estimate associations of childhood economic factors (parental education, occupation, and unemployment; type of housing; and retrospective perception of poverty) with retrospective reports of perceived child maltreatment (physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, neglect, and witnessing of domestic violence), controlling for demographic factors, parental mental health and substance use, and child health. We then used these estimates to approximate the proportions of child maltreatment\u2014population attributable fractions\u2014that are theoretically preventable by addressing childhood economic disadvantage. Economic factors were associated with all types of child maltreatment. For the most part, these associations diminished only partially when controlling for noneconomic confounders, supporting hypotheses of causal relationships. Jointly, economic factors were significant predictors of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and witnessing of domestic violence but not of emotional abuse or neglect. Retrospective perceptions of childhood poverty were, in particular, strongly associated with most forms of child maltreatment but not with sexual abuse after accounting for other economic factors. We estimated that 27% of all child maltreatment was jointly attributable to economic factors. These findings suggest that strategies that reduce economic disadvantage are likely to hold significant potential to reduce the prevalence of child maltreatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child abuse and neglect", "Child maltreatment", "Poverty", "Risk factors", "Social determinants", "Socioeconomic disadvantage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005939704", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"55257282300": {"Name": "Doidge J.C.", "AuthorID": "55257282300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Administrative Data Research Centre for England, University College London"}, "7103128516": {"Name": "Segal L.", "AuthorID": "7103128516", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Research, University of South Australia"}, "7202960352": {"Name": "Higgins D.J.", "AuthorID": "7202960352", "AffiliationID": "60024749, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences, University of Melbourne"}, "57211310208": {"Name": "Edwards B.", "AuthorID": "57211310208", "AffiliationID": "60172662", "AffiliationName": "Australian Institute of Family Studies"}, "55916226700": {"Name": "Vassallo S.", "AuthorID": "55916226700", "AffiliationID": "60172662", "AffiliationName": "Australian Institute of Family Studies"}, "6603950043": {"Name": "Delfabbro P.", "AuthorID": "6603950043", "AffiliationID": "60009512, 60082335", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Adelaide"}, "6603782669": {"Name": "Toumbourou J.W.", "AuthorID": "6603782669", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "Deakin University"}}}
