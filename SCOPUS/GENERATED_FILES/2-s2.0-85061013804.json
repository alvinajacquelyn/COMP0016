Early fusion of these sutures leads to a medical condition known as craniosynostosis. The mechanobiology of normal and craniosynostotic skull growth is not well understood. In a series of previous studies, we characterized and modeled radial expansion of normal and craniosynostotic (Crouzon) mice. Here, we describe a new modeling algorithm to simulate bone formation at the sutures in normal and craniosynostotic mice. Our results demonstrate that our modeling approach is capable of predicting the observed ex vivo pattern of bone formation at the sutures in the aforementioned mice. The same approach can be used to model different calvarial reconstruction in children with craniosynostosis to assist in the management of this complex condition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bone formation", "Calvarial reconstruction", "Complex condition", "Craniosynostosis", "Mechano-biology", "Medical conditions", "Model algorithms", "Radial expansions", "Animals", "Mice", "Models, Biological", "Osteogenesis", "Skull", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061013804", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36608660200": {"Name": "Marghoub A.", "AuthorID": "36608660200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "24173602100": {"Name": "Moazen M.", "AuthorID": "24173602100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194540307": {"Name": "Libby J.", "AuthorID": "57194540307", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Medical and Biological Engineering, School of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Hull"}, "34973989700": {"Name": "Fagan M.", "AuthorID": "34973989700", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Medical and Biological Engineering, School of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Hull"}, "35556668100": {"Name": "Babbs C.", "AuthorID": "35556668100", "AffiliationID": "60001633, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "MRC Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}}}
