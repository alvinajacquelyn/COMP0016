However, there are ethical and practical difficulties associated with sourcing these materials; variability between donors may also be problematic when interpreting experimental data. Hence, there has been much interest in identifying a robust and high throughput model to study skin permeation that would generate more reproducible results. Here we investigate the permeability of a model active, niacinamide (NIA), in (i) conventional vertical Franz diffusion cells with excised human skin or porcine skin and (ii) a recently developed Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeation Assay (PAMPA) model. Both finite and infinite dose conditions were evaluated in both models using a series of simple NIA solutions and one commercial preparation. The Franz diffusion cell studies were run over 24 h while PAMPA experiments were conducted for 2.5 h. A linear correlation between both models was observed for the cumulative amount of NIA permeated in tested models under finite dose conditions. The corresponding correlation coefficients (r 2 ) were 0.88 for porcine skin and 0.71 for human skin. These results confirm the potential of the PAMPA model as a useful screening tool for topical formulations. Future studies will build on these findings and expand further the range of actives investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human", "Niacinamide", "PAMPA", "Permeation", "Porcine", "Skin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Cutaneous", "Animals", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Humans", "Membranes, Artificial", "Models, Biological", "Niacinamide", "Permeability", "Reproducibility of Results", "Skin Absorption", "Species Specificity", "Swine", "Vitamin B Complex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058463039", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57207475976": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57207475976", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56393831400": {"Name": "Lane M.E.", "AuthorID": "56393831400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57213994372": {"Name": "Hadgraft J.", "AuthorID": "57213994372", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "16156235300": {"Name": "Heinrich M.", "AuthorID": "16156235300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56643392600": {"Name": "Chen T.", "AuthorID": "56643392600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey"}, "7005705027": {"Name": "Lian G.", "AuthorID": "7005705027", "AffiliationID": "60029850", "AffiliationName": "Unilever Research Colworth"}, "14038010000": {"Name": "Sinko B.", "AuthorID": "14038010000", "AffiliationID": "60122322", "AffiliationName": "Pion Inc."}}}
