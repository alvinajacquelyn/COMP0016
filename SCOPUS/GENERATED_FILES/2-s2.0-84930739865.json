This paper describes an experiment which collected forced-choice judgements of emotion and gaze direction after 1000 ms exposure under 18 combinations of lamp type, luminance and interpersonal distances. Better performance was found with higher luminance and larger task size, but with diminishing returns according to a plateau-escarpment relationship. The results were used to estimate appropriate light levels for outdoor lighting. Results for judgements of emotion from facial expression suggest a minimum luminance of the face of 0.1-1.0 cd/m<sup>2</sup> if facial expressions are to be identified accurately at 4 m, but a luminance above 1.0 cd/m<sup>2</sup> for identification at 10 m.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Better performance", "Facial Expressions", "Gaze direction", "Light level", "Road lighting", "Visual components"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930739865", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6602873224": {"Name": "Fotios S.", "AuthorID": "6602873224", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}, "56571783400": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "56571783400", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}, "22233301000": {"Name": "Cheal C.", "AuthorID": "22233301000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}}}
