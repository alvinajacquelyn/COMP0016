The antimetabolites, mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil, are the current gold standards used primarily to prevent fibrosis after glaucoma surgery, but have potentially blinding complications like tissue damage, breakdown and infection. This review thus focuses on the development of new classes of small molecule therapeutics to prevent post-surgical fibrosis in the eye, especially in the context of glaucoma filtration surgery. We discuss recent advances and innovations in ophthalmic wound healing research, including antibodies, RNAi, gene therapy, nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, proteoglycans and small molecule inhibitors. We also review the challenges involved in terms of drug delivery, duration of action and potential toxicity of new anti-fibrotic agents in the eye.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibody", "gene therapy", "glaucoma filtration surgery", "inhibitor", "nanoparticle", "ocular fibrosis", "RNAi", "wound healing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921341644", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Optometry", "HEAL", "3610"]], "AuthorData": {"57142449100": {"Name": "Yu-Wai-Man C.", "AuthorID": "57142449100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, University College London (UCL)"}}}
