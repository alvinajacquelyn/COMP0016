This is an Open Access article under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 licenseBackground People with severe mental illnesses, including psychosis, have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. We aimed to evaluate the effects of a primary care intervention on decreasing total cholesterol concentrations and cardiovascular disease risk in people with severe mental illnesses. Methods We did this cluster randomised trial in general practices across England, with general practices as the cluster unit. We randomly assigned general practices (1:1) with 40 or more patients with severe mental illnesses using a computer-generated random sequence with a block size of four. Researchers were masked to allocation, but patients and general practice staff were not. We included participants aged 30\u201375 years with severe mental illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or psychosis), who had raised cholesterol concentrations (5\u00b70 mmol/L) or a total:HDL cholesterol ratio of 4\u00b70 mmol/L or more and one or more modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors. Eligible participants were recruited within each practice before randomisation. The Primrose intervention consisted of appointments (\u226412) with a trained primary care professional involving manualised interventions for cardiovascular disease prevention (ie, adhering to statins, improving diet or physical activity levels, reducing alcohol, or quitting smoking). Treatment as usual involved feedback of screening results only. The primary outcome was total cholesterol at 12 months and the primary economic analysis outcome was health-care costs. We used intention-to-treat analysis. The trial is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN13762819. Findings Between Dec 10, 2013, and Sept 30, 2015, we recruited general practices and between May 9, 2014, and Feb 10, 2016, we recruited participants and randomly assigned 76 general practices with 327 participants to the Primrose intervention (n=38 with 155 patients) or treatment as usual (n=38 with 172 patients). Total cholesterol concentration data were available at 12 months for 137 (88%) participants in the Primrose intervention group and 152 (88%) participants in the treatment-as-usual group. The mean total cholesterol concentration did not differ at 12 months between the two groups (5\u00b74 mmol/L [SD 1\u00b71] for Primrose vs 5\u00b75 mmol/L [1\u00b71] for treatment as usual; mean difference estimate 0\u00b703, 95% CI \u22120\u00b722 to 0\u00b729; p=0\u00b7788). This result was unchanged by pre-agreed supportive analyses. Mean cholesterol decreased over 12 months (\u22120\u00b722 mmol/L [1\u00b71] for Primrose vs \u22120\u00b736 mmol/L [1\u00b71] for treatment as usual). Total health-care costs (\u00a31286 [SE 178] in the Primrose intervention group vs \u00a32182 [328] in the treatment-as-usual group; mean difference \u2212\u00a3895, 95% CI \u22121631 to \u2212160; p=0\u00b7012) and psychiatric inpatient costs (\u00a3157 [135] vs \u00a3956 [313]; \u2212\u00a3799, \u22121480 to \u2212117; p=0\u00b7018) were lower in the Primrose intervention group than the treatment-as-usual group. Six serious adverse events of hospital admission and one death occurred in the Primrose group (n=7) and 23, including three deaths, occurred in the treatment-as-usual group (n=18). Interpretation Total cholesterol concentration at 12 months did not differ between the Primrose and treatment-as-usual groups, possibly because of the cluster design, good care in the treatment-as-usual group, short duration of the intervention, or suboptimal focus on statin prescribing. The association between the Primrose intervention and fewer psychiatric admissions, with potential cost-effectiveness, might be important.
