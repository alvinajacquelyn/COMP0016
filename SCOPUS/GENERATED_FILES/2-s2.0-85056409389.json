The main psychoactive drug in cannabis is \u0394 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a partial agonist at the endocannabinoid CB 1 receptor. Acutely, cannabis and THC produce a range of effects on several neurocognitive and pharmacological systems. These include effects on executive, emotional, reward and memory processing via direct interactions with the endocannabinoid system and indirect effects on the glutamatergic, GABAergic and dopaminergic systems. Cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating cannabinoid found in some forms of cannabis, may offset some of these acute effects. Heavy repeated cannabis use, particularly during adolescence, has been associated with adverse effects on these systems, which increase the risk of mental illnesses including addiction and psychosis. Here, we provide a comprehensive state of the art review on the acute and chronic neuropsychopharmacology of cannabis by synthesizing the available neuroimaging research in humans. We describe the effects of drug exposure during development, implications for understanding psychosis and cannabis use disorder, and methodological considerations. Greater understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of cannabis may also give rise to new treatment targets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Addiction", "Cannabis", "Cognition", "Development", "Neuroimaging", "Psychosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Cannabis", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Dronabinol", "Human Development", "Humans", "Marijuana Abuse", "Psychotropic Drugs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056409389", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55774659600": {"Name": "Bloomfield M.A.P.", "AuthorID": "55774659600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "56149013800": {"Name": "Hindocha C.", "AuthorID": "56149013800", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, University College Hospital"}, "57204615878": {"Name": "Green S.F.", "AuthorID": "57204615878", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Psychiatry Research Group, Research Department of Mental Health Neuroscience, Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57204627222": {"Name": "Lees R.", "AuthorID": "57204627222", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57204624019": {"Name": "Petrilli K.", "AuthorID": "57204624019", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "26535822300": {"Name": "Costello H.", "AuthorID": "26535822300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Psychiatry Research Group, Research Department of Mental Health Neuroscience, Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57204616215": {"Name": "Ogunbiyi M.O.", "AuthorID": "57204616215", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Psychiatry Research Group, Research Department of Mental Health Neuroscience, Division of Psychiatry, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "35077456700": {"Name": "Freeman T.P.", "AuthorID": "35077456700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "12781654600": {"Name": "Wall M.B.", "AuthorID": "12781654600", "AffiliationID": "60020416", "AffiliationName": "Invicro UK, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "24821034200": {"Name": "Bossong M.G.", "AuthorID": "24821034200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht"}}}
