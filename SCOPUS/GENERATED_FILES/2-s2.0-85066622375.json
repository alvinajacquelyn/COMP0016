Despite being defined as non-tumorigenic cells with high translational potential, human mid-trimester amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) are often described as sharing features with embryonic stem cells, including the expression of OCT4A, which could hinder their clinical potential. To clarify the OCT4A status of hAFSCs, we first undertook a systematic review of the literature. We then performed extensive gene and protein expression analyses to discover that neither frozen, nor fresh hAFSCs cultivated in multipotent stem cell culture conditions expressed OCT4A, and that the OCT4A positive results from the literature are likely to be attributed to the expression of pseudogenes or other OCT4 variants. To address this issue, we provide a robust protocol for the assessment of OCT4A in other stem cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amniotic Fluid", "Cell Lineage", "Exons", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Genetic Variation", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Hep G2 Cells", "Humans", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Multipotent Stem Cells", "Octamer Transcription Factor-3", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, Second", "Protein Isoforms", "Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066622375", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57195215813": {"Name": "Vlahova F.", "AuthorID": "57195215813", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57125654700": {"Name": "Hawkins K.E.", "AuthorID": "57125654700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57192643871": {"Name": "Ranzoni A.M.", "AuthorID": "57192643871", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57147342200": {"Name": "Hau K.L.", "AuthorID": "57147342200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "56800161100": {"Name": "Sagar R.", "AuthorID": "56800161100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, Maple House"}, "17034676900": {"Name": "Guillot P.V.", "AuthorID": "17034676900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, Maternal and Fetal Medicine Department"}, "57193662193": {"Name": "Coppi P.D.", "AuthorID": "57193662193", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Neonatal and Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7003709815": {"Name": "Adjaye J.", "AuthorID": "7003709815", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Stem Cell Research and Regenerative Medicine, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University, D\u00fcsseldorf, Moorenstr. 5"}}}
