The precise pathogenic mechanism of disease remains uncertain, but it is clearly complex and involves the activation and deregulation of many components of the immune system. Certain well-characterized patterns of immune pathology are shared by a significant subset of patients and selective targeting of one or more of the key immune system molecules offers the prospect of more effective treatment. This review addresses the current and future treatment for patients with lupus, going from the lessons learnt with pathophysiologic studies to recent clinical trials with biological agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biological drugs", "pathophysiology", "systemic lupus erythematosus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Autoimmunity", "Biological Therapy", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Humans", "Immune System", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Molecular Targeted Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942102388", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56721400300": {"Name": "Vilas-Boas A.", "AuthorID": "56721400300", "AffiliationID": "60014749", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine Department, Hospital Pedro Hispano"}, "26221569800": {"Name": "Bakshi J.", "AuthorID": "26221569800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College, London Hospitals"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.A.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010088", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, University College, London Hospitals"}}}
