Here, we demonstrate the potential of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal blood to transform prenatal diagnosis of monogenic disorders. Methods: Analysis of cell-free DNA using a PCR and restriction enzyme digest (PCR-RED) was compared with a novel NGS assay in pregnancies at risk of achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia. Results: PCR-RED was performed in 72 cases and was correct in 88.6%, inconclusive in 7% with one false negative. NGS was performed in 47 cases and was accurate in 96.2% with no inconclusives. Both approaches were used in 27 cases, with NGS giving the correct result in the two cases inconclusive with PCR-RED. Conclusion: NGS provides an accurate, flexible approach to non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of de novo and paternally inherited mutations. It is more sensitive than PCR-RED and is ideal when screening a gene with multiple potential pathogenic mutations. These findings highlight the value of NGS in the development of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis for other monogenic disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Achondroplasia", "Biomarkers", "DNA", "False Negative Reactions", "Female", "Genetic Markers", "Genetic Testing", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Maternal Serum Screening Tests", "Mutation", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Pregnancy", "Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 3", "Retrospective Studies", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Thanatophoric Dysplasia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933673322", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55914918300": {"Name": "Daley R.", "AuthorID": "55914918300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57208066633": {"Name": "Mason S.", "AuthorID": "57208066633", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "N-E Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35226237900": {"Name": "Barrett A.N.", "AuthorID": "35226237900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "N-E Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57204295860": {"Name": "Mckay F.", "AuthorID": "57204295860", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "N-E Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193306822": {"Name": "Lench N.", "AuthorID": "57193306822", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "N-E Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "9535391900": {"Name": "Jenkins L.A.", "AuthorID": "9535391900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "N-E Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
