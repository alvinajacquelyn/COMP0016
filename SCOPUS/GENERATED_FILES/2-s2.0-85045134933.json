Yet, besides maternal depression, limited knowledge exists about the effect of other emotions and the role of fathers. Using 290 triads (mother/father/child), we investigated how positive (SEEKING, CARING, PLAYFULNESS) and negative (FEAR, ANGER, SADNESS) dimensions of mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 affectivity relate to their offspring\u2019s externalizing and internalizing behaviours directly as well as indirectly via parenting practices. Parental variables were measured when children were 4 years old and children\u2019s behaviours were measured at 8 years of age. Latent Profile Analysis identified three parental affective profiles: low negative emotions, balanced, and high emotional. Structural equation models showed that, for boys, mothers\u2019 low negative emotions and high emotional profiles predicted later internalizing behaviours (direct effect; \u03b2 = \u22120.21 and \u03b2 = 0.23), while fathers\u2019 low negative emotions profile predicted externalizing behaviours indirectly (\u03b2 = \u22120.10). For girls, mothers\u2019 profiles (low negative emotions and high emotional) predicted both internalizing (\u03b2 = \u22120.04 and \u03b2 = 0.07) and externalizing (\u03b2 = \u22120.05 and \u03b2 = 0.09) behaviours indirectly, but no effects of fathers\u2019 profiles were found. Mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 affective profiles contributed to the behavioural development of their offspring in different ways, according to the type of behaviour (internalizing or externalizing) and the child\u2019s sex. These findings may help in tailoring existing parenting interventions on affective profiles, thus enhancing their efficacy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affective profiles", "externalizing behaviours", "internalizing behaviours", "Latent Profile Analysis", "parenting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045134933", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"55507171600": {"Name": "Orri M.", "AuthorID": "55507171600", "AffiliationID": "60031907, 60028492", "AffiliationName": "McGill Group for Suicide Studies, Douglas Mental Health University Centre, Department of Psychiatry"}, "7006183959": {"Name": "C\u00f4t\u00e9 S.M.", "AuthorID": "7006183959", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Montreal"}, "8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.B.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "24460456300": {"Name": "Rouquette A.", "AuthorID": "24460456300", "AffiliationID": "60106085, 60029937, 60106017, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "CESP, INSERM, University of Paris-Sud, UVSQ, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "7003400734": {"Name": "Falissard B.", "AuthorID": "7003400734", "AffiliationID": "60106085, 60029937, 60106017, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "CESP, INSERM, University of Paris-Sud, UVSQ, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay"}, "6602223822": {"Name": "Berthoz S.", "AuthorID": "6602223822", "AffiliationID": "60004158", "AffiliationName": "Institute Mutualiste Montsouris, Department of Adolescent and Young Adult Psychiatry"}, "15044351900": {"Name": "Herba C.", "AuthorID": "15044351900", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"}, "37072472300": {"Name": "Girard L.C.", "AuthorID": "37072472300", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "School of Health in Social Science, Department of Clinical Psychology, University of Edinburgh"}}}
