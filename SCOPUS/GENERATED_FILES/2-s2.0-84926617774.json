Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Institute of Biological Sciences.Despite intensive research during the past decade on the effects of alien species, invasion science still lacks the capacity to accurately predict the impacts of those species and, therefore, to provide timely advice to managers on where limited resources should be allocated. This capacity has been limited partly by the context-dependent nature of ecological impacts, research highly skewed toward certain taxa and habitat types, and the lack of standardized methods for detecting and quantifying impacts. We review different strategies, including specific experimental and observational approaches, for detecting and quantifying the ecological impacts of alien species. These include a four-way experimental plot design for comparing impact studies of different organisms. Furthermore, we identify hypothesis-driven parameters that should be measured at invaded sites to maximize insights into the nature of the impact. We also present strategies for recognizing high-impact species. Our recommendations provide a foundation for developing systematic quantitative measurements to allow comparisons of impacts across alien species, sites, and time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biological invasions", "Context dependence", "Ecosystem functioning", "Management", "Prediction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926617774", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"34971561300": {"Name": "Kumschick S.", "AuthorID": "34971561300", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Invasion Biology, Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University"}, "8945482200": {"Name": "Gaertner M.", "AuthorID": "8945482200", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Invasion Biology, Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University"}, "7403444596": {"Name": "Richardson D.M.", "AuthorID": "7403444596", "AffiliationID": "60001565", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Invasion Biology, Department of Botany and Zoology, Stellenbosch University"}, "7103149928": {"Name": "Vila M.", "AuthorID": "7103149928", "AffiliationID": "60006627", "AffiliationName": "Estaci\u00f3n Biol\u00f3gica de Do\u00f1ana"}, "23088206100": {"Name": "Essl F.", "AuthorID": "23088206100", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Conservation Biology, Vegetation and Landscape Ecology, University of Vienna"}, "8570480700": {"Name": "Jeschke J.M.", "AuthorID": "8570480700", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchens, Department of Ecology and Ecosystem Management, Restoration Ecology"}, "7004095579": {"Name": "Pysek P.", "AuthorID": "7004095579", "AffiliationID": "60045994, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Department of Invasion Ecology, Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "56118065900": {"Name": "Mrugala A.", "AuthorID": "56118065900", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ecology, Faculty of Science, Charles University"}, "8965078000": {"Name": "Pergl J.", "AuthorID": "8965078000", "AffiliationID": "60045994, 60031135", "AffiliationName": "Department of Invasion Ecology, Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic"}, "23486355900": {"Name": "Ricciardi A.", "AuthorID": "23486355900", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Redpath Museum, McGill University"}, "7004033052": {"Name": "Bacher S.", "AuthorID": "7004033052", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Unit Ecology and Evolution, University of Fribourg"}, "7102086774": {"Name": "Blackburn T.M.", "AuthorID": "7102086774", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "Environment Institute, School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "7201749438": {"Name": "Dick J.T.A.", "AuthorID": "7201749438", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Food Security, School of Biological Sciences, Queens University Belfast"}, "57191040828": {"Name": "Evans T.", "AuthorID": "57191040828", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Londons, Silwood Park Campus"}, "7006913433": {"Name": "Hulme P.E.", "AuthorID": "7006913433", "AffiliationID": "60006625", "AffiliationName": "Bio-Protection Research Centre, Lincoln University"}, "7005445011": {"Name": "K\u00fchn I.", "AuthorID": "7005445011", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research Halle-Jena-Leipzig"}, "56117097600": {"Name": "Sendek A.", "AuthorID": "56117097600", "AffiliationID": "60014059, 60018229", "AffiliationName": "Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, Department of Community Ecology, Martin-Luther-University Halle-Wittenbergs, Institute of Biology, Geobotany and Botanical Garden"}, "35228202800": {"Name": "Winter M.", "AuthorID": "35228202800", "AffiliationID": "60008042", "AffiliationName": "German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research Halle-Jena-Leipzig"}, "7003743449": {"Name": "Rabitsch W.", "AuthorID": "7003743449", "AffiliationID": "60028109", "AffiliationName": "Environment Agency Austria, Department of Biodiversity and Nature Conservation"}}}
