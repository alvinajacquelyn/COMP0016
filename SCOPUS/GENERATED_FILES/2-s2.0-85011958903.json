This study aimed to determine host factors that can predict severe sepsis in a bacteraemic cohort. Methods From December 2012 to November 2013, demographic, clinical and microbiological data were collected on consecutive patients with bacteraemia at a London teaching hospital. These data were used to categorize patients as having severe or non-severe sepsis. Multi-variate logistic regression was used to determine the association between host factors and severe sepsis. Findings Five hundred and ninety-four bacteraemic episodes occurred in 500 patients. The majority of cases were in patients aged >50 years (382/594, 64.3%) and in males (346/594, 58.2%). The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (207/594, 34.8%) and meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (57/594, 9.6%). In logistic regression multi-variable analysis, site of infection was significantly associated with severe sepsis. For catheter-associated urinary tract infections, the association was significant after adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index and where infection was acquired (odds ratio 3.94, 95% confidence interval 1.70\u20139.11). Conclusions Urinary catheters increase the risk of severe sepsis. They should only be used if clinically indicated. If inserted, a care bundle approach should be used and the anticipated removal date should be recorded unless a long-term catheter is required. In the context of sepsis, the presence of a urinary catheter should prompt immediate implementation of \u2018Sepsis Six\u2019 and consideration of transfer to a critical care unit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bacteraemia", "Outcomes", "Severe sepsis", "Urinary catheter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Catheter-Related Infections", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Hospitals, Teaching", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Sepsis", "Urinary Catheters", "Urinary Tract Infections", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011958903", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"12545919200": {"Name": "Melzer M.", "AuthorID": "12545919200", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56217321500": {"Name": "Welch C.", "AuthorID": "56217321500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
