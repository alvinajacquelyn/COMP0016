Extensive evidence indicates that, after sufficient learning, living organisms develop behavioural habits that permit them saving computational resources. Furthermore, humans and other animals are able to transfer control from deliberate to habitual modes (and vice versa), trading off efficiently flexibility and parsimony \u2013 an ability that is currently unparalleled by artificial control systems. Here, we discuss a computational implementation of habit formation, and the transfer of control from deliberate to habitual modes (and vice versa) within Active Inference: a computational framework that merges aspects of cybernetic theory and of Bayesian inference. To model habit formation, we endow an Active Inference agent with a mechanism to \u201ccache\u201d (or memorize) policy probabilities from previous trials, and reuse them to skip \u2013 in part or in full \u2013 the inferential steps of deliberative processing. We exploit the fact that the relative quality of policies, conditioned upon hidden states, is constant over trials; provided that contingencies and prior preferences do not change. This means the only quantity that can change policy selection is the prior distribution over the initial state \u2013 where this prior is based upon the posterior beliefs from previous trials. Thus, an agent that caches the quality (or the probability) of policies can safely reuse cached values to save on cognitive and computational resources \u2013 unless contingencies change. Our simulations illustrate the computational benefits, but also the limits, of three caching schemes under Active Inference. They suggest that key aspects of habitual behaviour \u2013 such as perseveration \u2013 can be explained in terms of caching policy probabilities. Furthermore, they suggest that there may be many kinds (or stages) of habitual behaviour, each associated with a different caching scheme; for example, caching associated or not associated with contextual estimation. These schemes are more or less impervious to contextual and contingency changes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active Inference", "Caching", "Deliberative control", "Habitisation", "Habitual control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active Inference", "Caching", "Computational framework", "Computational implementations", "Computational resources", "Deliberative control", "Habitisation", "Transfer of controls"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067188788", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"14033409700": {"Name": "Maisto D.", "AuthorID": "14033409700", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute for High Performance Computing and Networking, National Research Council"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6508225279": {"Name": "Pezzulo G.", "AuthorID": "6508225279", "AffiliationID": "60012572, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Sciences and Technologies, National Research Council"}}}
