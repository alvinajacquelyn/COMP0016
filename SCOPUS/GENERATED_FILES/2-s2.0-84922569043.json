We examined the longitudinal association between TV viewing, physical activity and inflammatory markers over a 4-year follow-up period. Methods: Participants were 3612 men and women (mean age 64.1\u00b18.2 years) from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Self-reported daily TV viewing was measured at baseline and 2 years follow up. Inflammatory markers (serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [CRP], white blood cell count [WBC], and fibrinogen) were measured at baseline (2008/09) and 4 years follow-up (2012/13). Results: On average, participants viewed TV for 5.1\u00b14.0h/d, and there was an increase of 1.9h/wk TV viewing over 2 years. In linear models adjusted for covariates including physical activity, TV viewing was not associated with logeCRP at follow-up (B=0.004, 95% CI, -0.001, 0.009, p=0.09) but was associated with WBC (B=0.018, 95% CI, 0.005, 0.031, p=0.006), and fibrinogen (B=0.004, 95% CI, 0.00, 0.008, p=0.035). In contrast, physical activity was inversely associated with CRP (p=0.047) and WBC (p=0.026), but not fibrinogen (p=0.22). An increase in TV viewing (of at least 1h/d) was associated with higher concentrations of CRP (p=0.015) and WBC (p=0.05) at follow up after adjustment for covariates and baseline TV viewing. Conclusions: Physical activity and sedentary behaviour have contrasting associations with markers of low grade inflammation over 4 years of follow-up. These behaviours may be important in influencing the pro-inflammatory state seen with ageing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adiposity", "Blood coagulation", "Exercise", "Inflammation", "Sedentary lifestyle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute-Phase Reaction", "Aged", "Aging", "Blood Coagulation", "C-Reactive Protein", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "England", "Exercise", "Female", "Fibrinogen", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Leukocytes", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Television"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922569043", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Exercise and Sports Science, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Sydney"}}}
