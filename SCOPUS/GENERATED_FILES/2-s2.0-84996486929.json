A natural ambiguity due to phase wrapping and local minima in the optimization problem cause a frequent artifact of fat-water inversion where fat-and water-only voxel values are swapped. This artifact affects up to 10% of routinely acquired Dixon images,and thus,has severe impact on subsequent analysis. We propose a simple yet very effective method,Dixon-Fix,for correcting fat-water swaps. Our method is based on regressing fat-and water-only images from in-and out-of-phase images by learning the conditional distribution of image appearance. The predicted images define the unary potentials in a globally optimal maximum-a-posteriori estimation of the swap labeling with spatial consistency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on whole-body MRI with various types of fat-water swaps.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conditional distribution", "Image appearance", "Maximum a posteriori estimation", "Optimization problems", "Scanner manufacturers", "Spatial consistency", "Water separation", "Whole body MRI"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996486929", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"23396784900": {"Name": "Glocker B.", "AuthorID": "23396784900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Image Analysis Group, Imperial College London"}, "7004895812": {"Name": "Rueckert D.", "AuthorID": "7004895812", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Image Analysis Group, Imperial College London"}, "23397396100": {"Name": "Konukoglu E.", "AuthorID": "23397396100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich"}, "44761184200": {"Name": "Lavdas I.", "AuthorID": "44761184200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Cancer Imaging Centre, Imperial College London"}, "7004143668": {"Name": "Aboagye E.", "AuthorID": "7004143668", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Cancer Imaging Centre, Imperial College London"}, "8749790100": {"Name": "Rockall A.", "AuthorID": "8749790100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Cancer Imaging Centre, Imperial College London"}, "35117674500": {"Name": "Iglesias J.", "AuthorID": "35117674500", "AffiliationID": "60111834", "AffiliationName": "BCBL"}}}
