We assessed the eff ectiveness of a nurse-led palliative care intervention on patient-reported outcomes. Methods We did this randomised controlled trial at a clinic in Kenya for adults with HIV, established on ART, and reporting moderate-to-severe pain or symptoms. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) either to a palliative care intervention (including assessments of physical, emotional, and spiritual wellbeing and quality of life) given six times over 4 months, or to usual care. Participants and investigators were not masked to allocation. The primary outcome was pain (scored on the African Palliative Care Association's African Palliative Outcome Scale). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01608802. Findings We screened 2070 patients, of whom we enrolled 120: 60 allocated to each group. In the control group, median pain score improved from 1.0 (IQR 0.0-2.0) at baseline to 5.0 (3.0-5.0) at 4 months; in the intervention group, it improved from 1.0 (0.0-2.0) at baseline to 4.5 (3.0-5.0) at 4 months. Compared with standard care, the intervention had no signifi cant eff ect on pain (coeffi cient -0.01, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.34, p=0.95). Interpretation A nurse-led palliative care intervention was not eff ective in reducing pain. However, person-centred assessment and care delivered by staff who have received additional training had positive eff ects on self-reported mental health related quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Ambulatory Care Facilities", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Kenya", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Pain Management", "Palliative Care", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947044646", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"55445023000": {"Name": "Lowther K.", "AuthorID": "55445023000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation, Cicely Saunders Institute, King's College London"}, "16246458800": {"Name": "Selman L.", "AuthorID": "16246458800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation, Cicely Saunders Institute, King's College London"}, "7006457362": {"Name": "Higginson I.", "AuthorID": "7006457362", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation, Cicely Saunders Institute, King's College London"}, "35490718500": {"Name": "Harding R.", "AuthorID": "35490718500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Palliative Care and Rehabilitation, Cicely Saunders Institute, King's College London"}, "24765744300": {"Name": "Simms V.", "AuthorID": "24765744300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55603944500": {"Name": "Gikaara N.", "AuthorID": "55603944500", "AffiliationID": "113190795", "AffiliationName": "Kenyan Hospice Palliative Care Association"}, "55445786300": {"Name": "Ali Z.", "AuthorID": "55445786300", "AffiliationID": "113190795", "AffiliationName": "Kenyan Hospice Palliative Care Association"}, "36501337800": {"Name": "Ahmed A.", "AuthorID": "36501337800", "AffiliationID": "114541916", "AffiliationName": "Bomu Hospital"}, "16947270400": {"Name": "Kariuki H.", "AuthorID": "16947270400", "AffiliationID": "60048717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physiology, University of Nairobi"}, "35847280700": {"Name": "Sherr L.", "AuthorID": "35847280700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}}}
