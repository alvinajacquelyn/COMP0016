Specifically, such problems are intended to show that use of probability theory results in legal paradoxes. As such, these problems have been a powerful detriment to the use of probability theory \u2013 and particularly Bayes theorem \u2013 in the law. However, the examples only lead to \u2018paradoxes\u2019 under an artificially constrained view of probability theory and the use of the so-called likelihood ratio, in which multiple related hypotheses and pieces of evidence are squeezed into a single hypothesis variable and a single evidence variable. When the distinct relevant hypotheses and evidence are described properly in a causal model (a Bayesian network), the paradoxes vanish. In addition to the twins problem and poison paradox, we demonstrate this for the food tray example, the abuse paradox and the small town murder problem. Moreover, the resulting Bayesian networks provide a powerful framework for legal reasoning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Humans", "Jurisprudence", "Likelihood Functions", "Models, Theoretical", "Problem Solving", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062683531", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"56037205000": {"Name": "de Zoete J.", "AuthorID": "56037205000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003719812": {"Name": "Fenton N.", "AuthorID": "7003719812", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57207695149": {"Name": "Noguchi T.", "AuthorID": "57207695149", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6507379819": {"Name": "Lagnado D.", "AuthorID": "6507379819", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
