At low concentrations, trans-presentation of IL-15 by dendritic cells can activate NK cells, whereas at higher concentrations it can act directly on NK cells, independently of accessory cells. In this study, we investigate the potential for IL-15 to boost responses to influenza virus by promoting accessory cell function. We find that coculture of human PBMCs with inactivated whole influenza virus (A/Victoria/361/2011) in the presence of very low concentrations of IL-15 results in increased production of myeloid cell\u2013derived cytokines, including IL-12, IFN-a2, GM-CSF, and IL-1b, and an increased frequency of polyfunctional NK cells (defined by the expression of two or more of CD107a, IFN-g, and CD25). Neutralization experiments demonstrate that IL-15\u2013mediated enhancement of NK cell responses is primarily dependent on IL-12 and partially dependent on IFN-abR1 signaling. Critically, IL-15 boosted the production of IL-12 in influenza-stimulated blood myeloid dendritic cells. IL-15 costimulation also restored the ability of less-differentiated NK cells from human CMV-seropositive individuals to respond to influenza virus. These data suggest that very low concentrations of IL-15 play an important role in boosting accessory cell function to support NK cell effector functions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Influenza A virus", "Influenza, Human", "Interleukin-12", "Interleukin-15", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Leukocytes, Mononuclear", "Lymphocyte Activation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046776743", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57201589713": {"Name": "Wagstaffe H.R.", "AuthorID": "57201589713", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Infection, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55998906300": {"Name": "Nielsen C.M.", "AuthorID": "55998906300", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60175818", "AffiliationName": "Jenner Institute, University of Oxford"}, "56224990000": {"Name": "Riley E.M.", "AuthorID": "56224990000", "AffiliationID": "60026158, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick), School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"}, "6701827231": {"Name": "Goodier M.R.", "AuthorID": "6701827231", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology and Infection, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
