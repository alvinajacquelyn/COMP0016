We identify two types of \u201cnovel\u201d words: words where the connection between their surface form and their meaning is broken (e.g., a misspelled word), and words where there is no meaning to connect to\u2014the meaning itself is also novel. We propose a method capable of wikifying both types of novel words while also dealing with the inherently large-scale disambiguation problem. We show that the method can disambiguate between up to 1,000 Wikipedia senses, and it can explain words with novel meaning as a mixture of other, possibly related senses. This mixture representation compares favorably to the widely used bag of words representation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interpreting novel words", "Link disambiguation", "Natural language processing", "Structured sparse coding", "Wikification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Interpreting novel words", "Link disambiguation", "NAtural language processing", "Sparse coding", "Wikification"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84914145564", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57205911261": {"Name": "Pint\u00e9r B.", "AuthorID": "57205911261", "AffiliationID": "60025187", "AffiliationName": "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University"}, "55735563900": {"Name": "V\u00f6r\u00f6s G.", "AuthorID": "55735563900", "AffiliationID": "60025187", "AffiliationName": "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University"}, "26643373200": {"Name": "L\u0151rincz A.", "AuthorID": "26643373200", "AffiliationID": "60025187", "AffiliationName": "E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University"}, "57201605855": {"Name": "Szab\u00f3 Z.", "AuthorID": "57201605855", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
