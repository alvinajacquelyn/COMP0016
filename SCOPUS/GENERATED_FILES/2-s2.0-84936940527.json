Calmodulin is one of the most abundant presynaptic proteins and it binds Ca2+ faster than any other characterized endogenous neuronal Ca2+ buffer. Direct effects of calmodulin on fast presynaptic Ca2+ dynamics and vesicular release however have not been studied in detail. Using experimentally constrained three-dimensional diffusion modeling of Ca2+ influx-exocytosis coupling at small excitatory synapses we show that, at physiologically relevant concentrations, Ca2+ buffering by calmodulin plays a dominant role in inhibiting vesicular release and in modulating short-term synaptic plasticity. We also propose a novel and potentially powerful mechanism for short-term facilitation based on Ca2+-dependent dynamic dislocation of calmodulin molecules from the plasma membrane within the active zone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium channels", "Modeling biological systems", "Short-term plasticity", "Synaptic transmission", "Synaptic vesicles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936940527", "SubjectAreas": [["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6602184020": {"Name": "Timofeeva Y.", "AuthorID": "6602184020", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complexity Science, University of Warwick"}, "6603211980": {"Name": "Volynski K.", "AuthorID": "6603211980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
