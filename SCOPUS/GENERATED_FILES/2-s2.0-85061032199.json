While the need to assess the plausibility of MAR and to perform sensitivity analyses considering \u201cmissing not at random\u201d (MNAR) scenarios has been emphasized, the practical difficulty of these tasks is rarely acknowledged. With multivariable missingness, what MAR means is difficult to grasp, and in many MNAR scenarios unbiased estimation is possible using methods commonly associated with MAR. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have been proposed as an alternative framework for specifying practically accessible assumptions beyond the MAR-MNAR dichotomy. However, there is currently no general algorithm for deciding how to handle the missing data given a specific DAG. Here we construct \u201ccanonical\u201d DAGs capturing typical missingness mechanisms in epidemiologic studies with incomplete data on exposure, outcome, and confounding factors. For each DAG, we determine whether common target parameters are \u201crecoverable,\u201d meaning that they can be expressed as functions of the available data distribution and thus estimated consistently, or whether sensitivity analyses are necessary. We investigate the performance of available-case and multiple-imputation procedures. Using data from waves 1\u20133 of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (2004\u20132008), we illustrate how our findings can guide the treatment of missing data in point-exposure studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Directed acyclic graphs", "Missing at random assumption", "Missing data", "Missing not at random assumption", "Multiple imputation", "Potential outcomes", "Recoverability", "Sensitivity analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Epidemiologic Methods", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061032199", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"55579918100": {"Name": "Moreno-Betancur M.", "AuthorID": "55579918100", "AffiliationID": "60118547, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne"}, "8216469000": {"Name": "Lee K.J.", "AuthorID": "8216469000", "AffiliationID": "60118549, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Melbourne Medical School, University of Melbourne"}, "7101796739": {"Name": "Carlin J.B.", "AuthorID": "7101796739", "AffiliationID": "60118547, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne"}, "55568943500": {"Name": "Simpson J.A.", "AuthorID": "55568943500", "AffiliationID": "60118547, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne"}, "55795218800": {"Name": "Leacy F.P.", "AuthorID": "55795218800", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Data Science Centre, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "35235524000": {"Name": "White I.R.", "AuthorID": "35235524000", "AffiliationID": "60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit"}}}
