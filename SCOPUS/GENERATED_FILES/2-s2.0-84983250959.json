Using anonymised EMIS-Web data for 139 ethnically diverse general practices (total population 942,511) extracted from the North and East London Commissioning Support Unit, which holds hospital Secondary Uses Services (SUS)-linked data, we examined the prevalence of over-prescribing of short-Acting \u03b2 2-Agonist inhalers (SABA), under-prescribing of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) inhalers and solo prescribing of long-Acting \u03b2 2-Agonists (LABA) to assess the risk of hospitalisation for people with asthma for 1 year ending August 2015. In a total asthma population of 35,864, multivariate analyses in adults showed that the risk of admission increased with greater prescription of SABA inhalers above a baseline of 1-3 (4-12 SABA: odds ratio (OR) 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-2.46, \u00e2 \u00a9 3/413 SABA: OR 3.22; 95% CI 2.04-5.07) with increasing British Thoracic Society step (Step 3: OR 2.90; 95% CI 1.79-4.69, Step 4/5: OR 9.42; 95% CI 5.27-16.84), and among Black (OR 2.30; 95% CI 1.64-3.23) and south Asian adult populations (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.36-2.47). Results in children were similar, but risk of hospitalisation was not related to ethnic group. There is a progressive risk of hospital admission associated with the prescription of more than three SABA inhalers a year. Adults (but not children) from Black and South Asian groups are at an increased risk of admission. Further work is needed to target care for these at-risk groups", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anti-Asthmatic Agents", "Asthma", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Ethnic Groups", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Inappropriate Prescribing", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Primary Health Care", "Risk Factors", "Secondary Care", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983250959", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"21742712000": {"Name": "Hull S.A.", "AuthorID": "21742712000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Effectiveness Group, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "50661358000": {"Name": "Homer K.", "AuthorID": "50661358000", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Effectiveness Group, Centre for Primary Care and Public Health, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57190814627": {"Name": "McKibben S.", "AuthorID": "57190814627", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60111945", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7404756587": {"Name": "Taylor S.J.", "AuthorID": "7404756587", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60111945", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Queen Mary University of London"}, "54903918000": {"Name": "Pike K.", "AuthorID": "54903918000", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60111945", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55228809500": {"Name": "Griffiths C.", "AuthorID": "55228809500", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60111945", "AffiliationName": "Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
