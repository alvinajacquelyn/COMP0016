All rights reserved.We show that the properties of Lagrangian mean curvature flow are a special case of a more general phenomenon, concerning couplings between geometric flows of the ambient space and of totally real submanifolds. Both flows are driven by ambient Ricci curvature or, in the non-K\u00e4hler case, by its analogues. To this end we explore the geometry of totally real submanifolds, defining (i) a new geometric flow in terms of the ambient canonical bundle, (ii) a modified volume functional, further studied in [18], which takes into account the totally real condition. We discuss short-Time existence for our flow and show it couples well with the Streets-Tian symplectic curvature flow for almost K\u00e4hler manifolds. We also discuss possible applications to Lagrangian submanifolds and calibrated geometry.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85088523717", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"20734663500": {"Name": "Lotay J.D.", "AuthorID": "20734663500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "7801655711": {"Name": "Pacini T.", "AuthorID": "7801655711", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Matematica, Universita'di Torino"}}}
