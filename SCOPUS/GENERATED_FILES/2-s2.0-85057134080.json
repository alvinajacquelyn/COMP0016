Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most common form of dementia and is a significant burden for affected patients, carers, and health systems. Great advances have been made in understanding its pathophysiology, to a point that we are moving from a purely clinical diagnosis to a biological one based on the use of biomarkers. Among those, imaging biomarkers are invaluable in Alzheimer\u2019s, as they provide an in vivo window to the pathological processes occurring in Alzheimer\u2019s brain. While some imaging techniques are still under evaluation in the research setting, some have reached widespread clinical use. In this review, we provide an overview of the most commonly used imaging biomarkers in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, from molecular PET imaging to structural MRI, emphasising the concept that multimodal imaging would likely prove to be the optimal tool in the future of Alzheimer\u2019s research and clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "Positron emission tomography (PET)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057134080", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"56196018200": {"Name": "Femminella G.D.", "AuthorID": "56196018200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Imaging Unit, Imperial College London"}, "35068994600": {"Name": "Calsolaro V.", "AuthorID": "35068994600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Imaging Unit, Imperial College London"}, "57204767854": {"Name": "Thayanandan T.", "AuthorID": "57204767854", "AffiliationID": "60012558, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial Memory Unit, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College London"}, "55391030100": {"Name": "Komici K.", "AuthorID": "55391030100", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "9535074800": {"Name": "Corbi G.", "AuthorID": "9535074800", "AffiliationID": "60014096", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Molise"}, "16031800600": {"Name": "Rengo G.", "AuthorID": "16031800600", "AffiliationID": "60172257", "AffiliationName": "Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri SPA\u2014Societ\u00e0 Benefit, IRCCS"}, "35414915500": {"Name": "Ferrara N.", "AuthorID": "35414915500", "AffiliationID": "60172257", "AffiliationName": "Istituti Clinici Scientifici Maugeri SPA\u2014Societ\u00e0 Benefit, IRCCS"}}}
