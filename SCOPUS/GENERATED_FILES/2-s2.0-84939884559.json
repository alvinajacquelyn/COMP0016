Several cellular models exist that monitor the uptake of recombinant \u03b1-syn from the culture medium. Here we established a more physiologically relevant model system in which \u03b1-syn is produced and transferred between mammalian neurons. We generated cell lines expressing either \u03b1-syn tagged with fluorescent proteins or fluorescent tags alone then we co-cultured these cell lines to measure protein uptake. We used live-cell imaging to demonstrate intercellular \u03b1-syn transfer and used flow cytometry and high content analysis to quantify the transfer. We then successfully inhibited intercellular protein transfer genetically by down-regulating dynamin or pharmacologically using dynasore or heparin. In addition, we differentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells carrying a triplication of the \u03b1-syn gene into dopaminergic neurons. These cells secreted high levels of \u03b1-syn, which was taken up by neighboring neurons. Collectively, our co-culture systems provide simple but physiologically relevant tools for the identification of genetic modifiers or small molecules that inhibit \u03b1-syn cell-to-cell transfer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamin", "Dynasore", "Flow cytometry", "HCA", "Heparin", "IPS cells", "Parkinson's disease", "Prion-like", "Synucleinopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Synuclein", "Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Coculture Techniques", "Down-Regulation", "Dynamins", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Flow Cytometry", "Heparin", "Luminescent Proteins", "Mice", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Neuroblastoma", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Protein Transport", "Proteoglycans", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Time Factors", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939884559", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"]], "AuthorData": {"15061774800": {"Name": "Reyes J.", "AuthorID": "15061774800", "AffiliationID": "60018674, 60029170, 60033146", "AffiliationName": "Neuronal Survival Unit, Department of Experimental Medical Science, Wallenberg Neuroscience Center, Lund University"}, "57210401654": {"Name": "Olsson T.", "AuthorID": "57210401654", "AffiliationID": "60027164", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Translational Parkinson's Disease Research, Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute"}, "7007073871": {"Name": "Brundin P.", "AuthorID": "7007073871", "AffiliationID": "60027164", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Translational Parkinson's Disease Research, Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute"}, "56312021500": {"Name": "Lamberts J.", "AuthorID": "56312021500", "AffiliationID": "60027164", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Translational Parkinson's Disease Research, Center for Neurodegenerative Science, Van Andel Research Institute"}, "35889193800": {"Name": "Devine M.", "AuthorID": "35889193800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603182641": {"Name": "Kunath T.", "AuthorID": "6603182641", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, Institute for Stem Cell Research, University of Edinburgh"}}}
