Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.In the context of ongoing debates about the distinctive temporalities associated with contemporary regulative regimes, this paper explores the interpretive trajectories initiated in contrasting conceptualisations of the politics of time. This exploration is developed through analysis of interview data from a study of unconscious relations in academic practice. Section one uses one moment of data to contrast phenomenological, Deleuzian and Lacanian theorisations of the relation between time and subjectivity. Section two is an exegesis of Lacan\u2019s paper on Logical Time. This outlines the way temporality is structured in relation to the subject\u2019s guess about the expectations of the Other. Section three uses this to develop an interpretation of three temporalities that constitute the space of contemporary academic subjectivities. The final section considers the intensification of the juxtaposition of these incongruent temporalities, contrasting Lacanian and Deleuzian theorisations of time in the Real/virtual and their implications for both methodological and political strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["continuity", "Deleuze", "duration", "Lacan", "logical time", "society of control", "Temporality", "urgency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966709757", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"9278364800": {"Name": "Lapping C.", "AuthorID": "9278364800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Culture, Communication and Media, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
