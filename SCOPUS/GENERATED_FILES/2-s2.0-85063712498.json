Congenital hypotonia, breathing difficulties, bulbar weakness, and fatigability had recessive inheritance (homozygous p.R1460W or compound heterozygous p.R1460Q and p.R1059X), whereas carriers were either asymptomatic (p.R1460W) or had myotonia (p.R1460Q). Sodium currents conducted by mutant channels showed unusual mixed defects with both loss-of-function (reduced amplitude, hyperpolarized shift of inactivation) and gain-of-function (slower entry and faster recovery from inactivation) changes.ConclusionsNovel mutations in families with myasthenic congenital myopathy have been identified at p.R1460 of the sodium channel. Recessive inheritance, with experimentally established loss-of-function, is a consistent feature of sodium channel based myasthenia, whereas the mixed gain of function for p.R1460 may also cause susceptibility to myotonia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Electromyography", "Female", "Finland", "Humans", "Laryngismus", "Loss of Function Mutation", "Male", "Muscle Hypotonia", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Mutation, Missense", "Myasthenic Syndromes, Congenital", "Myotonia", "NAV1.4 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Oocytes", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Pedigree", "Whole Exome Sequencing", "Xenopus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063712498", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57208077882": {"Name": "Elia N.", "AuthorID": "57208077882", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Integrative Physiology Program, UCLA"}, "6603260824": {"Name": "Quinonez M.", "AuthorID": "6603260824", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "35148531300": {"Name": "Suominen T.", "AuthorID": "35148531300", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Physiology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "26037209900": {"Name": "Cannon S.C.", "AuthorID": "26037209900", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Integrative Physiology Program, UCLA"}, "55763616300": {"Name": "Shieh P.B.", "AuthorID": "55763616300", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA"}, "6508037568": {"Name": "Palmio J.", "AuthorID": "6508037568", "AffiliationID": "60011170, 60008760", "AffiliationName": "Tampere Neuromuscular Center, Tampere University, University Hospital"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.G.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6507769109": {"Name": "M\u00e4nnikk\u00f6 R.", "AuthorID": "6507769109", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57201719158": {"Name": "Casta\u00f1eda M.S.", "AuthorID": "57201719158", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56091888600": {"Name": "Udd B.", "AuthorID": "56091888600", "AffiliationID": "107453399", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, Vasa Central Hospital"}}}
