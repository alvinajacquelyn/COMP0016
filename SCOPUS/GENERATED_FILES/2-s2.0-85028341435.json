Prevention of virus disease by vaccination or antiviral agents is difficult to achieve. A notable exception was the eradication of human smallpox by vaccination over 30 years ago. Today, humans and animals remain susceptible to poxvirus infections, including zoonotic poxvirus transmission. Here we identified a small molecule, bisbenzimide (bisbenzimidazole), and its derivatives as potent agents against prototypic poxvirus infection in cell culture. We show that bisbenzimide derivatives, which preferentially bind the minor groove of double-stranded DNA, inhibit vaccinia virus infection by blocking viral DNA replication and abrogating postreplicative intermediate and late gene transcription. The bisbenzimide derivatives are potent against vaccinia virus and other poxviruses but ineffective against a range of other DNA and RNA viruses. The bisbenzimide derivatives are the first inhibitors of their class, which appear to directly target the viral genome without affecting cell viability.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiviral agents", "DNA replication", "Poxvirus", "Vaccinia virus", "Viral transcription"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antiviral Agents", "Bisbenzimidazole", "Cell Line", "DNA Replication", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Transcription, Genetic", "Vaccinia virus", "Virus Replication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028341435", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"55357165600": {"Name": "Yakimovich A.", "AuthorID": "55357165600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "35554733800": {"Name": "Greber U.F.", "AuthorID": "35554733800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich"}, "57196478755": {"Name": "Zehnder B.", "AuthorID": "57196478755", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, ETH Zurich"}, "14121881600": {"Name": "Mercer J.", "AuthorID": "14121881600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "55841162600": {"Name": "Huttunen M.", "AuthorID": "55841162600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57195471560": {"Name": "Gould V.", "AuthorID": "57195471560", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6603895290": {"Name": "Coulter L.J.", "AuthorID": "6603895290", "AffiliationID": "60016146", "AffiliationName": "Moredun Research Institute"}, "7006495779": {"Name": "McInnes C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006495779", "AffiliationID": "60016146", "AffiliationName": "Moredun Research Institute"}, "35571132400": {"Name": "Schneider C.", "AuthorID": "35571132400", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, ETH Zurich"}, "7004312740": {"Name": "Kopf M.", "AuthorID": "7004312740", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Health Sciences, Department of Biology, ETH Zurich"}}}
