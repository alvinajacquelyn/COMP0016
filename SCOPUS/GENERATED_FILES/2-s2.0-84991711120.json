Sub-carriers are no longer orthogonally packed in the frequency domain as time samples are only partially transmitted, leading to improved spectral efficiency. In this work, mathematical expressions are derived for the newly proposed Truncated OFDM (TOFDM) signal, followed by interference analysis and performance comparisons. We also consider optimal and practical decoder architectures. Results from a Sphere Decoder-based decoder indicate that truncation length can significantly affect the error performance. With short truncation length, using a purpose designed detector, signals can be recovered even with truncated symbol transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multicarrier modulation", "SEFDM", "Truncated OFDM"], "IndexKeywords": ["Error performance", "Interference analysis", "Mathematical expressions", "Performance comparison", "Practical decoders", "SEFDM", "Spectral efficiencies", "White Gaussian Noise"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991711120", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"57191579684": {"Name": "Ozan W.", "AuthorID": "57191579684", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7007149717": {"Name": "Jamieson K.", "AuthorID": "7007149717", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Princeton University"}}}
