When employing regression testing it is often desirable to reduce the number of test cases executed in order to achieve a certain objective; a process known as test suite minimisation. We use multi-objective optimisation to analyse the trade-off between code coverage and execution time for the test suite of Mockito, a popular framework used to create mock objects for unit tests in Java. We show that a large reduction can be made in terms of execution time at the expense of only a small reduction in code coverage and discuss how the described methods can be easily applied to many projects that utilise regression testing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Code coverage", "Large software systems", "Minimisation", "Mock objects", "Multi objective", "Regression testing", "Regression tests", "Small reduction"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989918964", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57214526742": {"Name": "Turner A.", "AuthorID": "57214526742", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics, University of York"}, "55538156100": {"Name": "White D.", "AuthorID": "55538156100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CREST, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55360588500": {"Name": "Drake J.", "AuthorID": "55360588500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "The OR Group, School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
