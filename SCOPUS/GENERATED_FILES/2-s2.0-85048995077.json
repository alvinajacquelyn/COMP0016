The discovery of such genes has enabled more precise diagnosis of these disorders and the development of specific therapeutic approaches that target the genetic basis and pathophysiological pathways. Such translational research has led to the approval of two genetic therapies by the US Food and Drug Administration: eteplirsen for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and nusinersen for spinal muscular atrophy, which are both antisense oligonucleotides that modify pre-mRNA splicing. In this Review we aim to discuss new genetic therapies and ongoing clinical trials for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, and other less common childhood neuromuscular disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Morpholinos", "Muscular Atrophy, Spinal", "Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne", "Neuromuscular Diseases", "Oligonucleotides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048995077", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"55675111500": {"Name": "Scoto M.", "AuthorID": "55675111500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7102038246": {"Name": "Muntoni F.", "AuthorID": "7102038246", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Great Ormond Street Hospital Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7006041140": {"Name": "Finkel R.", "AuthorID": "7006041140", "AffiliationID": "60134712, 60026523", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Neurology, Nemours Children's Hospital, University of Central Florida College of Medicine"}, "57211220608": {"Name": "Mercuri E.", "AuthorID": "57211220608", "AffiliationID": "60073799, 60031984", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Neurology and Centro Nemo, IRCSS Fondazione Policlinico Gemelli, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"}}}
