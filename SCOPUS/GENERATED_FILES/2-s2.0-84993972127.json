Existing robot patrol routing strategies are not suitable, as they omit the peculiarities and challenges of daily police patrol including minimising the average time lag between two consecutive visits to hotspots, as well as coordinating multiple patrollers and imparting unpredictability to patrol routes. In this research, we propose a set of guidelines for patrol routing strategies to meet the challenges of police patrol. Following these guidelines, we develop an innovative heuristic-based and Bayesian-inspired real-time strategy for cooperative routing police patrols. Using two real-world cases and a benchmark patrol strategy, an online agent-based simulation has been implemented to testify the efficiency, flexibility, scalability, unpredictability, and robustness of the proposed strategy and the usability of the proposed guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based modelling", "Ant colony algorithm", "Bayesian-based decision making", "Multi-agent patrol routing", "Police patrols"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agent-based modelling", "Ant colony algorithms", "Bayesian", "Multi agent", "Police patrols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84993972127", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecological Modeling", "ENVI", "2302"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57191834457": {"Name": "Chen H.", "AuthorID": "57191834457", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "35200522100": {"Name": "Cheng T.", "AuthorID": "35200522100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57197263285": {"Name": "Wise S.", "AuthorID": "57197263285", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084282", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London"}}}
