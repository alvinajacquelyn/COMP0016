While accurate, these assessments are time-consuming and expensive. Using digital records of behavior to assess personality may offer an alternative solution to overcome these limitations. In this study, we explore whether the \u201cdark side\u201d of personality (non-clinical dysfunctional dispositions) can be inferred through the language used in Facebook Status Updates. Using the Hogan Development Survey (HDS), machine learning methods, and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, language use was found to hold a relationship with HDS scores. The Excitable, Dutiful and Bold scales held the strongest relationship with language (R = 0.27, 0.25 & 0.22, respectively), while the Cautious, Colorful and Leisurely scales held the weakest relationship (R = 0.06, 0.07, & 0.08, respectively). This study extends previous research by demonstrating that the full spectrum of dysfunctional dispositions can be measured using online language. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital records", "Language", "Personality", "Psychometrics", "Social media"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047425833", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55450595700": {"Name": "Akhtar R.", "AuthorID": "55450595700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "8244744300": {"Name": "Chamorro-Premuzic T.", "AuthorID": "8244744300", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Teachers College, Columbia University"}, "56026560500": {"Name": "Winsborough D.", "AuthorID": "56026560500", "AffiliationID": "117861547", "AffiliationName": "Winsborough Limited"}, "57202200068": {"Name": "Johnson A.", "AuthorID": "57202200068", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Teachers College, Columbia University"}, "57202192837": {"Name": "Ort U.", "AuthorID": "57202192837", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Teachers College, Columbia University"}}}
