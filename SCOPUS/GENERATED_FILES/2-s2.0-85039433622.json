The subsequent discussion does not catalogue all relevant technical literature. Instead, it intends to convey the state of background knowledge, recommendations and code rules using some illustrative examples. A specific focus is given to visual inspection as a fundamental first step for all different scopes and levels of assessment. The objectives of this review are to: (1) highlight the gaps and limitations in the currently available tools as well as the need for standardization; (2) contribute to the definition of an ontological approach, relating the scope of the assessment, information required and necessary procedures, (3) identify guidance for the different scopes of the assessment. The variety of timber species, architectural typologies and structural solutions, together with the varied response of these structures to climatic and other natural and man-made hazards, warrant a multifaceted and integrated assessment methodology that accounts for the hierarchical nature of timber structures behaviour and the multitude of agents affecting such behaviour. A review of existing standards and guidelines illustrates the need for a tool to consistently record the assessment process and the final decision taken, which will serve to constitute the knowledge base for the development of the next generation of more integrated and heritage specific guidelines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Guidelines", "Heritage timber structures", "Standards", "Visual inspection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039433622", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Materials Science (miscellaneous)", "MATE", "2501"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"24345235700": {"Name": "Riggio M.", "AuthorID": "24345235700", "AffiliationID": "60013402", "AffiliationName": "Oregon State University, Department WSE"}, "57211644046": {"Name": "D'Ayala D.", "AuthorID": "57211644046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department CEGE"}, "7102729895": {"Name": "Parisi M.A.", "AuthorID": "7102729895", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Milano, Department ABC"}, "36722440800": {"Name": "Tardini C.", "AuthorID": "36722440800", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Milano, Department ABC"}}}
