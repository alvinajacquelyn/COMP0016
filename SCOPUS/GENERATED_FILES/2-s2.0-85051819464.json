We did so in a longitudinal study of English-speaking children (N = 70). At 5\u20137 years of age, children completed the metalinguistic measures along with control measures of phonological awareness and vocabulary. Children completed the reading measures 2 years later. Morphological awareness but not prosodic sensitivity made a significant independent contribution to word reading, text reading accuracy, and reading comprehension. The effects of morphological awareness on reading comprehension remained after controls for word reading. These results suggest that morphological awareness needs to be considered seriously in models of reading development and that prosodic sensitivity might have primarily indirect relations to reading outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051819464", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"]], "AuthorData": {"9233069700": {"Name": "Deacon S.H.", "AuthorID": "9233069700", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University"}, "26539964700": {"Name": "Holliman A.J.", "AuthorID": "26539964700", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University"}, "57205194588": {"Name": "Dobson G.J.", "AuthorID": "57205194588", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University"}, "56291050200": {"Name": "Harrison E.C.J.", "AuthorID": "56291050200", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University"}}}
