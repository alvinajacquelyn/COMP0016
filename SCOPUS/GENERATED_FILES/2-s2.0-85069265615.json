Here, a novel HS comprising 0D perovskite CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) and 2D material topological insulator Bi2Se3 film is proposed and experimentally investigated. Specifically, steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements are employed, from which a significant quenching behaviour is observed in the HS, with an average quenching factor of 93.2 \u00b10.8%. Additionally, time-resolved PL spectroscopy affirms that the carrier transfer efficiency can be up to 92.6 \u00b10.2%. Furthermore, the dynamics of carrier transfer within the 0D-2D HS are characterized by utilizing femtosecond broadband transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, revealing an ultrafast exciton transfer from photoexcited CsPbBr3 QDs to the Bi2Se3 film with a time-scale around 1.1 \u00b10.2 ps. An alternative important finding is that the band renormalization is exhibited in CsPbBr3 QDs of the HS, with the dominant factor being the Coulomb screening effect. This work is expected to provide some fundamental understanding of the ultrafast and efficient carrier transfer mechanism underneath HSs based on topological insulators.", "AuthorKeywords": ["energy transfer", "heterostructure", "perovskite", "topological insulator", "ultrafast measurement"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coulomb screening", "Hetero interfaces", "Metallic surface", "Quenching factors", "Research interests", "Time-resolved photoluminescence", "Transient absorption", "Ultrafast measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069265615", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57203747260": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203747260", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defence Technology"}, "35590198700": {"Name": "Jiang T.", "AuthorID": "35590198700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Centre of Quantum Information, National University of Defence Technology"}, "57190745721": {"Name": "Wei K.", "AuthorID": "57190745721", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defence Technology"}, "57193228861": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57193228861", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defence Technology"}, "55598164400": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "55598164400", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defence Technology"}, "7401753972": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "7401753972", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defence Technology"}, "57200242626": {"Name": "Zhou T.", "AuthorID": "57200242626", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, College of Computer, National University of Defence Technology"}, "57209619106": {"Name": "Hao H.", "AuthorID": "57209619106", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, College of Computer, National University of Defence Technology"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defence Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "57221406260": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57221406260", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defence Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "36571054700": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "36571054700", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Innovation Institute of Defence Technology, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}}}
