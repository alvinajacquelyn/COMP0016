Karger AG, Basel.Is there an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cognitive profile, i.e. a consistent, disorder-specific pattern of cognitive peaks and troughs found in a substantial proportion of people with ASD? Almost all research into ASD cognition is not designed to answer this question, as studies tend to focus on specific aspects of cognition without providing a broad picture across multiple cognitive domains and because results are reported as group trends without sufficient attention to individual patterns of performance. Thus, it is not currently known whether there is an ASD cognitive profile. To fill this gap in the literature, there is a need for multiple single-case study designs, which investigate individual patterns of relative peaks and troughs across diverse cognitive tests for multiple participants. We illustrate this approach using data from the 10 subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - fourth edition (WISC-IV), in a sample of 104 young people with an ASD. Initial group level analyses suggested that, on average, people with ASD have relative strengths in WISC-IV tasks requiring non-timed abstract reasoning and relative weaknesses in processing speed and comprehension. However, these group level findings did not consistently apply to individual participants: only 1 person in the sample of 104 had an individual profile that reflected the group level pattern of strengths and weaknesses. Nevertheless, non-specific variability was common, with 76% of the sample showing significant peaks and troughs in performance on the WISC-IV subtests, raising the possibility that a key characteristic of ASD is unpredictable cognitive heterogeneity, characterized by relative strengths as well as difficulties.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929161247", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"9743239400": {"Name": "Mandy W.", "AuthorID": "9743239400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology and Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "23088747000": {"Name": "Murin M.", "AuthorID": "23088747000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7004857206": {"Name": "Skuse D.", "AuthorID": "7004857206", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
