Their adjustable band gap and facile processing offer great potential for discovery and development. Here, we present a series of CTF-0 materials fabricated by two different approaches, a microwave-assisted synthesis and an ionothermal method, for water splitting driven by visible-light irradiation. The material (CTF-0-M2) synthesized by microwave technology shows a high photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution (up to 7010 \u03bcmol h-1 g-1), which is 7 times higher than another (CTF-0-I) prepared by conventional ionothermal trimerization under identical photocatalytic conditions. This leads to a high turnover number (TON) of 726 with respect to the platinum cocatalyst after seven cycles under visible light. We attribute this to the narrowed band gap, the most negative conduction band, and the rapid photogenerated charge separation and transfer. On the other hand, the material prepared by the ionothermal method is the most efficient one for oxygen evolution. CTF-0-I initially produces ca. 6 times greater volumes of oxygen gas than CTF-0-M2 under identical experimental conditions. CTF-0-I presents an apparent quantum efficiency (AQY) of 5.2% at 420 nm for oxygen production without any cocatalyst. The activity for water oxidation exceeds that of most reported CTFs due to a large driving force for oxidation and a large number of active sites. Our findings indicate that the band positions and the interlayer stacking structures of CTF-0 were modulated by varying synthesis conditions. These modulations impact the optical and redox properties, resulting in an enhanced performance for photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution, confirmed by first-principles calculations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["covalent triazine-based frameworks", "hydrogen evolution", "oxygen evolution", "visible-light-driven photocatalysis", "water splitting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Covalent triazine-based frameworks", "Hydrogen evolution", "Oxygen evolution", "Visible-light-driven", "Water splitting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070578258", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56647439100": {"Name": "Kong D.", "AuthorID": "56647439100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194506415": {"Name": "Xie J.", "AuthorID": "57194506415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57007819400": {"Name": "Ruan Q.", "AuthorID": "57007819400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55184698200": {"Name": "Windle C.D.", "AuthorID": "55184698200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57207806567": {"Name": "Bai Z.", "AuthorID": "57207806567", "AffiliationID": "60013789", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Beihang University"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56328578400": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "56328578400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36664352000": {"Name": "Gadipelli S.", "AuthorID": "36664352000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57207769958": {"Name": "Shen K.", "AuthorID": "57207769958", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
