However, until recently, few have considered how neural circuitry develops the effective social bonds that are subsequently replicated in relationships across the lifespan. This current cross-sectional study undertook a fMRI Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) meta-analyses to examine the neurocircuitry that governs emotional and behavioural functions critical for building effective social relationships in children and adults. Results suggest that dissociable dorsal cognitive (\u201ccool\u201d) and ventral \u2013 affective (\u201chot\u201d) frontal-subcortical circuits (FSC) work together to govern social relationships, with repeated social consequences leading to potentially adaptive \u2013 or maladaptive \u2013 relationships that can become routinized in the cerebellum. Implications for forming stable, functional, social bonds are considered, followed by recommendations for those who struggle with cool and hot FSC functioning that can hinder the development of adaptive prosocial relationships.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cool and hot executive functions", "Executive social control", "Frontal subcortical circuitry", "Functional neuroimaging", "Meta-analysis", "Social attachment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Child", "Empathy", "Executive Function", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Object Attachment", "Reward", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014628134", "SubjectAreas": [["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55004076000": {"Name": "Lee S.", "AuthorID": "55004076000", "AffiliationID": "60005510", "AffiliationName": "Psychology, Nanyang Technological University"}, "7202307955": {"Name": "Hale J.", "AuthorID": "7202307955", "AffiliationID": "118202293", "AffiliationName": "Center for Teaching Brain Literacy"}, "7410263846": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "7410263846", "AffiliationID": "60005510, 60118633", "AffiliationName": "Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), Nanyang Technological University"}, "57002919200": {"Name": "Walker Z.", "AuthorID": "57002919200", "AffiliationID": "60010940", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Education"}}}
