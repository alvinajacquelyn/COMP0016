A hydrothermal route incorporating pre-formed nanoparticles was used, and their physical and chemical properties evaluated by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric and elemental analyses. These polymers are easily synthesised from an industrial waste material, elemental sulphur, can be cast into virtually any form and as such represent a new class of materials designed for a responsible energy future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934907393", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"51160971600": {"Name": "Bear J.C.", "AuthorID": "51160971600", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Energy Safety Research Institute, Swansea University, Bay Campus"}, "15053182500": {"Name": "Dunnill C.W.", "AuthorID": "15053182500", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Energy Safety Research Institute, Swansea University, Bay Campus"}, "55659162000": {"Name": "Peveler W.J.", "AuthorID": "55659162000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35221969500": {"Name": "McNaughter P.D.", "AuthorID": "35221969500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Manchester"}, "23103639300": {"Name": "O'Brien P.", "AuthorID": "23103639300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}}}
