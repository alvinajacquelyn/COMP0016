Patients and Methods In all, 20 patients (19 male and one female) with a mean (sd; range) age of 57.2 (12.4; 31.0-78.2) years underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC). Most cases were \u2264pT1 (17 patients) and the remaining three patients had muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) at RARC histopathology. Although half of the patients (10) actually had MIBC at transurethral resection histopathology. All patients underwent RARC, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and intracorporeal neobladder formation using a pyramid detubularised folding pouch configuration. Results The median estimated blood loss was 250 mL and operating time was 5.5 h. The mean (sd) number of lymph nodes removed was 16.5 (7.8) and median hospital stay was 10 days. Early postoperative complications included urinary tract infection (UTI) (four patients), ileus (four), diarrhoea and vomiting (three), postoperative collection (two), and blocked stent (one). Late postoperative complications included UTI (seven patients), neobladder stone (two), voiding Hem-o-Loc (two), neobladder leak (two), diarrhoea and vomiting (one), uretero-ileal stricture (one), vitamin B12 deficiency (one), and port-site hernia (one). There was no evidence of hydronephrosis in 18 patients with a median follow-up of 21.5 months. At 24 months, recurrence-free survival was 86% and overall survival was 100%. In all, 19 patients and 13 patients reported 6-month day time and night time continence, respectively. Conclusions The pyramid neobladder is technically feasible using a robotic platform and provides satisfactory functional outcomes at median of 21.5 months.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bladder cancer", "cystectomy", "intracorporeal", "neobladder", "robot-assisted", "urinary diversion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carcinoma, Transitional Cell", "Cystectomy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Operative Time", "Postoperative Complications", "Robotics", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Urinary Diversion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943580145", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57201942956": {"Name": "Tan W.S.", "AuthorID": "57201942956", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "56355040200": {"Name": "Sridhar A.", "AuthorID": "56355040200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "14017891400": {"Name": "Goldstraw M.", "AuthorID": "14017891400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "24765500600": {"Name": "Zacharakis E.", "AuthorID": "24765500600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "56545193700": {"Name": "Nathan S.", "AuthorID": "56545193700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "7201521878": {"Name": "Hines J.", "AuthorID": "7201521878", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "9739106900": {"Name": "Cathcart P.", "AuthorID": "9739106900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "7004395429": {"Name": "Briggs T.", "AuthorID": "7004395429", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Hospital"}}}
