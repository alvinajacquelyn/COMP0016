The aim of the current study is to identify novel genes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease using the largest up-to-date reference single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel, the most accurate imputation software and a novel gene-based analysis approach which tests for patterns of association within genes, in the powerful genome-wide association dataset of the International Genomics of Alzheimer\u2019s Project Consortium, comprising over 7 million genotypes from 17,008 Alzheimer\u2019s cases and 37,154 controls. In addition to earlier reported genes, we detected three novel gene-wide significant loci PPARGC1A (p = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u22126), RORA (p = 7.4 \u00d7 10\u22127) and ZNF423 (p = 2.1 \u00d7 10\u22126). PPARGC1A and RORA are involved in circadian rhythm; circadian disturbances are one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. PPARGC1A is additionally linked to energy metabolism and the generation of amyloid beta plaques. RORA is involved in a variety of functions apart from circadian rhythm, such as cholesterol metabolism and inflammation. The ZNF423 gene resides in an Alzheimer\u2019s disease-specific protein network and is likely involved with centrosomes and DNA damage repair.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer
