In this paper, we propose a new low-rank spectral nonlocal approach (LRSNL) to the simultaneous removal of a mixture of different types of noises, such as Gaussian noises, salt and pepper impulse noises, and fixed-pattern noises including stripes and dead pixel lines. The low-rank (LR) property is exploited to obtain precleaned patches, which can then be better clustered in our spectral nonlocal method (SNL). The SNL method takes both spectral and spatial information into consideration to remove mixed noises as well as preserve the fine structures of images. Experiments on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that LRSNL, although simple, is an effective approach to the restoration of HSI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hyperspectral image", "low rank (LR)", "nonlocal means", "restoration", "spectral and spatial information"], "IndexKeywords": ["Effective approaches", "Hyper-spectral images", "low rank (LR)", "Non-local means", "Salt-and-pepper impulse noise", "Simultaneous removal", "Spatial informations", "Synthetic and real data"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027938848", "SubjectAreas": [["Computers in Earth Sciences", "EART", "1903"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"56433914500": {"Name": "Zhu R.", "AuthorID": "56433914500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "57195451262": {"Name": "Dong M.", "AuthorID": "57195451262", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7202881908": {"Name": "Xue J.", "AuthorID": "7202881908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
