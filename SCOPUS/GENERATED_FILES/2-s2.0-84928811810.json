Despite that trait, their complex internal structure makes them strong and exceptional insulators. Silica aerogel is so full of holes that it is typically 99.8 percent air and has a density only three times greater than air, which means that it has practically no weight at all. At the same time, when placed against a dark background silica aerogel is undoubtedly blue. And yet, because it is made from clear glass, it ought to have no color at all. Aerogel foams have other interesting properties, the most remarkable of which is their thermal insulation, their ability to act as a barrier against heat. Because it is a foam, aerogel has within it the equivalent of a billion billion layers of glass and air between one side of the material and the other. This is what makes it such a superb thermal insulator. NASA built an entire space mission around the ability of aerogel to gently collect stardust. Research on developing new aerogels has been taking place at an increasingly rapid pace. There are now a number of aerogel technologies that result in a material that is not rigid and brittle, as silica aerogels are, but flexible and bendy. These so-called x-aerogels are made flexible by a neat piece of chemistry that detaches the rigid foam walls of an aerogel from one another and inserts between them polymer molecules that act like hinges within the material.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Trade Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928811810", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55827028600": {"Name": "Miodownik M.", "AuthorID": "55827028600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Making, University College London"}}}
