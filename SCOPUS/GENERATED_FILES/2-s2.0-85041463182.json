We propose the theoretical lifetime extraction of perovskite solar cells with a mixed-cations lead halide perovskite absorber containing CH3NH3+, CH3(NH2)2+ and Cs+. The estimated mean time to failure (MTTF) of the triple cation perovskite solar cells is up to 180 days in ambient. Compared with the perovskite solar cells based on CH3NH3PbI3, the triple-cation perovskite solar cells, whose power conversion efficiency reaches 18.2% in this study, have a much better performance in terms of thermal stability and humidity stability. Improvements of both performance and stability pave the way for commercialization of perovskite solar cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Humidity stability", "Perovskite solar cells", "Reliability", "Thermal stability", "Triple-cation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental demonstrations", "Halide perovskites", "High power conversion", "Mean time to failure", "Organic-inorganic", "Performance degradation", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Thermal phase transition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041463182", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"57189871235": {"Name": "Zhang R.", "AuthorID": "57189871235", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57192198429": {"Name": "Liu D.", "AuthorID": "57192198429", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "55733853200": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55733853200", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "56990540700": {"Name": "Zhang T.", "AuthorID": "56990540700", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57192201099": {"Name": "Gu X.", "AuthorID": "57192201099", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57219324275": {"Name": "Zhang P.", "AuthorID": "57219324275", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "57216471973": {"Name": "Chen Z.D.", "AuthorID": "57216471973", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Center for Nanoscale Science & Engineering, University of Kentucky"}, "54079892300": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "54079892300", "AffiliationID": "60005465", "AffiliationName": "School of Optoelectronic Information, State Key Laboratory of Electronic Thin Films and Integrated Devices, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57216268515": {"Name": "Zhao Y.", "AuthorID": "57216268515", "AffiliationID": "118039707", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Haidian District Vocational School"}}}
