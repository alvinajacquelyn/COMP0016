This progress has drawn the attention of cognitive scientists interested in understanding human learning. However, the concern has been raised that deep RL may be too sample-inefficient \u2013 that is, it may simply be too slow \u2013 to provide a plausible model of how humans learn. In the present review, we counter this critique by describing recently developed techniques that allow deep RL to operate more nimbly, solving problems much more quickly than previous methods. Although these techniques were developed in an AI context, we propose that they may have rich implications for psychology and neuroscience. A key insight, arising from these AI methods, concerns the fundamental connection between fast RL and slower, more incremental forms of learning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Human learning", "Human performance", "Plausible model", "Reinforcement learning method", "Animals", "Artificial Intelligence", "Humans", "Memory, Episodic", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Reinforcement, Psychology", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064325421", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"6602977616": {"Name": "Botvinick M.", "AuthorID": "6602977616", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190617457": {"Name": "Ritter S.", "AuthorID": "57190617457", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Princeton University"}, "57203559163": {"Name": "Wang J.X.", "AuthorID": "57203559163", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "21833994400": {"Name": "Kurth-Nelson Z.", "AuthorID": "21833994400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "53063236700": {"Name": "Blundell C.", "AuthorID": "53063236700", "AffiliationID": "60111161", "AffiliationName": "DeepMind"}, "15839738700": {"Name": "Hassabis D.", "AuthorID": "15839738700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
