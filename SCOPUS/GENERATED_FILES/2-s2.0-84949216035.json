This study aimed to contribute to our understanding of the experience of dementia from a relational perspective. Seven couples, in which one person had a diagnosis of dementia, were interviewed about their experience of being in a couple where one partner had a diagnosis of dementia. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, five master themes were identified, which illustrated how couples constructed their experience of dementia in order to make sense of it, and describe the processes that they adopt in order to adjust to dementia. Findings were supported by existing empirical and theoretical literature and suggest that services and interventions could be enhanced if a relational understanding of dementia were more fully considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["couples", "dementia", "interpretive phenomenological analysis", "qualitative research", "relationships"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Caregivers", "Dementia", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Qualitative Research", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949216035", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55532245200": {"Name": "Merrick K.", "AuthorID": "55532245200", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "35267762400": {"Name": "Camic P.M.", "AuthorID": "35267762400", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Centre for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "57214299965": {"Name": "O\u2019Shaughnessy M.", "AuthorID": "57214299965", "AffiliationID": "60176016", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Service for Older People, Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust"}}}
