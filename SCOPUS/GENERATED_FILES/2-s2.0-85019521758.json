Ultrasound imaging is often used to guide minimally invasive procedures, as it can provide real-time visualization of patient anatomy and medical devices. However, this modality can provide low image contrast for soft tissues, and poor visualization of medical devices that are steeply angled with respect to the incoming ultrasound beams. Photoacoustic sensors can provide information about the spatial distributions of tissue chromophores that could be valuable for guiding minimally invasive procedures. In this study, a system for guiding minimally invasive procedures using photoacoustic sensing was developed. This system included a miniature photoacoustic probe with three optical fibers: one with a bare end for photoacoustic excitation of tissue, a second for photoacoustic excitation of an optically absorbing coating at the distal end to transmit ultrasound, and a third with a Fabry-P\u00e9rot cavity at the distal end for receiving ultrasound. The position of the photoacoustic probe was determined with ultrasonic tracking, which involved transmitting pulses from a linear-array ultrasound imaging probe at the tissue surface, and receiving them with the fiber-optic ultrasound receiver in the photoacoustic probe. The axial resolution of photoacoustic sensing was better than 70 \u03bcm, and the tracking accuracy was better than 1 mm in both axial and lateral dimensions. By translating the photoacoustic probe, depth scans were obtained from different spatial positions, and two-dimensional images were reconstructed using a frequency-domain algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fiber optic", "Minimally invasive procedures", "Photoacoustic imaging", "Ultrasonic tracking", "Ultrasound imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Frequency domain algorithm", "Minimally invasive", "Photo-acoustic imaging", "Photoacoustic excitation", "Photoacoustic sensors", "Real time visualization", "Two dimensional images", "Ultrasound imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019521758", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"36337500900": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "36337500900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003418009": {"Name": "Mosse C.A.", "AuthorID": "7003418009", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56150220800": {"Name": "Colchester R.J.", "AuthorID": "56150220800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "24344561500": {"Name": "Mari J.M.", "AuthorID": "24344561500", "AffiliationID": "60072725", "AffiliationName": "GePaSud, University of French Polynesia"}, "57188642825": {"Name": "Nikitichev D.I.", "AuthorID": "57188642825", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.C.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55820371500": {"Name": "West S.J.", "AuthorID": "55820371500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Main Theatres, University College Hospital"}}}
