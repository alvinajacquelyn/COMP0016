Karger AG, Basel.Initially described as an uncommon presenting feature of Sotos syndrome (SoS), over the last decades, congenital hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (CHI) has been increasingly reported in association with this condition. The mechanism responsible for CHI in SoS is unclear. We report the case of a neonate presenting with CHI and extensive venous and arterial thrombosis associated with kidney, heart, liver, skeleton, and brain abnormalities and finally diagnosed with SoS on whole genome sequencing. Our case describes an extended phenotype associated with SoS presenting with CHI (including thrombosis and liver dysfunction) and reinforces the association of transient CHI with SoS. The case also shows that an early neonatal diagnosis of rare genetic conditions is challenging, especially in acutely unwell patients, and that in complex cases with incomplete, atypical, or overlapping phenotypes, broad genomic testing by whole exome or whole genome sequencing may be a useful diagnostic strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Congenital hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia", "Liver dysfunction", "Rapid whole genome sequencing", "Sotos syndrome", "Thrombosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Hyperinsulinism", "Hypoglycemia", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Newborn, Diseases", "Male", "Sotos Syndrome", "Thrombosis", "Whole Genome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063322522", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"35329107200": {"Name": "Cerbone M.", "AuthorID": "35329107200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health London"}, "23988495800": {"Name": "Gilbert C.", "AuthorID": "23988495800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.T.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Genetics and Epigenetics in Health and Disease, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Program, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health London"}, "55936859700": {"Name": "Shah P.", "AuthorID": "55936859700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, UCL GOS Institute of Child Health"}, "7006362106": {"Name": "Clement E.", "AuthorID": "7006362106", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202860760": {"Name": "Hurst J.", "AuthorID": "7202860760", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57218121629": {"Name": "Mcclatchey M.", "AuthorID": "57218121629", "AffiliationID": "60007800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Barking Havering and Redbridge Trust"}, "57201188264": {"Name": "Dobbin J.", "AuthorID": "57201188264", "AffiliationID": "60007800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Barking Havering and Redbridge Trust"}, "10143797300": {"Name": "Keane M.", "AuthorID": "10143797300", "AffiliationID": "60007800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Barking Havering and Redbridge Trust"}, "57189056211": {"Name": "Boukhibar L.", "AuthorID": "57189056211", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "GOSgene, Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health London"}, "35380179700": {"Name": "Williams H.", "AuthorID": "35380179700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "GOSgene, Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health London"}, "40261293100": {"Name": "Gagunashvili A.", "AuthorID": "40261293100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "GOSgene, Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health London"}}}
