Neurogastroenterology & Motility Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Enteric neuropathies exist as a wide range of human disorders which impact on gastrointestinal motility. Current standard therapies for enteric neuropathies are limited to surgical resection or manipulation (eg, myotomy) of affected gut segments or medical management including both therapy (eg, prokinetic pharmacotherapy) and support such as parenteral nutrition. However, such treatments often result in poor prognosis and significant morbidity. The current limitations in treatment options for enteric neuropathies underline the need for alternative approaches to treat these devastating diseases. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of enteric neural stem cells as a possible treatment option for regenerative medicine, in such cases. Purpose: The purpose of this review is to provide an up-to-date synopsis of the enteric neural stem cell research field. Here, we review in detail the initial characterization of enteric neural stem cells, early preclinical studies validating their use in murine models through to the most recent findings of therapeutic rescue of diseased gut tissue. We additionally pose a number of questions regarding these recent findings which will need to be addressed prior to clinical translation of this exciting cellular therapeutic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["enteric nervous system", "enteric neural stem cell", "enteric neuropathy", "stem cell", "transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction", "Neural Stem Cells", "Stem Cell Transplantation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046079532", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"36813572200": {"Name": "McCann C.J.", "AuthorID": "36813572200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "8337607800": {"Name": "Thapar N.", "AuthorID": "8337607800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
