Surgery affords the best prospect of cure. We present our experience of the surgical management of ADFs at a specialist unit, highlighting operative techniques, challenges and assess clinical outcomes following intervention. We also illustrate findings of a Hospital Episodes Statistics search for ADFs. Methods: A prospectively-maintained database was searched to identify all patients diagnosed with an ADF who were managed at our institution. Of 48 patients with an ADF, eight underwent surgical intervention. Results: Four patients underwent an exploration of the ADF with primary repair of the defect. Two of these patients had proximal ADFs, amenable to repair through a neck incision, and two required a thoracotomy. Two patients suffered fistulae secondary to endoscopic therapy and underwent oesophageal exclusion surgery, with subsequent staged reconstruction. Two patients with previous Tuberculosis had a lung segmentectomy and lobectomy respectively, and a further patient in remission after treatment for lymphoma underwent oesophageal resection with synchronous reconstruction. Three patients suffered a complication, with one post-operative mortality. The remaining seven patients all achieved normal oral alimentation, with no evidence of ADF recurrence at a median follow-up of 32months. Conclusions: Surgery to manage ADFs is effective in restoring normal alimentation and alleviates soiling of the airway, with a very low risk of recurrence. Several operative techniques can be utilised dependent on the features of the ADF. Early referral to specialist units is advocated, where the expertise to facilitate the complete management of patients is present, within a multi-disciplinary setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aerodigestive fistula", "Oesophageal cancer", "Oesophageal surgery", "Tracheo-oesophageal fistula"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Esophageal Fistula", "Esophagectomy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pneumonectomy", "Recurrence", "Respiratory Tract Fistula", "Retrospective Studies", "Thoracotomy", "Tracheoesophageal Fistula"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056614139", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"24460308700": {"Name": "Qureshi Y.A.", "AuthorID": "24460308700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital, Department of Oesophago-Gastric Surgery"}, "57202678274": {"Name": "Muntzer Mughal M.", "AuthorID": "57202678274", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital, Department of Oesophago-Gastric Surgery"}, "56637945600": {"Name": "Mohammadi B.", "AuthorID": "56637945600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital, Department of Oesophago-Gastric Surgery"}, "25223814300": {"Name": "Markar S.R.", "AuthorID": "25223814300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Department of Surgery and Cancer"}, "7403557850": {"Name": "George J.", "AuthorID": "7403557850", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital, Department of Thoracic Medicine"}, "7102577407": {"Name": "Hayward M.", "AuthorID": "7102577407", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital, Department of Thoracic Surgery"}, "7402207154": {"Name": "Lawrence D.", "AuthorID": "7402207154", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital, Department of Thoracic Surgery"}}}
