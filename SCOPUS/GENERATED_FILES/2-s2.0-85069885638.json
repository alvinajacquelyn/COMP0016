These changes, and whether they are reversible (reverse remodeling), are major determinants of timing and outcome from transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement. Cardiac changes in response to AS afterload can either be adaptive and reversible, or maladaptive and irreversible, when they may convey residual risk after intervention. Structural and hemodynamic assessment of AS therefore needs to evaluate more than the valve, and, in particular, the myocardial remodeling response. Imaging plays a key role in this. This review assesses how multimodality imaging evaluates AS myocardial hypertrophy and its components (cellular hypertrophy, fibrosis, microvascular changes, and additional features such as cardiac amyloid) both before and after intervention, and seeks to highlight how care and outcomes in AS could be improved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aortic stenosis", "aortic valve replacement", "myocardial fibrosis", "myocardial hypertrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aortic Valve Stenosis", "Echocardiography", "Fibrosis", "Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Multimodal Imaging", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069885638", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57160021700": {"Name": "Badiani S.", "AuthorID": "57160021700", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "55645073800": {"Name": "Lloyd G.", "AuthorID": "55645073800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
