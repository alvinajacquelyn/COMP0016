In this article we propose that link-layer connectivity can be associated with information availability and in this respect connectivity decisions should be information-aware. To achieve information awareness at the link layer, we leverage on the information-centric networking paradigm and introduce the concept of information-centric connectivity (ICCON). We elaborate on different types of information availability and connectivity decisions in the context of ICCON, present specific use cases, and discuss emerging opportunities, challenges, and technical approaches. We illustrate the potential benefits of ICCON through preliminary simulation and numerical results in an example use case.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Information availability", "Information awareness", "Information-aware", "Information-centric", "Information-centric networkings", "Numerical results", "Potential benefits", "Wireless medium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991075521", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57188821228": {"Name": "Katsaros K.", "AuthorID": "57188821228", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019507", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Athens University of Economics and Business"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019507", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Athens University of Economics and Business"}, "15726695000": {"Name": "Sourlas V.", "AuthorID": "15726695000", "AffiliationID": "60031155, 60025812", "AffiliationName": "Computer Engineering Department, University of Patras, University of Thessaly"}, "16048105300": {"Name": "Psaras I.", "AuthorID": "16048105300", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60030988", "AffiliationName": "University of Surrey, Democritus University of Thrace"}, "17435754200": {"Name": "Rene S.", "AuthorID": "17435754200", "AffiliationID": "109674129", "AffiliationName": "Network Engineering Department, Technical University"}}}
