We aimed to compare the risk of all-cause and liverrelated death (LRD) according to HCV treatment response in HIV/HCV patients in the multicohort study Collaboration ofObservationalHIV EpidemiologicalResearch inEurope. Methods: All patients who had started pegylated interferon+ribavirin (baseline) and followed for at least 72 weeks after baseline were included. Patients were categorized into three response groups depending on treatment duration and HCV-RNA measured in the window 24-72 weeks after baseline. Patients who received at least 24 weeks of therapy were defined as responders if their last HCV-RNA measured between 24 and 72 weeks after baseline was negative, and having 'unknown response' if HCV-RNA was unknown. Nonresponders were treated for less than 24 weeks or were HCV-RNA+ between 24 and 72 weeks after baseline. Mortality rates were compared using survival analysis, and Cox regression was used to compare hazard ratios of death between response groups. Results: A total of 3755 patients were included: 1031 (27.5%) responders, 1639 (43.6%) nonresponders and 1085 (28.9%) with unknown response. Rates [per 1000 person-years of follow-up, 95% confidence interval (CI)] of all-cause death were 17.59 (14.88-20.78), 10.43 (7.62-14.28) and11.00 (8.54-14.23) for nonresponders, responders and unknown responders, respectively. After adjustment, the relative hazard (nonresponders vs. responders) for all-cause death, LRD and nonliver-related death was 1.53 (95% CI 1.06-2.22), 3.39 (95% CI 1.32-8.75) and 1.22 (95% CI 0.80-1.84), respectively. Conclusion: HIV/HCV patients with a favourable virological response to pegylated interferon+ribavirin had reduced risk of all-cause and LRD, whereas therewas no difference in risk of nonliver-related death when comparing responders and nonresponders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hepatitis C", "hepatitis C virus", "HIV", "interferon", "mortality", "ribavirin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antiviral Agents", "Cohort Studies", "Coinfection", "Europe", "Female", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Interferon-alpha", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Prognosis", "Ribavirin", "RNA, Viral", "Survival Analysis", "Sustained Virologic Response", "Treatment Outcome", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007247540", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"15058026800": {"Name": "Peters L.", "AuthorID": "15058026800", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Section 2100, Rigshospitalet"}}}
