We have used a T-cell mediated mouse model of retinal autoimmune disease to unravel the role of Anx-A1 in the development of autoreactive Th cell responses and pathology. RBP<inf>1-20</inf>-immunized C57BL/6 Anx-A1<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit significantly enhanced retinal inflammation and pathology as a result of an uncontrolled proliferation and activation of Th17 cells. This is associated with a limited capacity to induce SOCS3, resulting in un-restricted phosphorylation of STAT3. RBP<inf>1-20</inf>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> cells from immunized Anx-A1<sup>-/-</sup> animals generated high levels of Th17 cells-associated cytokines. Following disease induction, daily systemic administration of human recombinant Anx-A1 (hrAnx-A1), during the afferent phase of disease, restrained autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> cell proliferation, reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 and attenuated autoimmune retinal inflammatory disease. Furthermore, in man, Anx-A1 serum levels when measured in active uveitis patient sera were low and associated with the detection of IgM and IgG anti-Anx-A1 antibodies when compared to healthy individuals. This data supports Anx-A1 as an early and critical regulator of Th17 cell driven autoimmune diseases such as uveitis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Annexin-A1", "Autoimmune", "SOCS3", "STAT3", "Th17", "Uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Annexin A1", "Autoimmune Diseases", "Cell Proliferation", "Cytokines", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Eye Proteins", "Humans", "Inflammation Mediators", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Peptide Fragments", "Recombinant Proteins", "Retinol-Binding Proteins", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins", "Th17 Cells", "Uveitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930384640", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"24448818000": {"Name": "Yazid S.", "AuthorID": "24448818000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36981692900": {"Name": "Gardner P.J.", "AuthorID": "36981692900", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "16021063000": {"Name": "Carvalho L.", "AuthorID": "16021063000", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55520733700": {"Name": "Chu C.J.", "AuthorID": "55520733700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "55712827400": {"Name": "Lee R.W.J.", "AuthorID": "55712827400", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Inst. of Ophthalmology"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Inst. of Ophthalmology"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Inst. of Ophthalmology"}, "7102232643": {"Name": "Flower R.J.", "AuthorID": "7102232643", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, QMUL"}, "7003777085": {"Name": "Solito E.", "AuthorID": "7003777085", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, QMUL"}}}
