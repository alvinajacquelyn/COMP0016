The peak bilirubin criterion (>7.0 mg/dL or \u2265120 \u03bcmol/L) is used to define PLF. This study aimed to validate the peak bilirubin criterion as postoperative risk indicator for 90-day liver-related mortality. Methods Characteristics of 956 consecutive patients who underwent partial hepatectomy at the Maastricht University Medical Centre or Royal Free London between 2005 and 2012 were analyzed by uni- and multivariable analyses with odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Results Thirty-five patients (3.7%) met the postoperative peak bilirubin criterion at median day 19 with a median bilirubin level of 183 [121\u2013588] \u03bcmol/L. Sensitivity and specificity for liver-related mortality after major hepatectomy were 41.2% and 94.6%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 22.6%. Predictors of liver-related mortality were the peak bilirubin criterion (p < 0.001, OR = 15.9 [95%CI 5.2\u201348.7]), moderate-severe steatosis and fibrosis (p = 0.013, OR = 8.5 [95%CI 1.6\u201346.6]), ASA 3\u20134 (p = 0.047, OR = 3.0 [95%CI 1.0\u20138.8]) and age (p = 0.044, OR = 1.1 [95%CI 1.0\u20131.1]). Conclusion The peak bilirubin criterion has a low sensitivity and positive predictive value for 90-day liver-related mortality after major hepatectomy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Bilirubin", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Hepatectomy", "Humans", "Liver Failure", "Logistic Models", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Netherlands", "Odds Ratio", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Up-Regulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992736370", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"55908090800": {"Name": "van Mierlo K.M.C.", "AuthorID": "55908090800", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Maastricht University Medical Centre and NUTRIM School of Nutrition and Translational Research, Maastricht University"}, "55151131200": {"Name": "Lodewick T.M.", "AuthorID": "55151131200", "AffiliationID": "60001097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Hospital Aachen, Division of General, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery"}, "57191752373": {"Name": "van Woerden V.", "AuthorID": "57191752373", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Maastricht University Medical Centre and NUTRIM School of Nutrition and Translational Research, Maastricht University"}, "56167817300": {"Name": "Kurstjens R.", "AuthorID": "56167817300", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Maastricht University Medical Centre and NUTRIM School of Nutrition and Translational Research, Maastricht University"}, "6601972369": {"Name": "Schaap F.G.", "AuthorID": "6601972369", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Maastricht University Medical Centre and NUTRIM School of Nutrition and Translational Research, Maastricht University"}, "15519868800": {"Name": "van Dam R.M.", "AuthorID": "15519868800", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Maastricht University Medical Centre and NUTRIM School of Nutrition and Translational Research, Maastricht University"}, "35419258600": {"Name": "Dejong C.H.C.", "AuthorID": "35419258600", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University"}, "6603388208": {"Name": "Olde Damink S.W.M.", "AuthorID": "6603388208", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Free & Institute for Liver and Digestive Health University College London Hospitals, and University College London"}, "7006741316": {"Name": "Dhar D.K.", "AuthorID": "7006741316", "AffiliationID": "60016332", "AffiliationName": "Organ Transplantation Centre and Comparative Medicine Department, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre"}, "7101837877": {"Name": "Vyas S.", "AuthorID": "7101837877", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Free & Institute for Liver and Digestive Health University College London Hospitals, and University College London"}, "55946935500": {"Name": "Malag\u00f3 M.", "AuthorID": "55946935500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Free & Institute for Liver and Digestive Health University College London Hospitals, and University College London"}}}
