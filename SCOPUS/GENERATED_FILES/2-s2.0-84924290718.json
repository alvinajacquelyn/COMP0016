The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) flux is modulated by both particle drift patterns and solar wind structures on a range of timescales. Over solar cycles, GCR flux varies as a function of the total open solar magnetic flux and the latitudinal extent of the heliospheric current sheet. Over hours, drops of a few percent in near-Earth GCR flux (Forbush decreases, FDs) are well known to be associated with the near-Earth passage of solar wind structures resulting from corotating interaction regions (CIRs) and transient coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We report on four FDs seen at ground-based neutron monitors which cannot be immediately associated with significant structures in the local solar wind. Similarly, there are significant near-Earth structures which do not produce any corresponding GCR variation. Three of the FDs are during the STEREO era, enabling in situ and remote observations from three well-separated heliospheric locations. Extremely large CMEs passed the STEREO-A spacecraft, which was behind the West limb of the Sun, approximately 2-3 days before each near-Earth FD. Solar wind simulations suggest that the CMEs combined with pre-existing CIRs, enhancing the pre-existing barriers to GCR propagation. Thus these observations provide strong evidence for the modulation of GCR flux by remote solar wind structures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmic rays", "Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)", "Sun: heliosphere", "Sun: magnetic fields"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924290718", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55456163300": {"Name": "Thomas S.R.", "AuthorID": "55456163300", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Meteorology, University of Reading"}, "24295857400": {"Name": "Owens M.J.", "AuthorID": "24295857400", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Meteorology, University of Reading"}, "7101631674": {"Name": "Lockwood M.", "AuthorID": "7101631674", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Meteorology, University of Reading"}, "38361005900": {"Name": "Barnard L.", "AuthorID": "38361005900", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Meteorology, University of Reading"}, "8948593600": {"Name": "Scott C.J.", "AuthorID": "8948593600", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Meteorology, University of Reading"}}}
