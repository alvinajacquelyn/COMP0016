Methods: Six advanced Parkinson's disease patients had serial [11C]raclopride PET to assess levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusion-induced rises in striatal dopamine as reflected by a fall in dopamine-D2/3 receptor availability. Parkinson's disease patients had baseline scan OFF-dopaminergic stimulation and 2 scans following initiation of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusions. Striatal D2/3 binding was measured in striatal subregions corresponding to sensorimotor, limbic, and cognitive/associative function. Results: Mean striatal [11C]raclopride nondisplaceable binding potential decreased by 14.0% to 16.7% in sensorimotor, 12.0%-14.4% in limbic, and 8.7%-11.6% in cognitive/associative function subregions at 1- to 10-hour points (P < 0.01). Sensorimotor subregion [11C]raclopride nondisplaceable binding potential reductions correlated with reductions in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III scores over the course of the infusion (r = 0.81; P < 0.05). Conclusions: Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusions generate a stable rise in striatal dopamine levels and are associated with improvements in motor manifestations. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["duodopa", "levodopa", "Parkinson's", "PET", "raclopride"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Carbidopa", "Dopamine", "Dopamine Agonists", "Drug Combinations", "Female", "Gels", "Humans", "Infusions, Parenteral", "Levodopa", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neostriatum", "Parkinson Disease", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Receptors, Dopamine D2", "Receptors, Dopamine D3"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85003864908", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24767083800": {"Name": "Politis M.", "AuthorID": "24767083800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "36118093600": {"Name": "Loane C.", "AuthorID": "36118093600", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Memory Research Group, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "54894616700": {"Name": "Sauerbier A.", "AuthorID": "54894616700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "57207336847": {"Name": "Martin A.", "AuthorID": "57207336847", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson's Centre of Excellence, Department of Neurology, King's College Hospital Foundation Trust"}, "7102516281": {"Name": "Ray-Chaudhuri K.", "AuthorID": "7102516281", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}, "6701818479": {"Name": "Pavese N.", "AuthorID": "6701818479", "AffiliationID": "60029616, 60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}, "57202558741": {"Name": "Brooks D.J.", "AuthorID": "57202558741", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, Newcastle University"}, "7006264864": {"Name": "Piccini P.", "AuthorID": "7006264864", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neurodegeneration and Neuroinflammation, Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7005563287": {"Name": "Corcoran B.", "AuthorID": "7005563287", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, King's College Hospital Foundation Trust"}}}
