Following establishment, genomic methylation patterns are transmitted through S-phase by the maintenance methyltransferase Dnmt1. Using a protein interaction screen, we identify Microprocessor component DROSHA as a novel DNMT1-interactor. Drosha-deficient embryonic stem (ES) cells display genomic hypomethylation that is not accounted for by changes in the levels of DNMT proteins. DNMT1- mediated methyltransferase activity is also reduced in these cells. We identify two transcripts that are specifically upregulated in Drosha- but not Dicerdeficient ES cells. Regions within these transcripts predicted to form stem-loop structures are processed by Microprocessor and can inhibit DNMT1- mediated methylation in vitro. Our results highlight DROSHA as a novel regulator of mammalian DNA methylation and we propose that DROSHA-mediated processing of RNA is necessary to ensure full DNMT1 activity. This adds to the DROSHA repertoire of nonmiRNA dependent functions as well as implicating RNA in regulating DNMT1 activity and correct levels of genomic methylation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "CRISPR-Cas Systems", "Cytosine", "DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase", "DNA Methylation", "Embryonic Stem Cells", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Mice", "Ribonuclease III", "RNA, Messenger", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031927178", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"13807825800": {"Name": "Stathopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "13807825800", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "57057676900": {"Name": "Chhetri J.B.", "AuthorID": "57057676900", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "12239907600": {"Name": "Ooi S.K.T.", "AuthorID": "12239907600", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Biology, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "57189761734": {"Name": "Ambrose J.C.", "AuthorID": "57189761734", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bill Lyons Informatics Centre, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "23477304600": {"Name": "Herrero J.", "AuthorID": "23477304600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bill Lyons Informatics Centre, UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7003412682": {"Name": "Est\u00e8ve P.O.", "AuthorID": "7003412682", "AffiliationID": "60028507", "AffiliationName": "New England Biolabs"}, "57001553000": {"Name": "Zhang G.", "AuthorID": "57001553000", "AffiliationID": "60028507", "AffiliationName": "New England Biolabs"}, "55807118300": {"Name": "Pradhan S.", "AuthorID": "55807118300", "AffiliationID": "60028507", "AffiliationName": "New England Biolabs"}, "56323529200": {"Name": "Ji L.", "AuthorID": "56323529200", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Bioinformatics, University of Georgia"}, "11839657900": {"Name": "Schmitz R.J.", "AuthorID": "11839657900", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, University of Georgia"}, "56260438600": {"Name": "Erdjument-Bromage H.", "AuthorID": "56260438600", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Skirball Institute, NYU School of Medicine"}, "7006293991": {"Name": "Neubert T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006293991", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Skirball Institute, NYU School of Medicine"}}}
