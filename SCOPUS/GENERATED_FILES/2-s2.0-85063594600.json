{"Title": "The prevalence of hand and wrist osteoarthritis in elite former cricket and rugby union players", "Year": 2019, "Source": "J. Sci. Med.

Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Data from cross-sectional studies of former elite male cricket and rugby players were used to determine the prevalence of hand pain, physician-diagnosed osteoarthritis, and previous severe injury. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association of previous injury with pain and osteoarthritis. Results: Data from 200 cricketers and 229 rugby players were available. Complete case analysis resulted in 127 cricketers and 140 rugby players. Hand pain was more prevalent amongst cricketers (19.7%) than rugby players (10.0%). The prevalence did not differ between cricket and rugby players for hand osteoarthritis (2.4% and 3.6%), wrist osteoarthritis (1.6% and 2.1%), or previous severe hand injury (36.2% and 31.4%). No significant association between previous hand injury and pain or osteoarthritis was identified in either sport. Conclusions: Former elite cricketers reported more hand pain than rugby players. No significant association was found between self-reported severe injury and hand osteoarthritis in either cohort, potentially indicating that risk factors aside from injury may be more prominent in the development of hand osteoarthritis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Athlete", "Epidemiology", "Injury", "Prevalence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Athletes", "Athletic Injuries", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "Football", "Hand", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nutrition Surveys", "Osteoarthritis", "Pain Measurement", "Prevalence", "Wrist Joint"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063594600", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"57195233070": {"Name": "Jones M.E.", "AuthorID": "57195233070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57195803562": {"Name": "Davies M.A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195803562", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, University of Bath"}, "57190278210": {"Name": "Shah K.", "AuthorID": "57190278210", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Botnar Research Centre"}, "55274497400": {"Name": "Leyland K.M.", "AuthorID": "55274497400", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Medical School, Population Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "36940269500": {"Name": "Judge A.D.", "AuthorID": "36940269500", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Medical School, Translational Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "55722205000": {"Name": "Newton J.L.", "AuthorID": "55722205000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Botnar Research Centre"}, "57200910420": {"Name": "Furniss D.", "AuthorID": "57200910420", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Botnar Research Centre"}, "7006658328": {"Name": "Arden N.K.", "AuthorID": "7006658328", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology, and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford, Botnar Research Centre"}, "57210812625": {"Name": "Kemp S.", "AuthorID": "57210812625", "AffiliationID": "60110688", "AffiliationName": "Rugby Football Union"}, "7102105409": {"Name": "Stokes K.A.", "AuthorID": "7102105409", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, University of Bath"}, "6602119748": {"Name": "Peirce N.", "AuthorID": "6602119748", "AffiliationID": "60111023", "AffiliationName": "England and Wales Cricket Board, National Cricket Performance Centre"}}}
