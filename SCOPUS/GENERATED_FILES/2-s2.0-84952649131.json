Materials & methods: Human melanoma cells were loaded with citric acid-coated iron-oxide nanoparticles, and subjected to a time-varying magnetic field. Pathways were monitored in vitro in suspensions and in situ in monolayers using fluorophores to report on early-stage apoptosis and late-stage apoptosis and/or necrosis. Results: Delayed-onset effects were observed, with a rate and extent proportional to the thermal-load-per-cell. At moderate loads, membranal internal-to-external lipid exchange preceded rupture and death by a few hours (the timeline varying cell-to-cell), without any measurable change in the local environment temperature. Conclusion: Our observations support the proposition that intracellular heating may be a viable, controllable and nonaggressive in vivo treatment for human pathological conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["apoptosis", "cell death pathways", "human melanoma cells", "magnetic hyperthermia", "magnetic nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Computer Systems", "Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation", "Humans", "Hyperthermia, Induced", "Magnetic Fields", "Magnetite Nanoparticles", "Melanoma", "Radiation Dosage", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952649131", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"35758304700": {"Name": "Blanco-Andujar C.", "AuthorID": "35758304700", "AffiliationID": "60103368, 60027156", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique et Chimie des Mat\u00e9riaux de Strasbourg (IPCMS), UMR-7504 CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg"}, "16310916900": {"Name": "Ortega D.", "AuthorID": "16310916900", "AffiliationID": "60018678, 60006754, 60106540", "AffiliationName": "Nanobiotecnolog\u00eda (IMDEA-Nanociencia), Unidad Asociada Al Centro Nacional de Biotecnolog\u00eda (CSIC)"}, "26432363000": {"Name": "Southern P.", "AuthorID": "26432363000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}, "36860339800": {"Name": "Nesbitt S.", "AuthorID": "36860339800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}, "7005152034": {"Name": "Thanh N.", "AuthorID": "7005152034", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biophysics Group, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006435054": {"Name": "Pankhurst Q.", "AuthorID": "7006435054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Biomagnetics Laboratory, University College London"}}}
