Cardiovascular biomarkers have been suggested to relate to CAD severity, but data on sex-specificity is scarce. Therefore, we investigated the association of established biomarkers with the severity of CAD in stable patients undergoing coronary angiography in a sex-specific manner. Methods: We studied stable patients undergoing coronary angiography and measured CAD severity by SYNTAX score and biomarker levels (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT pro-BNP), high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), cystatin C (CysC), myeloperoxidase (MPO), high-sensitivity troponin I (hsTnI) and von Willebrand factor (VWF)). We tested for sex differences in SYNergy between percutaneous coronary intervention with TAXUS\u2122 and cardiac surgery (SYNTAX) scores and biomarker levels using multivariable ANCOVA. We investigated the association of biomarker levels with SYNTAX score in a multivariable linear regression with interaction terms for sex. Results: We analysed data on 460 men and 175 women. SYNTAX scores were significantly lower in women (9.99 points vs. 11.88 points). Univariably, hsCRP and hsTnI levels were significantly associated with SYNTAX scores (both \u03b2 2.5). In multivariable analysis only hsCRP associated with SYNTAX score (\u03b2 1.9, p = 0.009). Sex did not modify the association of biomarkers with SYNTAX score. Conclusion: CAD severity as quantified by SYNTAX score is lower in women than men based on coronary angiography. The association of biomarkers with CAD severity did not differ between the sexes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Coronary angiography", "Epidemiology", "Sex"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biological Specimen Banks", "Biomarkers", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Coronary Angiography", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Netherlands", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955375999", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55879300600": {"Name": "Gijsberts C.", "AuthorID": "55879300600", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "ICIN-Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "56505118400": {"Name": "Gohar A.", "AuthorID": "56505118400", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "56505410700": {"Name": "Ellenbroek G.", "AuthorID": "56505410700", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "6602179811": {"Name": "Hoefer I.", "AuthorID": "6602179811", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7003654548": {"Name": "de Kleijn D.", "AuthorID": "7003654548", "AffiliationID": "60106366", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, National University Heart Centre, National University Health System"}, "7004573949": {"Name": "Pasterkamp G.", "AuthorID": "7004573949", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "14071039800": {"Name": "den Ruijter H.", "AuthorID": "14071039800", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "7006736234": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "7006736234", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "6603205958": {"Name": "Nathoe H.", "AuthorID": "6603205958", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "11839221100": {"Name": "Agostoni P.", "AuthorID": "11839221100", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "8253497700": {"Name": "Rittersma S.", "AuthorID": "8253497700", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Division Heart and Lungs, University Medical Centre Utrecht"}, "6602244673": {"Name": "Appelman Y.", "AuthorID": "6602244673", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, VU University Medical Center"}}}
