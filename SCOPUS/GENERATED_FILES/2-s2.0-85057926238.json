This editorial aims at drawing the attention of the reader to the current establishment of quantitative imaging biomarkers, in particular through the efforts of the Quantitative Imaging Biomarker Alliance (QIBA) from the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), as well as the European Imaging Biomarker Alliance (EIBALL) from the European Society of Radiology (ESR). The case of arterial spin labelling (ASL) is used as an example of the long and winding road to translate a good imaging technique into a clinically relevant imaging biomarker.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Calibration", "Imaging", "Perfusion imaging", "Phantoms", "Quantitative evaluations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057926238", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
