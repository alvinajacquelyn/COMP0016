However, triple-site testing represents a cost pressure for services.MSMover 18 years of age were eligible if they requested testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), reported recent sexual contact with either C. trachomatis or N. gonorrhoeae, or had symptoms of an STI. Each patient underwent standard-of-care (SOC) triple-site testing, and swabs were taken to form a pooled sample (PS) (pharyngeal, rectal, and urine specimens). The PS was created using two methods during different periods at one clinic, but we analyzed the data in combination because the sensitivity of the two methods did not differ significantly for C. trachomatis (P0.774) or N. gonorrhoeae (P0.163). The sensitivity of PS testing (92%) was slightly lower than that of SOC testing (96%) for detecting C. trachomatis (P0.167). For N. gonorrhoeae, the sensitivity of PS testing (90%) was significantly lower than that of SOC testing (99%) (P< 0.001). When pharynx-only infections were excluded, the sensitivity of PS testing to detect N. gonorrhoeae infections increased to 94%. Our findings show that pooling of self-taken samples could be an effective and cost-saving method, with high negative predictive values.
