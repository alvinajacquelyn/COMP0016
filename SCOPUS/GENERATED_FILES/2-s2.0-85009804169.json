The AIRs of each individual channel have been evaluated for DP-64QAM, DP-256QAM, and DP-1024QAM modulation formats. The impact of fullfield nonlinear compensation (FF-NLC) and probabilistically shaped constellations using a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution were studied and compared to electronic dispersion compensation. It has been found that a probabilistically shaped DP-1024QAM constellation, combined with FF-NLC, yields achievable information rates of \u223c75 Tbit?s for the EDFA scheme and \u223c223 Tbit?s for the Raman amplification scheme over a 2000 km standard single-mode fiber transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable information rate", "Distributed Raman amplification", "Electronic dispersion compensation", "Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution", "Non-linear compensations", "Non-linearity compensation", "Perturbation Analysis", "Standard single mode fibers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009804169", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57192990604": {"Name": "Semrau D.", "AuthorID": "57192990604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7401627190": {"Name": "Xu T.", "AuthorID": "7401627190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57090027300": {"Name": "Shevchenko N.", "AuthorID": "57090027300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "55811675800": {"Name": "Paskov M.", "AuthorID": "55811675800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "23476771600": {"Name": "Alvarado A.", "AuthorID": "23476771600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
