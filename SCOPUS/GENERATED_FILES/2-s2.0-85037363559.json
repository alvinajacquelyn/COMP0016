Specimens were printed using different paste-like suspensions made from ground beech sawdust and methylcellulose dissolved in water. The wood content could be increased up to 89% in dry mass. Physical properties were influenced by binder/water ratio and wood particle size. Shrinkage due to drying was 17.3\u201320.0%. Density values (r12) lay between 0.33 and 0.48 g/cm3. Bending strength and modulus of elasticity ranged from 2.3 to 7.4 and from 284.8 to 733.1 N/mm2, respectively. Density, MOR and MOE increased with increasing viscosity of dissolved methylcellulose and decreased with increasing particle size.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Density value", "Increasing viscosity", "Liquid deposition", "Methylcellulose", "Paste-like", "Wood content", "Wood particles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037363559", "SubjectAreas": [["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"36136061700": {"Name": "Rosenthal M.", "AuthorID": "36136061700", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "57198886666": {"Name": "Henneberger C.", "AuthorID": "57198886666", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "57198889454": {"Name": "Gutkes A.", "AuthorID": "57198889454", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "6602364693": {"Name": "Bues C.", "AuthorID": "6602364693", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}}}
