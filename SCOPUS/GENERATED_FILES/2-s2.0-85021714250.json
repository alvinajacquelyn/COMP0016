Emerging evidence suggests that co-polymerization can alter the rate and/or mechanism of aggregation and can contribute to pathogenicity. Electrospray ionization-ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (ESI-IMS-MS) is uniquely suited to the study of these heterogeneous ensembles. Here, ESI-IMS-MS combined with analysis of fibrillation rates using thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence, is used to track the course of aggregation of variants of islet-amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in isolation and in pairwise mixtures. We identify a sub-population of extended monomers as the key precursors of amyloid assembly, and reveal that the fastest aggregating sequence in peptide mixtures determines the lag time of fibrillation, despite being unable to cross-seed polymerization. The results demonstrate that co-polymerization of IAPP sequences radically alters the rate of amyloid assembly by altering the conformational properties of the mixed oligomers that form.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Conformational properties", "Direct observations", "Heterogeneous ensembles", "Ion mobility spectrometry", "Islet amyloid polypeptides", "Post-translational modifications", "Protein sequences", "Seed Polymerization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021714250", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56496112600": {"Name": "Young L.", "AuthorID": "56496112600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "7003435130": {"Name": "Ashcroft A.", "AuthorID": "7003435130", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "7005041518": {"Name": "Radford S.", "AuthorID": "7005041518", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds"}, "54904840000": {"Name": "Tu L.", "AuthorID": "54904840000", "AffiliationID": "60092852, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica"}, "7006500064": {"Name": "Raleigh D.", "AuthorID": "7006500064", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}}}
