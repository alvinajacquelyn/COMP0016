The processes regulating peripheral naive T-cell numbers and clonal diversity remain poorly understood. Conceptually, homeostatic mechanisms must fall into the broad categories of neutral (simple random birth\u2013death models), competition (regulation of cell numbers through quorum-sensing, perhaps via limiting shared resources), adaptation (involving cell-intrinsic changes in homeostatic fitness, defined as net growth rate over time), or selection (involving the loss or outgrowth of cell populations deriving from intercellular variation in fitness). There may also be stably maintained heterogeneity within the naive T-cell pool. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we confront very general models of these processes with an array of experimental data, both new and published. While reduced competition for homeostatic stimuli may impact cell survival or proliferation in neonates or under moderate to severe lymphopenia, we show that the only mechanism capable of explaining multiple, independent experimental studies of naive CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell homeostasis in mice from young adulthood into old age is one of adaptation, in which cells act independently and accrue a survival or proliferative advantage continuously with their post-thymic age. However, aged naive T cells may also be functionally impaired, and so the accumulation of older cells via \u2018conditioning through experience\u2019 may contribute to reduced immune responsiveness in the elderly.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Aged", "Aging", "Animals", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Communication", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Genetic Fitness", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Immunologic Memory", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Lymphocyte Count", "Lymphopenia", "Mice", "Models, Immunological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046460788", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55988417400": {"Name": "Rane S.", "AuthorID": "55988417400", "AffiliationID": "60001574, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, College of Medical Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "35742438800": {"Name": "Yates A.J.", "AuthorID": "35742438800", "AffiliationID": "60001574, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection, Immunity & Inflammation, College of Medical Veterinary & Life Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "18041591000": {"Name": "Hogan T.", "AuthorID": "18041591000", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7006500719": {"Name": "Seddon B.", "AuthorID": "7006500719", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, UCL, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
