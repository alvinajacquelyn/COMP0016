A polymerizable guest (1-benzyl-3-vinylimidazolium), serving as a non-covalent supramolecular cross-linker upon complexation with CB[8] in a 2:1 manner is polymerized with a trace amount of chemical cross-linker N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide and a hydrophilic monomer acrylamide, yielding an aqueous dual network. The CB[8] host-guest complexes form dynamic loops along the polymer chains between two covalent cross-linking sites. Uniaxial stretching studies were conducted to further investigate the nonlinear and viscoelastic behavior of the dual networks. The notch-insensitiveness is evidenced when a notched sample was stretched, the notch was dramatically blunted and remained stable during stretching until a critical strain of 7x. These aqueous dual networks are stretchable and tough, showing efficient energy dissipation, and can be fully self-recovered upon relaxation through the reformation of host-guest complexes at room temperature. Both dynamic supramolecular interactions and chemical cross-links have been readily combined within a single system, and such dual network fabrication represents a powerful and facile strategy for the construction of biomimetic supramolecular materials, holding great promise for myriad applications, including artificial muscles, cartilage replacement and tissue engineering, wearable electronic devices, and microactuators.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomimetics", "cucurbit[n]uril host-guest interaction", "self-recovery", "supramolecular dual networks", "toughness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cartilage replacements", "Host guest interactions", "N ,N'-methylenebisacrylamide", "Self recovery", "Supramolecular interactions", "Supramolecular materials", "Supramolecular polymers", "Visco-elastic behaviors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009829107", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56768708300": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "56768708300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56547841100": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "56547841100", "AffiliationID": "60004351", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Applied Sciences, Universiti Teknologi MARA"}, "55329748300": {"Name": "Lan Y.", "AuthorID": "55329748300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6507768052": {"Name": "Scherman O.", "AuthorID": "6507768052", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56196038800": {"Name": "Yu Z.", "AuthorID": "56196038800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7007074873": {"Name": "Abell C.", "AuthorID": "7007074873", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
