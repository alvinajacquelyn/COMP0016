Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.During embryonic development, the paraxial mesoderm becomes segmented into somites, within which proliferative muscle progenitors and muscle fibers establish the skeletal musculature. Here, we demonstrate that a gene network previously implicated in somite boundary formation, involving the transcriptional regulators Tbx6, Mesp-b and Ripply1, also confers spatial and temporal regulation to skeletal myogenesis in zebrafish. We show that Tbx6 directly regulates mesp-b and ripply1 expression in vivo, and that the interactions within the regulatory network are largely conserved among vertebrates. Mesp-b is necessary and sufficient for the specification of a subpopulation of muscle progenitors, the central proportion of the Pax3+/Pax7+ dermomyotome. Conditional ubiquitous expression indicates that Mesp-b acts by inhibiting myogenic differentiation and by inducing the dermomyotome marker meox1. By contrast, Ripply1 induces a negative-feedback loop by promoting Tbx6 protein degradation. Persistent Tbx6 expression in Ripply1 knockdown embryos correlates with a deficit in dermomyotome and myotome marker gene expression, suggesting that Ripply1 promotes myogenesis by terminating Tbx6-dependent inhibition of myogenic maturation. Together, our data suggest that Mesp-b is an intrinsic upstream regulator of skeletal muscle progenitors and that, in zebrafish, the genes regulating somite boundary formation also regulate the development of the dermomyotome in the anterior somite compartment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dermomyotome", "Determination front", "Gene regulatory network", "Heat shock", "Maturation", "Myotome", "Protein degradation", "Segmentation", "Wavefront", "Zebrafish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Base Sequence", "Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors", "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Immunohistochemistry", "In Situ Hybridization", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Morpholinos", "Muscle Development", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Nuclear Proteins", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Somites", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930531867", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"41762943900": {"Name": "Windner S.E.", "AuthorID": "41762943900", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Wesleyan University"}, "37030885300": {"Name": "Doris R.A.", "AuthorID": "37030885300", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Wesleyan University"}, "57203576437": {"Name": "Ferguson C.M.", "AuthorID": "57203576437", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Wesleyan University"}, "6701518078": {"Name": "Devoto S.H.", "AuthorID": "6701518078", "AffiliationID": "60029788", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Wesleyan University"}, "57000710400": {"Name": "Nelson A.C.", "AuthorID": "57000710400", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King\u2019s College London, Guy\u2019s Campus"}, "55843147300": {"Name": "Tan H.", "AuthorID": "55843147300", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King\u2019s College London, Guy\u2019s Campus"}, "6701621437": {"Name": "Wardle F.C.", "AuthorID": "6701621437", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Randall Division of Cell and Molecular Biophysics, King\u2019s College London, Guy\u2019s Campus"}, "36786783700": {"Name": "Valentin G.", "AuthorID": "36786783700", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "MRC National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill"}, "7006526288": {"Name": "Oates A.C.", "AuthorID": "7006526288", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "MRC National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill"}}}
