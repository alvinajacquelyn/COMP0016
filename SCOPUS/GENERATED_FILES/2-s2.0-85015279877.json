Both the effects of gravity and surface tension are included in the dynamic boundary condition. An asymptotic analysis (based on the assumptions of small depth and small free surface displacements) is presented. It is shown that the problem can be modelled by a Benjamin\u2013Ono Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvili equation. Furthermore a fifth order Benjamin\u2013Ono Kadomtsev\u2013Petviashvili equation is derived to describe the flows in the particular case of values of the Bond number close to 1/3.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrohydrodynamics", "Weakly nonlinear waves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bond numbers", "Dynamic boundary conditions", "Free surfaces", "Free-surface flow", "Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation", "Nonlinear potential", "Vertical electric fields", "Weakly non-linear"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015279877", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191591738": {"Name": "Hunt M.", "AuthorID": "57191591738", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Bath"}, "7005594518": {"Name": "Vanden-Broeck J.", "AuthorID": "7005594518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7006057335": {"Name": "Papageorgiou D.", "AuthorID": "7006057335", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Imperial College"}, "6603182754": {"Name": "Parau E.", "AuthorID": "6603182754", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of East Anglia"}}}
