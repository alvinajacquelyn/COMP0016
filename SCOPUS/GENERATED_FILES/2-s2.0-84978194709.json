For this purpose, we define the class of chain mixed graphs (CMGs) with three types of edges and, for this class, provide a separation criterion under which the class of CMGs is stable under marginalization and conditioning and contains the class of LWF CGs as its subclass. We provide a method for generating such graphs after marginalization and conditioning for a given CMG or a given LWF CG.We then define and study the class of anterial graphs, which is also stable under marginalization and conditioning and contains LWF CGs, but has a simpler structure than CMGs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C-separation criterion", "Chain graph", "Independence model", "LWF Markov property", "M-separation", "Marginalization and conditioning", "Mixed graph"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978194709", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"55195221000": {"Name": "Sadeghi K.", "AuthorID": "55195221000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Laboratory, Centre for Mathematical Studies"}}}
