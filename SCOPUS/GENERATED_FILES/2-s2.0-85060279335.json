Fusion algorithms that extend covariance intersection and consensus-based approaches are such examples. In this paper, we analyze the variational principle underlying EMDs and show that the EMDs of finite-set distributions do not necessarily lead to consistent fusion of cardinality distributions. Indeed, we demonstrate that these inconsistencies may occur with overwhelming probability in practice, through examples with Bernoulli, Poisson, and independent identically distributed cluster processes. We prove that pointwise consistency of EMDs does not imply consistency in global cardinality and vice versa. Then, we redefine the variational problems underlying fusion and provide iterative solutions thereby establishing a framework that guarantees cardinality consistent fusion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Covariance intersection (CI)", "exponential mixture density (EMD)", "multisensor fusion", "random finite sets (RFS)", "target tracking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Covariance intersection", "Exponential mixtures", "Licenses", "Multi-sensor fusion", "Random finite sets", "Signal processing algorithms", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060279335", "SubjectAreas": [["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"24478194100": {"Name": "Uney M.", "AuthorID": "24478194100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Digital Communications, School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh"}, "37013348000": {"Name": "Houssineau J.", "AuthorID": "37013348000", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics and Applied Probability, National University of Singapore"}, "49060984700": {"Name": "Delande E.", "AuthorID": "49060984700", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences, University of Texas at Austin"}, "7003972937": {"Name": "Julier S.", "AuthorID": "7003972937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55449396000": {"Name": "Clark D.", "AuthorID": "55449396000", "AffiliationID": "60115803", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partment CITI, Telecom-SudParis"}}}
