This raises questions about what role consciousness actually plays in cognition. Here, we explored whether participants can learn cue-target contingencies in an attentional learning task when the cues were presented below the level of conscious awareness and how this differs from learning about conscious cues. Participants\u2019 manual (Experiment 1) and saccadic (Experiment 2) response speeds were influenced by both conscious and unconscious cues. However, participants were only able to adapt to reversals of the cue-target contingencies (Experiment 1) or changes in the reliability of the cues (Experiment 2) when consciously aware of the cues. Therefore, although visual cues can be processed unconsciously, learning about cues over a few trials requires conscious awareness of them. Finally, we discuss implications for cognitive theories of consciousness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attention", "Consciousness", "Learning", "Masked priming"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Attention", "Awareness", "Consciousness", "Cues", "Female", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Photic Stimulation", "Reaction Time", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054897798", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57117836600": {"Name": "Travers E.", "AuthorID": "57117836600", "AffiliationID": "60105355", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Philosophy, School of Advanced Study, University of London"}, "36051252900": {"Name": "Frith C.D.", "AuthorID": "36051252900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for NeuroImaging, University College London"}, "16310503600": {"Name": "Shea N.", "AuthorID": "16310503600", "AffiliationID": "60105355", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Philosophy, School of Advanced Study, University of London"}}}
