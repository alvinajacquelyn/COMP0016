All rights reserved.With the development of multimedia and Internet of things technologies, technology enhanced learning applications such as smart class and smart learning at home have received more attentions from industrial and academic communities. However, pervasive wireless communications, which builds new collaborative and personalized learning patterns, have an important impact on learning and teaching. For current pervasive wireless networks, spectrum resources become increasing lack due to the introduction of a large number of new wireless technologies and thus the access of many new devices to wireless networks for all kinds of applications such as online smart learning. How to exploit effectively spectrum resources in current pervasive wireless networks is a larger challenge. To this end, we study dynamic access problem for spectrum resources. In this paper, we analyze more complex multiple channel model with multiple primary and secondary users. We exploit the lognormal distribution to characterize primary user behaviors and use opportunistic spectrum access to obtain the sensing status of channels. To raise the channel utility, we control transmission radiuses of secondary users to make primary and secondary users simultaneously utilize the channel. Finally, we propose the dynamic access algorithm to multiple channels. Simulation results show that our approach is feasible and promising.", "AuthorKeywords": ["channel allocation", "Cognitive networks", "dynamic access", "multi-hop wireless communications", "technology enhanced learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Channel allocation", "Cognitive network", "Internet of things technologies", "Log-normal distribution", "Opportunistic spectrum access", "Technology enhanced learning", "Wireless communications", "Wireless multimedia communications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992146873", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"23388835100": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "23388835100", "AffiliationID": "60031863", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University"}, "55489226200": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "55489226200", "AffiliationID": "60031863", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "SIAT, Chinese Academy of Science"}, "57188876544": {"Name": "Miao L.", "AuthorID": "57188876544", "AffiliationID": "60018466", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering Technology, Middle Tennessee State University"}, "35079735800": {"Name": "Zhu T.", "AuthorID": "35079735800", "AffiliationID": "60024997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, UMBC"}, "24474714700": {"Name": "Ge X.", "AuthorID": "24474714700", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Minnesota"}}}
