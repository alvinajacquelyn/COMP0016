Due to their ability to suppress effector cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been proposed as a cellular therapy to prevent GvHD, however they also inhibit the functions of natural killer (NK) cells, key effectors of the Graft versus Leukemia effect. In this study, we have explored whether a Tregs therapy will also impact on NK cell differentiation. Using an in vitro model of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation into NK cells, we found that activated Tregs led to a 90% reduction in NK cell numbers when added at the time of commitment to the NK cell lineage. This effect was contact dependent and was reversible upon Tregs depletion. The few NK cells that developed in these cultures were mature and exhibited normal functions. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of activated Tregs in rag-/- \u03b3c-/- mice abrogated HSC differentiation into NK cells thus confirming our in vitro findings. Collectively, these results demonstrate for the first time that activated Tregs can inhibit NK cell differentiation from HSC under specific conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adoptive Transfer", "Animals", "Cell Proliferation", "Hematopoiesis", "Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Mice", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959378596", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"52364651000": {"Name": "Pedroza-Pacheco I.", "AuthorID": "52364651000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57221018031": {"Name": "Shah D.", "AuthorID": "57221018031", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "56076285300": {"Name": "Domogala A.", "AuthorID": "56076285300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "36104972200": {"Name": "Luevano M.", "AuthorID": "36104972200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57198161878": {"Name": "Jackson N.", "AuthorID": "57198161878", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "6603778666": {"Name": "Madrigal A.", "AuthorID": "6603778666", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7004019930": {"Name": "Saudemont A.", "AuthorID": "7004019930", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020641", "AffiliationName": "Anthony Nolan Research Institute, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7004126464": {"Name": "Blundell M.", "AuthorID": "7004126464", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health"}}}
