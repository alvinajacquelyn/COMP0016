Here, we explore the processes shaping the cancer genome, placing these within the context of tumor evolution and their impact on intratumor heterogeneity and drug development. We review evidence for constraints and contingencies to tumor evolution and highlight the clinical implications of diversity within tumors. We outline the limitations of genome-driven targeted therapies and explore future strategies, including immune and adaptive approaches, to address this therapeutic challenge.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964240053", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"54956605300": {"Name": "McGranahan N.", "AuthorID": "54956605300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Science and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "7005912775": {"Name": "Swanton C.", "AuthorID": "7005912775", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
