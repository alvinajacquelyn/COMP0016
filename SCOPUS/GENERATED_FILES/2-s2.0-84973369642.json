However, analysis of such spectra is complicated by the existence of alternative partial hydration states of some substances that can significantly alter their infrared signatures. This is illustrated here with urea, which is a dominant component of urine. The effects of hydration state on its infrared spectrum were investigated both by incubation in atmospheres of fixed relative humidities and by recording serial spectra during the drying process. Significant changes of absorption band positions and shapes were observed. Decomposition of the CN antisymmetric stretching (\u03bdas) band in all states was possible with four components whose relative intensities varied with hydration state. These correspond to the solution (1468 cm-1) and dry (1464 cm-1) states and two intermediate (1454 cm-1 and 1443 cm-1) forms that arise from specific urea-water and/or urea-urea interactions. Such intermediate forms of other compounds can also be formed, as demonstrated here with creatinine. Recognition of these states and their accommodation in analyses of materials such as dried urine allows more precise decomposition of spectra so that weaker bands of diagnostic interest can be more accurately defined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATR FT-IR", "Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy", "Creatinine", "Hydration", "Medical diagnostics", "Mid-infrared spectroscopy", "Mid-IR", "Urea"], "IndexKeywords": ["ATR FTIR", "Attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy", "Creatinine", "Medical diagnostics", "Mid-infrared spectroscopy", "Creatinine", "Desiccation", "Humans", "Humidity", "Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared", "Urea", "Urinalysis", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973369642", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"57203256331": {"Name": "Oliver K.V.", "AuthorID": "57203256331", "AffiliationID": "60019568, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Glynn Laboratory of Bioenergetics, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57197458979": {"Name": "Mar\u00e9chal A.", "AuthorID": "57197458979", "AffiliationID": "60019568, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Glynn Laboratory of Bioenergetics, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "7102577604": {"Name": "Rich P.R.", "AuthorID": "7102577604", "AffiliationID": "60019568, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Glynn Laboratory of Bioenergetics, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
