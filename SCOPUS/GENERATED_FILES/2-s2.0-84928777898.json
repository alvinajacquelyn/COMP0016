The range of flow values measured is accommodated by modifying the difference between the frequencies of signals driving two frequency shifters, each being a part of an active loop placed in each arm of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Motion estimation and optical flow", "Multiple Imaging", "Optical Coherence Tomography", "Semiconductor optical amplifiers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coherence lengths", "Frequency shifters", "Intralipids", "Low coherence interferometers", "Multiple imaging", "Multiple-path", "Simultaneous measurement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928777898", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"6603132505": {"Name": "Cernat R.", "AuthorID": "6603132505", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}, "12808804200": {"Name": "Bradu A.", "AuthorID": "12808804200", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}, "26638425000": {"Name": "Podoleanu A.G.", "AuthorID": "26638425000", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Applied Optics Group, School of Physical Sciences, University of Kent"}, "8417872600": {"Name": "Rajendram R.", "AuthorID": "8417872600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
