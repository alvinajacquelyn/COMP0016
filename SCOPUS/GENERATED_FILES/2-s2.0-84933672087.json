Doctors use a number of methods to assess RR, including formal measurement, and \u2018spot\u2019 assessments, although this is not recommended. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of the methods of RR measurement being used by doctors. A cross-sectional study assessing the accuracy (range, bias, and imprecision) of doctors\u2019 \u2018spot\u2019 and \u2018formal\u2019 respiratory rate assessments, using videos of mock patients. 54 doctors in a London teaching hospital participated. Both methods showed high levels of inaccuracy, though formal methods were more accurate than \u2018spot\u2019 assessments. 52 and 19 % of doctors did not identify the respiratory rates shown as abnormal, using \u2018spot\u2019 and formal assessment methods respectively. We observed a trend towards decreasing accuracy of \u2018spot\u2019 assessments with increasing clinical experience (p = 0.0490). Current methods of RR assessment by doctors are inaccurate. This may be significantly delaying appropriate clinical care, or even misguiding treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Observations", "Respiratory rate", "Vital signs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Assessment", "Clinical assessment tools", "Clinical experience", "Cross-sectional study", "Observations", "Patient condition", "Respiratory rate", "Vital sign", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Hospitals, Teaching", "Humans", "London", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Observer Variation", "Patient Simulation", "Physicians", "Reproducibility of Results", "Respiratory Rate", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Video Recording"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933672087", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"57217400612": {"Name": "Philip K.E.J.", "AuthorID": "57217400612", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56375839700": {"Name": "Pack E.", "AuthorID": "56375839700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56376257000": {"Name": "Rollmann H.", "AuthorID": "56376257000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56376761400": {"Name": "Weil S.", "AuthorID": "56376761400", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56376542600": {"Name": "O\u2019Beirne J.", "AuthorID": "56376542600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35361474300": {"Name": "Cambiano V.", "AuthorID": "35361474300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
