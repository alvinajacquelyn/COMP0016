Decision Support Systems (DSSs) could have a critical role in assessing the seismic risk of electric power networks and in enabling asset managers to test the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies and investments on resilience. This paper exemplifies the potentialities of CIPCast, a DSS recently created in the framework of the EU-funded project CIPRNet, to perform such tasks. CIPCast enables to perform risk assessment for Critical Infrastructures (CI) when subjected to different natural hazards, including earthquakes. An ad-hoc customization of CIPCast for the seismic risk analysis and management of electric power networks is featured in this paper. The international literature describes effective and sound efforts towards the creation of software platforms and frameworks for the assessment of seismic risk of electric power networks. None of them, unfortunately, achieved the goal of creating a user-friendly and ready available DDS to be used by asset managers, local authorities and civil protection departments. Towards that and building on the international literature, the paper describes metrics and methods to be integrated within CIPCast for assessing the earthquake-induced physical and functional impacts of the electric power network at component and system level. The paper describes also how CIPCast can inform the service restoration process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Damage Scenario", "Decision Making Processes", "Decision Support System (DSS)", "Electric power system", "Resilience", "Seismic risk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Damage scenarios", "Decision making process", "Decision support system (dss)", "Resilience", "Seismic risk"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026773689", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"15080548100": {"Name": "Giovinazzi S.", "AuthorID": "15080548100", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Sapienza University of Rome"}, "25633168300": {"Name": "Pollino M.", "AuthorID": "25633168300", "AffiliationID": "60019637", "AffiliationName": "ENEA Laboratory for the Analysis and Protection of Critical Infrastructures (APIC)"}, "6507548379": {"Name": "Caiaffa E.", "AuthorID": "6507548379", "AffiliationID": "60019637", "AffiliationName": "ENEA Laboratory for the Analysis and Protection of Critical Infrastructures (APIC)"}, "57193677296": {"Name": "Pietro A.", "AuthorID": "57193677296", "AffiliationID": "60019637", "AffiliationName": "ENEA Laboratory for the Analysis and Protection of Critical Infrastructures (APIC)"}, "56747854200": {"Name": "La Porta L.", "AuthorID": "56747854200", "AffiliationID": "60019637", "AffiliationName": "ENEA Laboratory for the Analysis and Protection of Critical Infrastructures (APIC)"}, "7003373994": {"Name": "Rosato V.", "AuthorID": "7003373994", "AffiliationID": "60019637", "AffiliationName": "ENEA Laboratory for the Analysis and Protection of Critical Infrastructures (APIC)"}, "35108164000": {"Name": "Tofani A.", "AuthorID": "35108164000", "AffiliationID": "60019637", "AffiliationName": "ENEA Laboratory for the Analysis and Protection of Critical Infrastructures (APIC)"}, "56123309100": {"Name": "Kongar I.", "AuthorID": "56123309100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "Earthquake and People Interaction Centre (EPICentre), University College London"}, "7801656850": {"Name": "Rossetto T.", "AuthorID": "7801656850", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012808", "AffiliationName": "Earthquake and People Interaction Centre (EPICentre), University College London"}}}
