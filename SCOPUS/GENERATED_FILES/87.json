Agents belong to one of two groups and occupy cells of rectangular space. Agents react to the fraction of agents of their own group within the neighborhood around their cell. Agents stay put when this fraction is above a given tolerance threshold but seek a new location if the fraction is below the threshold. The model is well-known for its tipping point behavior: an initially random (integrated) pattern remains integrated when the tolerance threshold is below 1/3 but becomes segregated when the tolerance threshold is above 1/3. In this paper, we demonstrate that the variety of the Schelling model\u2019s steady patterns is richer than the segregation\u2013integration dichotomy and contains patterns that consist of segregated patches of each of the two groups, alongside areas where both groups are spatially integrated. We obtain such patterns by considering a general version of the model in which the mechanisms of the agents' interactions remain the same, but the tolerance threshold varies between the agents of both groups. We show that the model produces patterns of mixed integration and segregation when the tolerance threshold of an essential fraction of agents is either low, below 1/5, or high, above 2/3. The emerging mixed patterns are relatively insensitive to the model\u2019s other parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethnic segregation", "Heterogeneous agents", "Residential dynamics", "Schelling model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945966723", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7801398143": {"Name": "Hatna E.", "AuthorID": "7801398143", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University"}, "6701674537": {"Name": "Benenson I.", "AuthorID": "6701674537", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "Tel Aviv University"}}}
