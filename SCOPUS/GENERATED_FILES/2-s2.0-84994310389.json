A superstructure containing two generation and three storage alternatives is considered. Model equations are developed for the components of the energy system, leading to a nonlinear system of differential algebraic equations. Two objectives are considered: cost minimisation and reliability maximisation. The capital cost is calculated from the capacities of the generation and storage units. Reliability is the ability of a power system to deliver energy in the quantity and with the frequency required and is represented by the loss of power supply probability (LPSP), calculated by the evaluation of design performance for a set of scenarios. The model is solved with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to obtain a Pareto-optimal set of designs which trade-off between both objectives. The performance of a typical design under poor renewable input conditions is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Integrated energy systems", "Multi-objective optimization", "Reliability", "Variability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994310389", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56811433800": {"Name": "Amusat O.", "AuthorID": "56811433800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006429775": {"Name": "Fraga E.", "AuthorID": "7006429775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
