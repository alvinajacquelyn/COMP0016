Certain model inputs are surveyed and sample outputs of a modelled efficient, electrified, high renewable energy system with district heating and fuel synthesis are given. Over short time periods, DynEMo calculates demands and renewable supplies and the storage of heat, electricity and chemical energy, being used to examine the technical feasibility of proposed systems and contribute towards the design and control of dynamic, renewable systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["control", "demand", "energy systems", "supply", "Trade"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical energy", "demand", "Design and control", "Different time scale", "Energy services", "Energy systems", "Renewable energy systems", "supply"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991782481", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"12803419900": {"Name": "Barrett M.", "AuthorID": "12803419900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "26039534700": {"Name": "Spataru C.", "AuthorID": "26039534700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}}}
