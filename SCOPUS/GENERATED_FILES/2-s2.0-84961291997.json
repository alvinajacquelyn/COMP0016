Somatic loss-of-function mutations of TET2 are frequently observed in human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is a clonal malignancy characterized by dysplastic changes of developing blood cell progenitors, leading to ineffective hematopoiesis. We used genome-editing technology to disrupt the zebrafish Tet2 catalytic domain. tet2m/m (homozygous for the mutation) zebrafish exhibited normal embryonic and larval hematopoiesis but developed progressive clonal myelodysplasia as they aged, culminating in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) at 24 months of age, with dysplasia of myeloid progenitor cells and anemia with abnormal circulating erythrocytes. The resultant tet2m/m mutant zebrafish lines show decreased levels of 5hmC in hematopoietic cells of the kidney marrow but not in other cell types, most likely reflecting the ability of other Tet family members to provide this enzymatic activity in nonhematopoietic tissues but not in hematopoietic cells. tet2m/m zebrafish are viable and fertile, providing an ideal model to dissect altered pathways in hematopoietic cells and, for small-molecule screens in embryos, to identify compounds with specific activity against tet2 mutant cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Catalytic Domain", "Cell Differentiation", "CpG Islands", "Dioxygenases", "Disease Models, Animal", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Flow Cytometry", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genotype", "Hematopoiesis", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "In Situ Hybridization", "Kidney", "Mutation", "Myelodysplastic Syndromes", "Stem Cells", "Zebrafish", "Zebrafish Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961291997", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"14010235300": {"Name": "Gjini E.", "AuthorID": "14010235300", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School"}, "16646833400": {"Name": "Mansour M.R.", "AuthorID": "16646833400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57188063800": {"Name": "Moritz N.", "AuthorID": "57188063800", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School"}, "57187741100": {"Name": "Nguyen A.T.", "AuthorID": "57187741100", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School"}, "57188467800": {"Name": "Kesarsing M.", "AuthorID": "57188467800", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School"}, "57188109600": {"Name": "Gans E.", "AuthorID": "57188109600", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School"}, "7402691412": {"Name": "He S.", "AuthorID": "7402691412", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School"}, "57187285600": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "57187285600", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School"}, "7102132660": {"Name": "Look A.T.", "AuthorID": "7102132660", "AffiliationID": "60014334, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School"}, "16680409800": {"Name": "Sander J.D.", "AuthorID": "16680409800", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School"}, "55665179600": {"Name": "Joung J.K.", "AuthorID": "55665179600", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School"}, "7201494768": {"Name": "Ko M.", "AuthorID": "7201494768", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "Division of Signaling and Gene Expression, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology"}, "55628583648": {"Name": "Rao A.", "AuthorID": "55628583648", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "Division of Signaling and Gene Expression, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology"}, "15073336800": {"Name": "Kuang Y.Y.", "AuthorID": "15073336800", "AffiliationID": "60073613", "AffiliationName": "Heilongjiang River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences No. 232"}, "56500848400": {"Name": "Yang S.", "AuthorID": "56500848400", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Division ofHematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "57138976000": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "57138976000", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Division ofHematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "7102121068": {"Name": "Zon L.I.", "AuthorID": "7102121068", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60014334", "AffiliationName": "Division ofHematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Boston and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute"}, "35600877200": {"Name": "Rodig S.", "AuthorID": "35600877200", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}}
