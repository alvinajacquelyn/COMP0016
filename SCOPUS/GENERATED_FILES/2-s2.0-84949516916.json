We present the first complete high-resolution southern European diatom record capturing the penultimate glacialinterglacial transition, from Lake Ioannina (northwest Greece). It forms part of a suite of proxie selected to assess the character and phase relationships of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem response to rapid climate warming, and to resolve apparent conflicts in proxy evidence for regional paleohydrology. The diatom data suggest a complex penultimate deglaciation driven primarily by multiple oscillations in lake level, and provide firm evidence for the regional influence of abrupt changes in North Atlantic conditions. There is diachroneity in lake and terrestrial ecosystem response to warming atthe onset of the last interglacial, with an abrupt increase in lake level occurring ~2.7 k.y. prior to sustained forest expansion with peak precipitation. We identify the potentially important role of direct input of snow melt and glacial meltwater transfer to the subterranean karst system in response to warming, which would cause rising regional groundwater levels. This explanation, and the greater sensitivity of diatoms to subtle changes in temperature, reconciles the divergent lacustrine and terrestrial proxy evidence and highlights the sensitivity of lakes situated in mountainous karstic environments to past climate warming.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ecosystem response", "Glacial interglacial transition", "Glacial meltwater", "Last interglacial", "Phase relationships", "Regional groundwater", "Terrestrial ecosystems", "Terrestrial systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949516916", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"8690659700": {"Name": "Wilson G.", "AuthorID": "8690659700", "AffiliationID": "60102026", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and International Development, University of Chester"}, "55430297800": {"Name": "Reed J.", "AuthorID": "55430297800", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences, University of Hull"}, "6701798229": {"Name": "Frogley M.", "AuthorID": "6701798229", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Sussex"}, "24465198600": {"Name": "Hughes P.", "AuthorID": "24465198600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, School of Environment, Education and Development, University of Manchester"}, "6603907728": {"Name": "Tzedakis P.", "AuthorID": "6603907728", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
