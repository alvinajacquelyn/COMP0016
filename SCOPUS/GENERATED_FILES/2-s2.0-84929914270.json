We used murine models to investigate the role of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling in cardiac development and found that embryonic Cxcl12-null hearts lacked intra-ventricular coronary arteries (CAs) and exhibited absent or misplaced CA stems. We traced the origin of this phenotype to defects in the early stages of CA stem formation. CA stems derive from the peritruncal plexus, an encircling capillary network that invades the wall of the developing aorta. We showed that CXCL12 is present at high levels in the outflow tract, while peritruncal endothelial cells (ECs) express CXCR4. In the absence of CXCL12, ECs were abnormally localized and impaired in their ability to anastomose with the aortic lumen. We propose that CXCL12 is required for connection of peritruncal plexus ECs to the aortic endothelium and thus plays a vital role in CA formation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Aorta", "Cells, Cultured", "Chemokine CXCL12", "Coronary Vessels", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Female", "Heart", "In Situ Hybridization", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Organogenesis", "Receptors, CXCR4", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929914270", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"8836627200": {"Name": "Ivins S.", "AuthorID": "8836627200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56656083700": {"Name": "Chappell J.", "AuthorID": "56656083700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "23006893700": {"Name": "Vernay B.", "AuthorID": "23006893700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56656643600": {"Name": "Suntharalingham J.", "AuthorID": "56656643600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7006489319": {"Name": "Scambler P.", "AuthorID": "7006489319", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology of Birth Defects, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56373095900": {"Name": "Martineau A.", "AuthorID": "56373095900", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Division, MRC National Institute for Medical Research"}, "7004364635": {"Name": "Mohun T.", "AuthorID": "7004364635", "AffiliationID": "60023477", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology Division, MRC National Institute for Medical Research"}}}
