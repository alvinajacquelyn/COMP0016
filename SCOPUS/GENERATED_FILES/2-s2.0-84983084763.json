A 7 TeV LHC bunch is used as the proton driver to create a plasma wakefield which then accelerates electrons to 3 TeV, these then colliding with the other 7 TeV LHC proton beam. Although of very high energy, the collider has a modest projected integrated luminosity of 10\u2013100 pb- 1. For such a collider, with a centre-of-mass energy 30 times greater than HERA, parton momentum fractions, x, down to about 10 - 8are accessible for photon virtualities, Q2, of 1 GeV2. The energy dependence of hadronic cross sections at high energies, such as the total photon\u2013proton cross section, which has synergy with cosmic-ray physics, can be measured and QCD and the structure of matter better understood in a region where the effects are completely unknown. Searches at high Q2for physics beyond the Standard Model will be possible, in particular the significantly increased sensitivity to the production of leptoquarks. These and other physics highlights of a very high energy electron\u2013proton collider are outlined.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983084763", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"7102816738": {"Name": "Caldwell A.", "AuthorID": "7102816738", "AffiliationID": "60008743", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Physics"}, "35279041700": {"Name": "Wing M.", "AuthorID": "35279041700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, UCL"}}}
