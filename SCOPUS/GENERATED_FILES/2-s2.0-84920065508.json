Eighty-five (74%) of the children (5-15. years of age) underwent a comprehensive psychological assessment. Twenty-one percent of the children met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for ASD, and 61% of them had another DSM-IV-TR behavioral or motor disorder. The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) was completed by parents (n. =. 69) and by teachers (n. =. 67) of children with an IQ. >. 34. Only 9% of children on parent ratings and 15% of children on teacher ratings had no features of ASD. Parents reported significantly (p. <. .05) more features of ASD on the ASSQ compared with teachers. Factors significantly associated with responses on the ASSQ included respondent (parents reported more features), school placement (more features in specialized settings), and respondent by school placement interaction. Effective screening for ASD in children with epilepsy will need a consideration of the impact of informant and school placement on ratings. In conclusion, features of ASD were common in children with epilepsy regardless of cognitive ability. The ASSQ was a useful screening instrument in this population, and combining parent and teacher forms was optimal in terms of screening properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorder", "Epilepsy", "Parent", "Screening", "Teacher"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent", "Child", "Child", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Child Development Disorders, Pervasive", "Child, Preschool", "Child, Preschool", "Comorbidity", "Comorbidity", "Epilepsy", "Epilepsy", "Faculty", "Faculty", "Female", "Female", "Great Britain", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Humans", "Male", "Male", "Parents", "Parents", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920065508", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"26634364600": {"Name": "Reilly C.", "AuthorID": "26634364600", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg"}, "7402223872": {"Name": "Das K.B.", "AuthorID": "7402223872", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "6507002035": {"Name": "Burch V.", "AuthorID": "6507002035", "AffiliationID": "60112913", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Young Epilepsy"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.R.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "23968672700": {"Name": "Atkinson P.", "AuthorID": "23968672700", "AffiliationID": "60011982", "AffiliationName": "Child Development Centre, Crawley Hospital"}, "7101634220": {"Name": "Gillberg C.", "AuthorID": "7101634220", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "6603729064": {"Name": "Aylett S.E.", "AuthorID": "6603729064", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "16030504100": {"Name": "Chin R.F.M.", "AuthorID": "16030504100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, Edinburgh Neurosciences, The University of Edinburgh"}}}
