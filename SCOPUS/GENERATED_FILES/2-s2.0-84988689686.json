As a profession, we have drawn extensively on these figurative frameworks to explore issues surrounding the digital library, yet very little has been written to date which interrogates how these metaphors have developed over the years. Previous studies have explored library metaphors, using either textual analysis or ethnographic methods to investigate their usage. However, this is to our knowledge the first study to use bibliographic data, corpus analysis, qualitative sentiment weighting and close reading to study particular metaphors in detail. It draws on a corpus of over 450 articles to study the use of the metaphors of the Library of Alexandria and Babel, concluding that both have been extremely useful as framing metaphors for the digital library. However, their longstanding use has seen them become stretched as metaphors, meaning that the field\u2019s figurative framework now fails to represent the changing technologies which underpin contemporary digital libraries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alexandria", "Babel", "Digital libraries", "Metaphor", "Theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988689686", "SubjectAreas": [["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"57147346800": {"Name": "Gooding P.", "AuthorID": "57147346800", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Art, Media and American Studies, University of East Anglia, University Plain"}, "23568761100": {"Name": "Terras M.", "AuthorID": "23568761100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
