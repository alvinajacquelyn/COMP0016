But because the topography of VGCCs and their proximity to vesicles is unknown, a quantitative understanding of the determinants of vesicular release at nanometer scale is lacking. To investigate this, we combined freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling of Cav2.1 channels, local [Ca2+] imaging, and patch pipette perfusion of EGTA at the calyx of Held. Between postnatal day 7 and 21, VGCCs formed variable sized clusters and vesicular release became less sensitive to EGTA, whereas fixed Ca2+ buffer properties remained constant. Experimentally constrained reaction-diffusion simulations suggest that Ca2+ sensors for vesicular release are located at the perimeter of VGCC clusters (<30nm) and predict that VGCC number per cluster determines vesicular release probability without altering release time course. This \"perimeter release model\" provides a unifying framework accounting for developmental changes in both synaptic efficacy and time course.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Calcium Chelating Agents", "Egtazic Acid", "Exocytosis", "Mice", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Presynaptic Terminals", "Rats", "Synapses", "Synaptic Vesicles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920744764", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55726797700": {"Name": "Nakamura Y.", "AuthorID": "55726797700", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS UMR 3571"}, "7406459521": {"Name": "Takahashi T.", "AuthorID": "7406459521", "AffiliationID": "60103932", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Synaptic Function Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) Graduate University"}, "7004128268": {"Name": "DiGregorio D.A.", "AuthorID": "7004128268", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS UMR 3571"}, "56384916900": {"Name": "Harada H.", "AuthorID": "56384916900", "AffiliationID": "60103776", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"}, "6602889174": {"Name": "Kamasawa N.", "AuthorID": "6602889174", "AffiliationID": "60103813", "AffiliationName": "Electron Microscopy Facility, Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience"}, "7402642228": {"Name": "Matsui K.", "AuthorID": "7402642228", "AffiliationID": "60180317", "AffiliationName": "Division of Interdisciplinary Medical Science, Center for Neuroscience, United Centers for Advanced Research and Translational Medicine, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "7005278726": {"Name": "Shigemoto R.", "AuthorID": "7005278726", "AffiliationID": "60103776", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Science and Technology Austria"}, "7103209522": {"Name": "Rothman J.S.", "AuthorID": "7103209522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7201936933": {"Name": "Silver R.A.", "AuthorID": "7201936933", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
