Methods: Logistic regression was used to model general literacy proficiency as a predictor of self-rated poor health. Results: Data from 167,062 adults aged 25\u201365 years were analyzed. The mean overall prevalence of self-rated poor health was 24%. The odds ratio of self-rated poor health for those in the lowest level of general literacy proficiency compared to those in the highest level was 2.5 (95% CI 2.2\u20133.0) in the unadjusted model, and 1.9 (95% CI 1.6\u20132.2) in the adjusted model. This association was robust over time and across countries. General literacy proficiency attenuated 22% of the effect of self-education on self-rated poor health, in addition to a substantial independent effect of its own. Conclusions: Our study provides robust and generalizable evidence that general literacy proficiency is independently associated with self-rated poor health. These results offer a potential modifiable target for policy interventions to reduce educational inequities in health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Educational attainment", "Literacy", "OECD", "Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies", "Self-rated poor health", "Socioeconomic status"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Developed Countries", "Diagnostic Self Evaluation", "Female", "Humans", "Literacy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Socioeconomic Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030152935", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"56826027700": {"Name": "Kakarmath S.", "AuthorID": "56826027700", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard T.H.
