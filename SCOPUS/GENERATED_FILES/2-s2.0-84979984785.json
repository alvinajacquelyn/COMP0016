Focusing on three international cases, including the anti-street harassment site Hollaback!, the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported, and interviews with teenage Twitter activists, the paper asks: What experiences of harassment, misogyny and rape culture are girls and women responding to? How are girls and women using digital media technologies to document experiences of sexual violence, harassment, and sexism? And, why are girls and women choosing to mobilize digital media technologies in such a way? Employing an approach that includes ethnographic methods such as semi-structured interviews, content analysis, discursive textual analysis, and affect theories, we detail a range of ways that women and girls are using social media platforms to speak about, and thus make visible, experiences of rape culture. We argue that this digital mediation enables new connections previously unavailable to girls and women, allowing them to redraw the boundaries between themselves and others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["activism", "affect", "Feminism", "rape culture", "Twitter"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979984785", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"37067584500": {"Name": "Keller J.", "AuthorID": "37067584500", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communication, Media and Film, University of Calgary"}, "26327001900": {"Name": "Mendes K.", "AuthorID": "26327001900", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Media and Communication, University of Leicester"}, "18042366600": {"Name": "Ringrose J.", "AuthorID": "18042366600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
