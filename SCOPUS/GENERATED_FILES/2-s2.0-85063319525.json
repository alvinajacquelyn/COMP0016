Published by BMJ.Objectives Research on associations between childhood maltreatment and adult cardiometabolic disease risk is sparse. We aimed to investigate associations between different forms of child maltreatment and mid-Adult cardiometabolic markers and whether potential intermediaries could account for the associations observed. Setting 1958 British birth cohort. Participants Approximately 9000 cohort members with data on cardiometabolic markers. Outcomes Adult (45y) cardiometabolic markers (blood pressure, lipids and glycated haemoglobin [HbA 1c ]). Results Seventeen per cent of participants were identified as neglected; 6.1%, 1.6% and 10.0% were identified as experiencing physical, sexual and psychological abuse, respectively. Childhood neglect and physical abuse were associated with high body mass index (BMI) and large waist circumference when adjusting for early-life covariates. For neglect, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was 1.16 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.32) and 1.15 (1.02 to 1.30) for general and central obesity, respectively, and for physical abuse, the respective AOR was 1.36 (1.13 to 1.64) and 1.38 (1.16 to 1.65). Neglect was also associated with raised triglycerides by 3.9 (0.3 to 7.5)% and HbA 1c by 1.2 (0.4 to 2.0)%, and among females, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) by 0.05 (0.01 to 0.08)mmol/L after adjustment. For physical abuse, the AOR was 1.25 (1.00 to 1.56) for high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HbA 1c was raised by 2.5 (0.7 to 4.3)% (in males) and HDL-c was lower by 0.06 (0.01 to 0.12)mmol/L (in females). Associations for sexual abuse were similar to those for physical abuse but 95% CIs were wide. For psychological abuse, the AOR for elevated triglycerides was 1.21 (1.02 to 1.44) and HDL-c was lower by 0.04 (0.01 to 0.07)mmol/L. Maltreatments were not associated with raised blood pressure. In analyses of potential intermediary factors, several associations attenuated after adjustment for adult lifestyles (mainly smoking and alcohol consumption rather than physical activity) and child-To-Adult BMI. Conclusions Childhood maltreatments, particularly neglect and physical abuse, were associated with greater adiposity and poorer lipid and HbA 1c profiles decades later in adulthood. Associations were modest but independent of early-life factors linked to these outcomes. Findings implicate adult lifestyles as an important intermediary between child maltreatment and outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiometabolic biomarkers", "child abuse", "child maltreatment", "child neglect", "cohort study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adiposity", "Adolescent", "Biomarkers", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Child", "Child Abuse", "Female", "Glycated Hemoglobin A", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Lipids", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Metabolic Syndrome", "Middle Aged", "Obesity", "Odds Ratio", "Prospective Studies", "Public Health Surveillance", "United Kingdom", "Waist Circumference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063319525", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55605020600": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "55605020600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice Programme, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57202939364": {"Name": "Pinto Pereira S.M.", "AuthorID": "57202939364", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice Programme, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203229564": {"Name": "Power C.", "AuthorID": "57203229564", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice Programme, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
