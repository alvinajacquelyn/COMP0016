Learning paradigms are increasingly being extended to study mood and psychiatric disorders as well as addiction. However, one potentially critical characteristic that this research ignores is the effect of time on learning: human feedback learning paradigms are usually conducted in a single rapidly paced session, whereas learning experiences in ecologically relevant circumstances and in animal research are almost always separated by longer periods of time. In our experiments, we examined reward learning in short condensed sessions distributed across weeks versus learning completed in a single \u201cmassed\u201d session in male and female participants. As expected, we found that after equal amounts of training, accuracy was matched between the spaced and massed conditions. However, in a 3-week follow-up, we found that participants exhibited significantly greater memory for the value of spaced-trained stimuli. Supporting a role for short-term memory in massed learning, we found a significant positive correlation between initial learning and working memory capacity. Neurally, we found that patterns of activity in the medial temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex showed stronger discrimination of spaced-versus massed-trained reward values. Further, patterns in the striatum discriminated between spaced-and massed-trained stimuli overall. Our results indicate that single-session learning tasks engage partially distinct learning mechanisms from distributed training. Our studies begin to address a large gap in our knowledge of human learning from reinforcement, with potential implications for our understanding of mood disorders and addiction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hippocampus", "Reinforcement learning", "Reward", "Spacing", "Striatum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain Mapping", "Conditioning, Operant", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Photic Stimulation", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reinforcement (Psychology)", "Reward", "Temporal Lobe", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052629769", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"15729632900": {"Name": "Wimmer G.E.", "AuthorID": "15729632900", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University"}, "57216662662": {"Name": "Li J.K.", "AuthorID": "57216662662", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University"}, "55355064700": {"Name": "Gorgolewski K.J.", "AuthorID": "55355064700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University"}, "7004739390": {"Name": "Poldrack R.A.", "AuthorID": "7004739390", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Stanford University"}}}
