This data is sometimes published after the application of simple anonymization techniques, which might lead to severe privacy threats. We propose in this paper a new solution whose novelty is two-fold. Firstly, we introduce an algorithm designed to hide places where a user stops during her journey (namely points of interest), by enforcing a constant speed along her trajectory. Secondly, we leverage places where users meet to take a chance to swap their trajectories and therefore confuse an attacker.", "AuthorKeywords": ["data publication", "Location privacy", "time distortion", "Trajectories swapping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Constant speed", "Data publications", "Location privacy", "Mobile phone operators", "Mobility datum", "Points of interest", "Privacy preserving", "Privacy threats"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944323972", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56904302900": {"Name": "Primault V.", "AuthorID": "56904302900", "AffiliationID": "60016253, 60108341, 60008134, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, CNRS, INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, UMR5205"}, "13103948100": {"Name": "Mokhtar S.", "AuthorID": "13103948100", "AffiliationID": "60016253, 60108341, 60008134, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, CNRS, INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, UMR5205"}, "6701681035": {"Name": "Brunie L.", "AuthorID": "6701681035", "AffiliationID": "60016253, 60108341, 60008134, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, CNRS, INSA-Lyon, LIRIS, UMR5205"}}}
