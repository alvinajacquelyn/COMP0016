However, few studies have considered the effect of tidal flow on scour development. This paper reports on a flume investigation of scour through a spring-neap tidal cycle around a monopile foundation. Comparison was made with tests under reversing flow and unidirectional current both with a velocity of constant amplitude.A scale marked onto the pile and a photogrammetry technique enabled analysis of the scour hole development during the tests. In the reversing flow case where the velocity was of constant amplitude, there was little change to the maximum scour depth after only a few flow reversals, and the depth reached was considerably less than in the unidirectional case. In the spring-neap test it was clear that equilibrium depth had not been achieved after one spring-neap cycle. This indicates that the spring-neap cycle has a significant impact on the time-scale of scour development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Constant amplitude", "Cost effective", "Flow reversals", "Laboratory investigations", "Marine environment", "Scour depth", "Scour holes", "Time-scales"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942134732", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"]], "AuthorData": {"57195944067": {"Name": "Porter K.E.", "AuthorID": "57195944067", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "37119653800": {"Name": "Simons R.R.", "AuthorID": "37119653800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55740182600": {"Name": "Harris J.M.", "AuthorID": "55740182600", "AffiliationID": "60025658", "AffiliationName": "HR Wallingford"}}}
