Clearly, in severe systemic inflammatory states, like sepsis, cellular metabolism is usually altered, and end organ dysfunction is not only common, but also predictive of long-term morbidity and mortality. Clearly, interest is mitochondrial function both as a target for intracellular injury and response to extrinsic stress have been a major focus of basic science and clinical research into the pathophysiology of acute illness. However, mitochondria have multiple metabolic and signaling functions that may be central in both the expression of sepsis and its ultimate outcome. In this review, the authors address five primary questions centered on the role of mitochondria in sepsis. This review should be used both as a summary source in placing mitochondrial physiology within the context of acute illness and as a focal point for addressing new research into diagnostic and treatment opportunities these insights provide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consensus", "critical illness", "mitochondria sepsis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Oxidative Phosphorylation", "Sepsis", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959129524", "SubjectAreas": [["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"23975738700": {"Name": "Arulkumaran N.", "AuthorID": "23975738700", "AffiliationID": "60024629", "AffiliationName": "Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital London"}, "7004159567": {"Name": "Deutschman C.S.", "AuthorID": "7004159567", "AffiliationID": "60107658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Molecular Medicine, Hofstra-North Shore-Long Island Jewish School of Medicine"}, "6602739165": {"Name": "Zuckerbraun B.", "AuthorID": "6602739165", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine"}, "7006797787": {"Name": "Schumacker P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006797787", "AffiliationID": "60013227, 60007363", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pediatrics-Neonatology, Cell and Molecular Biology and Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"}, "7103213902": {"Name": "Pinsky M.R.", "AuthorID": "7103213902", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Critical Care Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine"}, "24334777700": {"Name": "Gomez H.", "AuthorID": "24334777700", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Center for Critical Care Nephrology, University of Pittsburgh"}, "7103325757": {"Name": "Kellum J.A.", "AuthorID": "7103325757", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Center for Critical Care Nephrology, University of Pittsburgh"}, "56939837800": {"Name": "Gomez A.", "AuthorID": "56939837800", "AffiliationID": "118503325", "AffiliationName": "Division of Critical Care Medicine, Cl\u00ednica Palermo"}, "7402596639": {"Name": "Murray P.", "AuthorID": "7402596639", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "University College Dublin"}}}
