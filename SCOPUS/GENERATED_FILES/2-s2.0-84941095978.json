Objective: Our study's objective was to investigate the association between empirically derived DPs in midlife and HA after 13 y of follow-up. Methods: Baseline dietary data from repeated 24-h dietary records (on average, 10 records per participant) of a subsample of the SU.VI.MAX (SUppl\u00e9mentation en Vitamines et Min\u00e9raux AntioXydants) study allowed extraction of 2 DPs with the use of principal components analysis on 37 food groups. HA was assessed in 2007-2009 among 2796 participants of the SU.VI.MAX study aged 45-60 y at baseline (1994-1995), who were initially free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. HA was defined as not developing any major chronic disease, good physical and cognitive functioning, no limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, no depressive symptoms, no health-related limitations in social life, good overall self-perceived health, and no function-limiting pain. The association between DPs (in tertiles) and HA was evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression, and a potential interaction with energy intake was investigated. Results: A \"Western\" and a \"healthy\" DP were identified. After adjustment for a large number of potential confounders, there was no significant association between the Western DP and HA. Moreover, the healthy pattern was not associated with HA among subjects with high (i.e., greater than or equal to the median) energy intake. Among subjects with low (i.e., less than the median) energy intake, on the other hand, higher scores on the healthy DP were related to higher odds of HA (OR for tertile 3 vs. tertile 1: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.00; P-trend = 0.01). Conclusion: Adherence to a healthy diet in midlife that provides micronutrients, fiber, and antioxidants while regulating energy intake may help to promote HA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dietary patterns", "Energy intake", "Healthy aging", "Midlife exposure", "Nutrition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Aging", "Antioxidants", "Appetite Regulation", "Cognition", "Diet Records", "Diet, Western", "Dietary Fiber", "Energy Intake", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Food Habits", "Health Behavior", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Micronutrients", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941095978", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"56344930900": {"Name": "Assmann K.E.", "AuthorID": "56344930900", "AffiliationID": "60009647, 60014541, 60123163, 60112042", "AffiliationName": "Univ. of Paris 13, EREN, Centre of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cite, National Inst. of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) U1153, National Inst. for Agricultural Research (INRA) U1125, CNAM, COMUE Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "35798512000": {"Name": "Lassale C.", "AuthorID": "35798512000", "AffiliationID": "60009647, 60014541, 60123163, 60112042", "AffiliationName": "Univ. of Paris 13, EREN, Centre of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cite, National Inst. of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) U1153, National Inst. for Agricultural Research (INRA) U1125, CNAM, COMUE Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "14830202900": {"Name": "Andreeva V.A.", "AuthorID": "14830202900", "AffiliationID": "60009647, 60014541, 60123163, 60112042", "AffiliationName": "Univ. of Paris 13, EREN, Centre of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cite, National Inst. of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) U1153, National Inst. for Agricultural Research (INRA) U1125, CNAM, COMUE Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "56386887800": {"Name": "Hercberg S.", "AuthorID": "56386887800", "AffiliationID": "60008800", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, H\u00f4pital Avicenne"}, "36484310400": {"Name": "Galan P.", "AuthorID": "36484310400", "AffiliationID": "60009647, 60014541, 60123163, 60112042", "AffiliationName": "Univ. of Paris 13, EREN, Centre of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cite, National Inst. of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) U1153, National Inst. for Agricultural Research (INRA) U1125, CNAM, COMUE Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "35573782000": {"Name": "Kesse-Guyot E.", "AuthorID": "35573782000", "AffiliationID": "60009647, 60014541, 60123163, 60112042", "AffiliationName": "Univ. of Paris 13, EREN, Centre of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cite, National Inst. of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) U1153, National Inst. for Agricultural Research (INRA) U1125, CNAM, COMUE Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9"}, "7103078963": {"Name": "Jeandel C.", "AuthorID": "7103078963", "AffiliationID": "60031773, 60108488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatrics, Centre Balm\u00e8s, CHU Montpellier, Universit\u00e9 Montpellier I"}}}
