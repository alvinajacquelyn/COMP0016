Study focus: In addition to monsoons and strong climate variability, GB is facing growing demands for freshwater availability by a continually growing population and rapidly developing of agricultural and industrial sectors. The management of water resources is thus of highest priority and, in the context of current over-abstraction of groundwater, accurate estimates of terrestrial freshwater storage are essential. We propose a multi-satellite approach to estimate surface freshwater storage (SWS) and subsurface water storage (SSWS, groundwater. +. soil moisture) variations over GB. New hydrological insights: Basin-scale monthly SWS variations for the period 2003-2007 show a mean annual amplitude of ~410km3, contributing to about 45% of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived total water storage variations (TWS). During the drought-like conditions in 2006, we estimate that the SWS deficit over the entire GB basin in July-August-September was about 30% as compared to other years. The SWS variations are then used to decompose the GB GRACE-derived TWS and isolate the variations of SSWS whose mean annual amplitude is estimated to be ~550km3. This new dataset of water storage variations represent an unprecedented source of information for hydrological and climate modeling studies of the ISC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ENVISAT altimetry", "Ganges-Brahmaputra", "GRACE", "Remote sensing", "Sub-surface water storage", "Surface water storage"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947466540", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"15119906600": {"Name": "Papa F.", "AuthorID": "15119906600", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "IFCWS, Indo-French Cell for Water Sciences, IRD-IISc Joint International Laboratory, Indian Institute of Science"}, "6603882400": {"Name": "Calmant S.", "AuthorID": "6603882400", "AffiliationID": "60024209, 60028993, 60017694, 60027245", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement, LEGOS, IRD/CNES/CNRS/UPS"}, "8651675100": {"Name": "Frappart F.", "AuthorID": "8651675100", "AffiliationID": "60027245, 60024209, 60102124", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, UPS, OMP-LEGOS (UPS)"}, "57193895151": {"Name": "Malbeteau Y.", "AuthorID": "57193895151", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60024767", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CESBIO"}, "22956412500": {"Name": "Shamsudduha M.", "AuthorID": "22956412500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "12141871100": {"Name": "Vuruputur V.", "AuthorID": "12141871100", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Divecha Center for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science"}, "7003745084": {"Name": "Sekhar M.", "AuthorID": "7003745084", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering and IFCWS, Indo-French Cell for Water Sciences, Indian Institute of Science"}, "8626175400": {"Name": "Ramillien G.", "AuthorID": "8626175400", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, G\u00e9osciences Environement Toulouse, OMP-GET"}, "56260361400": {"Name": "Prigent C.", "AuthorID": "56260361400", "AffiliationID": "60003674, 60008134, 60023802", "AffiliationName": "LERMA, CNRS, Observatoire de Paris"}, "6603934441": {"Name": "Aires F.", "AuthorID": "6603934441", "AffiliationID": "60116702", "AffiliationName": "Estellus"}, "57199423222": {"Name": "Pandey R.K.", "AuthorID": "57199423222", "AffiliationID": "60005720", "AffiliationName": "CSIR - National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI)"}, "15750229600": {"Name": "Bala S.", "AuthorID": "15750229600", "AffiliationID": "60021158", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Water and Flood Management, Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology"}}}
