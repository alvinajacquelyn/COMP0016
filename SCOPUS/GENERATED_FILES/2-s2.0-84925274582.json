Their transformation uses additively homomorphic encryption to encrypt the verifier\u2019s challenge, which the prover uses to compute an encrypted answer. The transformation does not rely on the random oracle model but proving soundness requires a complexity leveraging assumption. We propose an alternative instantiation of their transformation and show that it achieves culpable soundness without complexity leveraging. This improves upon an earlier result by Ventre and Visconti (Africacrypt 2009), who used a different construction which achieved weak culpable soundness. We demonstrate how our construction can be used to prove validity of encrypted votes in a referendum. This yields a voting system with homomorphic tallying that does not rely on the Fiat-Shamir heuristic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Culpable soundness", "DFN transformation", "Non-interactive zero-knowledge designated verifier argument", "Sigma-protocols", "Voting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Culpable soundness", "Designated verifiers", "DFN transformation", "Sigma protocols", "Voting"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925274582", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55348018600": {"Name": "Chaidos P.", "AuthorID": "55348018600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57204262109": {"Name": "Groth J.", "AuthorID": "57204262109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
