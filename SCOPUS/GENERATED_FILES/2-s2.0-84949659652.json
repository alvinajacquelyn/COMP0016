Contact with host membranes is critical for T3SS activation, yet little is known about T3SS architecture in this state or the conformational changes that drive effector translocation. Here we use cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging to derive the intact structure of the primordial Chlamydia trachomatis T3SS in the presence and absence of host membrane contact. Comparison of the averaged structures demonstrates a marked compaction of the basal body (4 nm) occurs when the needle tip contacts the host cell membrane. This compaction is coupled to a stabilization of the cytosolic sorting platform-ATPase. Our findings reveal the first structure of a bacterial T3SS from a major human pathogen engaged with a eukaryotic host, and reveal striking 'pump-action' conformational changes that underpin effector injection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line", "Cell Membrane", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "Cryoelectron Microscopy", "Humans", "Type III Secretion Systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949659652", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"25925899200": {"Name": "Nans A.", "AuthorID": "25925899200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Crystallography, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "35492295700": {"Name": "Saibil H.R.", "AuthorID": "35492295700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Crystallography, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College"}, "16506477900": {"Name": "Kudryashev M.", "AuthorID": "16506477900", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Buchman Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Goethe University of Frankfurt"}, "35495822100": {"Name": "Hayward R.D.", "AuthorID": "35495822100", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck and University College London"}}}
