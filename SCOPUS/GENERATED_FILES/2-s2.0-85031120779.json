Investigating the developmental origin of the positive manifold is crucial to understanding it. In a large longitudinal cohort of adolescents and young adults (N = 785; n = 566 across two waves, mean interval between waves = 1.48 years; age range = 14\u201325 years), we examined developmental changes in two core cognitive domains, fluid reasoning and vocabulary. We used bivariate latent change score models to compare three leading accounts of cognitive development: g-factor theory, investment theory, and mutualism. We showed that a mutualism model, which proposes that basic cognitive abilities directly and positively interact during development, provides the best account of developmental changes. We found that individuals with higher scores in vocabulary showed greater gains in matrix reasoning and vice versa. These dynamic coupling pathways are not predicted by other accounts and provide a novel mechanistic window into cognitive development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive development", "fluid reasoning", "longitudinal modeling", "mutualism", "open data", "vocabulary"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cognition", "Female", "Human Development", "Humans", "Male", "Thinking", "Vocabulary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031120779", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"36967508600": {"Name": "Kievit R.A.", "AuthorID": "36967508600", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "7003644686": {"Name": "Lindenberger U.", "AuthorID": "7003644686", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7005728308": {"Name": "Goodyer I.M.", "AuthorID": "7005728308", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "56489064900": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "56489064900", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "35405771500": {"Name": "Bullmore E.T.", "AuthorID": "35405771500", "AffiliationID": "60032894, 60015879, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Wellcome Trust Behavioural and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
