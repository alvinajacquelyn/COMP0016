In this paper, we focus on universities in Canada to provide an integrative review of the changing sociospatial relations of cities and universities in an era of increasing neoliberal and globalized development agendas. We treat these relationships in spatial and institutional terms, recognizing that actors and decision-makers in government and academic bodies understand their links as a combination of both. Our analysis destabilizes established normative understandings regarding the sociospatial structure and governance of the university and the interrelations between universities and urban space. Numerous spatial strategies demonstrate that universities\u2019 relations are multi-layered, multi-scaled and multiply topological. Yet while they may be well positioned to adopt a proactive role in shaping economic development and civic agendas, universities have no privileged position in their communities. Despite acting as deliberate place-making agents in rapidly changing metropolitan environments, universities remain located in, yet apart from, their urban and regional context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Higher-education", "Innovation", "Institutions", "Regional development", "Territory", "Topology", "Urbanization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934773851", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"26632935200": {"Name": "Addie J.", "AuthorID": "26632935200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science Technology, Engineering and Public Policy, University College London"}, "7102728834": {"Name": "Keil R.", "AuthorID": "7102728834", "AffiliationID": "60033420", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Environmental Studies, York University"}, "6701313560": {"Name": "Olds K.", "AuthorID": "6701313560", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}}}
