We hypothesize that APOE isoforms have differential effects on synaptic function. Methods We compared levels of CSF neurogranin (Ng) between APOE \u03b54 carriers and noncarriers in 399 subjects with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. We examined associations between Ng levels and age, education, gender, CSF-A\u03b242, and tau protein. Results Neurogranin levels were significantly higher in APOE \u03b54 carriers compared to APOE \u03b54 noncarriers with MCI. Levels of Ng between the APOE \u03b54 carriers and APOE \u03b54 noncarriers with AD did not differ. Ng levels were correlated with MMSE and levels of tau and A\u03b242. Discussion Significantly higher CSF Ng levels in APOE \u03b54 carriers with MCI may reflect synaptic injury underlying early cognitive impairment. Neurogranin may be an early biomarker of AD and important for disease diagnosis and timing of intervention in APOE \u03b54 carriers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "APOE", "APOE \u03b54", "Mild cognitive impairment", "Neurogranin", "Synaptic function"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Biomarkers", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Disease Progression", "Educational Status", "Female", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Nuclear Proteins", "Peptide Fragments", "Risk", "Sex Factors", "Synapses", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979623005", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7405624314": {"Name": "Sun X.", "AuthorID": "7405624314", "AffiliationID": "60021519, 60013959", "AffiliationName": "Evelyn F.
