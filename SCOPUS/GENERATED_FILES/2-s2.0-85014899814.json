The IOT directly impacted the Bay of Bengal and east Africa, with over 283,000 people perishing. At the time, this catastrophic event was considered unprecedented and sparked intense investigations to test this claim. It is now believed that four pre-2004 IOT events have occurred in the last 2500 years, recurring every 550 to 700 years. Much of this information comes from Phra Thong Island, Thailand, where a sequence of four stacked sandsheets separated by organic units has been recognised and compared to the 2004 IOT event. Recently, ground-penetrating radar on Phra Thong Island identified a region that could not be explained by the known stratigraphy. The stratigraphy of the area was investigated from auger cores and pits, and several previously-unrecognised sandsheets were identified and compared to the known tsunami sandsheets. The proximity of the newly-recognised sandsheets to the palaeo-coastline of Phra Thong Island does not preclude the impacts of localised storms in sandsheet emplacement or that tsunamigenic earthquake recurrence may have been more frequent in the past.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014899814", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"36172890400": {"Name": "Gouramanis C.", "AuthorID": "36172890400", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, National University of Singapore"}, "56638636500": {"Name": "Ildefonso S.R.", "AuthorID": "56638636500", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, National University of Singapore"}, "10738884500": {"Name": "Switzer A.D.", "AuthorID": "10738884500", "AffiliationID": "60118475, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "Asian School of the Environment, Nanyang Technological University Singapore"}, "23481875300": {"Name": "Jankaew K.", "AuthorID": "23481875300", "AffiliationID": "60028190", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, Chulalongkorn University Bangkok"}, "7005846622": {"Name": "Bristow C.S.", "AuthorID": "7005846622", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "56457567700": {"Name": "Pham D.T.", "AuthorID": "56457567700", "AffiliationID": "116728267", "AffiliationName": "Viet Nam Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change"}}}
