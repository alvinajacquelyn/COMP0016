However, the role of CTRP3 involved in renal fibrosis remains unclear. Our current study explored the role of CTRP3 in renal fibrosis and its underlying mechanisms by using serums and renal biopsy specimens from renal fibrosis patients and control subjects, rats models with the surgery of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) and human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HRPTEpiCs). We found that circulating levels of CTRP3 had no significant difference between renal fibrosis patients and healthy subjects; however, renal CTRP3 expression was markedly downregulated in the fibrotic region with an abundant expression of collagen-I. In UUO rat models, circulating levels of CTRP3 have not changed with the prolonged obstruction of the kidney; renal CTRP3 expression was decreased with the severity of renal fibrosis; adenovirus-mediated CTRP3 treatment inhibited renal interstitial fibrosis. In vitro experiments revealed that CTRP3 attenuates TGF-\u03b21 induced tubular epithelial cells fibrotic changes; CTRP3 knockdown facilitates the expression of fibrotic markers in TGF-\u03b21-induced HRPTEpiCs; recombinant CTRP3 or adenovirus-mediated CTRP3 overexpression significantly inhibited the Notch signaling pathway-associated factors, and knockdown of CTRP3 increased TGF-\u03b21-mediated activation of the Notch signaling pathways. Collectively, our current study found that CTRP3 could improve renal fibrosis, to some extent, through inhibiting the Notch pathway.", "AuthorKeywords": ["C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP3)", "Notch signaling pathway", "renal interstitial fibrosis", "TGF-\u03b21", "tubular epithelial cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenoviridae", "Animals", "Epithelial Cells", "Fibrosis", "Gene Silencing", "Humans", "Kidney", "Kidney Tubules, Proximal", "Male", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, Notch", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Signal Transduction", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1", "Tumor Necrosis Factors", "Ureteral Obstruction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071173679", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57210642275": {"Name": "Chen X.", "AuthorID": "57210642275", "AffiliationID": "60073435, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Faculty of Kidney Diseases, Capital Medical University"}, "57188538412": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57188538412", "AffiliationID": "60073435, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Faculty of Kidney Diseases, Capital Medical University"}, "56950210800": {"Name": "Diao Z.", "AuthorID": "56950210800", "AffiliationID": "60073435, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Faculty of Kidney Diseases, Capital Medical University"}, "55841552100": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "55841552100", "AffiliationID": "60073435, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Faculty of Kidney Diseases, Capital Medical University"}, "57195459641": {"Name": "Li D.", "AuthorID": "57195459641", "AffiliationID": "60073435, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Faculty of Kidney Diseases, Capital Medical University"}, "57198620399": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "57198620399", "AffiliationID": "60073435, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, Beijing Friendship Hospital, Faculty of Kidney Diseases, Capital Medical University"}, "57211200170": {"Name": "Ruan X.", "AuthorID": "57211200170", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, John Moorhead Research Laboratory, University College London Medical School, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}}}
