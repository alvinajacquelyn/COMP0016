Conversely, we show that any such representation that admits a compact (with respect to the product of weak topologies) sub-differential generates a dynamic risk measure that is strong--weak continuous. Furthermore, we investigate sufficient conditions on the sub-differential for which the essential supremum of the representation is attained. Finally, the main purpose is to show that any convex dynamic risk measure that is strong-weak continuous can be approximated by a sequence of convex dynamic risk measures which are strong--weak continuous and admit compact sub-differentials with respect to the product of weak topologies. Throughout the arguments, no conditional translation invariance or monotonicity assumptions are applied.", "AuthorKeywords": ["convexity", "dynamic risk measures", "representation theorem", "Sub-differential", "weak and strong continuity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015645320", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36198696600": {"Name": "Okhrati R.", "AuthorID": "36198696600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "35408645900": {"Name": "Assa H.", "AuthorID": "35408645900", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Financial and Actuarial Mathematics, Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Liverpool"}}}
