When this condition is due to poor function of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, responsible for raising the lid, \"brow-suspension\" ptosis correction is usually performed, which involves internally attaching the malpositioned eyelid to the forehead musculature using brow-suspension materials. In service, such materials are exposed to both rapid tensile loading and unloading sequences during blinking, and a more sustained tensile strain during extended periods of closure. In this study, various mechanical tests were conducted to characterise and compare some of commonly-used synthetic brow-suspension materials (Prolene\u00ae, Supramid Extra\u00ae II, Silicone rods (Visitec\u00ae Seiff frontalis suspension set) and Mersilene\u00ae mesh) for their time-dependent response. At a given constant tensile strain or load, all of the brow-suspension materials exhibited stress-relaxation or creep, with Prolene\u00ae having a statistically different relaxation or creep ratio as compared with those of others. Uniaxial tensile cyclic tests through preconditioning and fatigue tests demonstrated drastically different time-dependent response amongst the various materials. Although the tests generated hysteresis force-strain loops for all materials, the mechanical properties such as the number of cycles required to reach the steady-state, the reduction in the peak force, and the cyclic energy dissipation varied considerably. To reach the steady-state, Prolene\u00ae and the silicone rod required the greatest and the least number of cycles, respectively. Furthermore, the fatigue tests at physiologically relevant conditions (15% strain controlled at 6.5Hz) demonstrated that the reduction in the peak force during 100,000 cycles ranged from 15% to 58%, with Prolene\u00ae and the silicone rod exhibiting the greatest and the least value, respectively.Many factors need to be considered to select the most suitable brow-suspension material for ptosis correction. These novel data on the mechanical time-dependent performance could therefore help to guide clinicians in their decision-making process for optimal surgical outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cyclic energy dissipation", "Decision making process", "Fatigue behaviour", "Strain-controlled", "Suspension materials", "Time-dependent performance", "Time-dependent response", "Uniaxial tensile", "Eyelids", "Materials Testing", "Muscles", "Prostheses and Implants", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84913557906", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"55791552100": {"Name": "Kwon K.A.", "AuthorID": "55791552100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "24921854100": {"Name": "Shipley R.J.", "AuthorID": "24921854100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006247915": {"Name": "Edirisinghe M.", "AuthorID": "7006247915", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "22951631400": {"Name": "Rayment A.W.", "AuthorID": "22951631400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, University of Cambridge"}, "7102270379": {"Name": "Best S.M.", "AuthorID": "7102270379", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, University of Cambridge"}, "7202537660": {"Name": "Cameron R.E.", "AuthorID": "7202537660", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, Cambridge Centre for Medical Materials, University of Cambridge"}, "35071912100": {"Name": "Salam T.", "AuthorID": "35071912100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology"}, "55531206700": {"Name": "Rose G.E.", "AuthorID": "55531206700", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology"}, "11439021900": {"Name": "Ezra D.G.", "AuthorID": "11439021900", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology"}}}
