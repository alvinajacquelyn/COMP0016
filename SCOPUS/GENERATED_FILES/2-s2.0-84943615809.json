Quasi-static tests are performed on six 5-m-high plasterboard internal partitions, which represent typical partitions in industrial and commercial buildings in the European area. A steel test setup is designed to transfer the load, which is provided by the actuator, to the partition. The testing protocol provided by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) 461 is adopted for the quasi-static tests. The typical failure mode of the specimens is the buckling of a steel stud, which involves the boards that are attached to the buckled stud. The buckling failure usually concentrates across the plasterboard horizontal joints. A frictional behavior is exhibited for low demand levels, whereas a pinched behavior is shown for moderate-to-high demand levels. The interstory drift ratios required to reach a given damage limit state are evaluated using a predefined damage scheme. Based on the experimental data, the fragility curves for three different damage states (DS1, DS2, and DS3) are estimated. The fragility curve yields median interstory drift ratio values of 0.28%, 0.81%, and 2.05% and logarithmic standard deviations of 0.39, 0.42, and 0.46 for DS1, DS2, and DS3, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fragility curves", "Internal partitions", "Nonstructural components", "Quasi-static test", "Seismic performance", "Testing protocol"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fragility curves", "Internal partitions", "Non-structural components", "Quasi-static tests", "Seismic Performance", "Testing protocols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943615809", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"53866932600": {"Name": "Petrone C.", "AuthorID": "53866932600", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structures for Engineering and Architecture, University of Naples Federico II"}, "22938105100": {"Name": "Magliulo G.", "AuthorID": "22938105100", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structures for Engineering and Architecture, University of Naples Federico II"}, "7005193798": {"Name": "Manfredi G.", "AuthorID": "7005193798", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structures for Engineering and Architecture, University of Naples Federico II"}, "55363194600": {"Name": "Lopez P.", "AuthorID": "55363194600", "AffiliationID": "113084004", "AffiliationName": "Product Development Department, Etex Dry Co"}}}
