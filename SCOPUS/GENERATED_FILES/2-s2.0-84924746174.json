Here we report the construction of a set of 281 haploid gene deletion strains covering many previously uncharacterized genes. This collection of strains was tested for growth under a variety of different stress conditions. We identified new genes involved in DNA metabolism, completion of the cell cycle, and morphogenesis. This subset of nonessential gene deletions will add to the toolkits available for the study of biological processes in S. pombe.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell division", "DNA metabolism", "Fission yeast", "Gene deletion", "Stress sensitivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Division", "DNA Damage", "Gene Deletion", "Genes, Fungal", "Schizosaccharomyces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924746174", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"8446232200": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "8446232200", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "6603069895": {"Name": "Beckley J.", "AuthorID": "6603069895", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "56481223300": {"Name": "McDonald N.", "AuthorID": "56481223300", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "41561892800": {"Name": "Ren L.", "AuthorID": "41561892800", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "56549082400": {"Name": "Mangione M.", "AuthorID": "56549082400", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "56547910200": {"Name": "Jang S.", "AuthorID": "56547910200", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "53879646600": {"Name": "Elmore Z.", "AuthorID": "53879646600", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "18635569000": {"Name": "Rachfall N.", "AuthorID": "18635569000", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "6701608240": {"Name": "Feoktistova A.", "AuthorID": "6701608240", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "56547756600": {"Name": "Jones C.", "AuthorID": "56547756600", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "55206823800": {"Name": "Willet A.", "AuthorID": "55206823800", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "56364232100": {"Name": "Guillen R.", "AuthorID": "56364232100", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "35310146300": {"Name": "Gould K.", "AuthorID": "35310146300", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "23983920600": {"Name": "Bitton D.", "AuthorID": "23983920600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment and UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6603788294": {"Name": "B\u00e4hler J.", "AuthorID": "6603788294", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment and UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "23099850000": {"Name": "Jensen M.", "AuthorID": "23099850000", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Genome Technology Center, Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "6603138796": {"Name": "Rhind N.", "AuthorID": "6603138796", "AffiliationID": "60000986", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, University of Massachusetts Medical School"}}}
