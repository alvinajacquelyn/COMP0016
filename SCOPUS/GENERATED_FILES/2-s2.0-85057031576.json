Design: A cost-utility analysis based on a clinical trial and decision analytic model. Participants: Children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age with persistently active uveitis associated with JIA, despite optimized methotrexate treatment for at least 12 weeks. Methods: The SYCAMORE (Randomised controlled trial of the clinical effectiveness, SafetY and Cost effectiveness of Adalimumab in combination with MethOtRExate for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis) trial (identifier, ISRCTN10065623) of methotrexate (up to 25 mg weekly) with or without fortnightly administered adalimumab (20 or 40 mg, according to body weight) provided data on resource use (based on patient self-report and electronic records) and health utilities (from the Health Utilities Index questionnaire). Surgical event rates and long-term outcomes were based on data from a 10-year longitudinal cohort. A Markov model was used to extrapolate the effects of treatment based on visual impairment. Main Outcome Measures: Medical costs to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, utility of defined health states, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY. Results: Adalimumab in combination with methotrexate resulted in additional costs of \u00a339 316, with a 0.30 QALY gain compared with methotrexate alone, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \u00a3129 025 per QALY gained. The probability of cost effectiveness at a threshold of \u00a330 000 per QALY was less than 1%. Based on a threshold analysis, a price reduction of 84% would be necessary for adalimumab to be cost effective. Conclusions: Adalimumab is clinically effective in uveitis associated with JIA; however, its cost effectiveness is not demonstrated compared with methotrexate alone in the United Kingdom setting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adalimumab", "Adolescent", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Arthritis, Juvenile", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cost Savings", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Cross-Over Studies", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Costs", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Models, Economic", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "State Medicine", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom", "Uveitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057031576", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"35570067600": {"Name": "Hughes D.A.", "AuthorID": "35570067600", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, Bangor University"}, "57204056661": {"Name": "Culeddu G.", "AuthorID": "57204056661", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, Bangor University"}, "25960268100": {"Name": "Plumpton C.O.", "AuthorID": "25960268100", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, Bangor University"}, "56706867700": {"Name": "Wood E.", "AuthorID": "56706867700", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics and Medicines Evaluation, Bangor University"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "7003605847": {"Name": "Ramanan A.V.", "AuthorID": "7003605847", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26660306600": {"Name": "Jones A.P.", "AuthorID": "26660306600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "55208580100": {"Name": "McKay A.", "AuthorID": "55208580100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "57212501855": {"Name": "Williamson P.R.", "AuthorID": "57212501855", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "55999128200": {"Name": "Hardwick B.", "AuthorID": "55999128200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "8733037100": {"Name": "Hickey H.", "AuthorID": "8733037100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "6603662700": {"Name": "Beresford M.W.", "AuthorID": "6603662700", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8210058200": {"Name": "Compeyrot Lacassagne S.", "AuthorID": "8210058200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55416171000": {"Name": "Woo P.", "AuthorID": "55416171000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
