To optimize specific goals such as maximizing revenue and return on investment (ROI) led by ad placements, advertisers not only need to estimate the relevance between the ads and user's interests, but most importantly require a strategic response with respect to other advertisers bidding in the market. In this paper, we formulate bidding optimization with multi-agent reinforcement learning. To deal with a large number of advertisers, we propose a clustering method and assign each cluster with a strategic bidding agent. A practical Distributed Coordinated Multi-Agent Bidding (DCMAB) has been proposed and implemented to balance the tradeoff between the competition and cooperation among advertisers. The empirical study on our industry-scaled real-world data has demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods. Our results show cluster-based bidding would largely outperform single-agent and bandit approaches, and the coordinated bidding achieves better overall objectives than purely self-interested bidding agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bid Optimization", "Display Advertising", "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning", "Real-Time Bidding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bid optimizations", "Clustering methods", "Competition and cooperation", "Display advertisings", "Multi-agent reinforcement learning", "Real time biddings", "Return on investments", "Strategic response"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058047493", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (all)", "DECI", "1800"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"57195601293": {"Name": "Jin J.", "AuthorID": "57195601293", "AffiliationID": "60118460", "AffiliationName": "Alibaba Group"}, "57203394509": {"Name": "Song C.", "AuthorID": "57203394509", "AffiliationID": "60118460", "AffiliationName": "Alibaba Group"}, "57189660257": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57189660257", "AffiliationID": "60118460", "AffiliationName": "Alibaba Group"}, "57195597860": {"Name": "Gai K.", "AuthorID": "57195597860", "AffiliationID": "60118460", "AffiliationName": "Alibaba Group"}, "55902731900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55902731900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56108513500": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "56108513500", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai JiaoTong University"}}}
