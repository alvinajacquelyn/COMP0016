An iterative prototype of a lightweight three-dimensional-printable wearable ultrasound transducer stabilization system that allows flexible jaw motion and free head movement is presented. The system is completely non-metallic, eliminating interference with co-recorded signals, thus permitting co-collection and co-registration with articulometry systems. A motion study of the final version demonstrates that transducer rotation is limited to 1.25\u00b0 and translation to 2.5 mm - well within accepted tolerances.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coregistration", "Motion study", "Non-metallic", "Recorded signals", "Speech recording", "Stabilization systems", "Ultrasound imaging", "Ultrasound transducers", "Germany", "Head Movements", "Humans", "Jaw", "Male", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Speech", "Speech Articulation Tests", "Tongue", "Transducers", "Ultrasonography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056355003", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"25627056500": {"Name": "Derrick D.", "AuthorID": "25627056500", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "MARCS Institute, Western Sydney University"}, "48461054200": {"Name": "Carignan C.", "AuthorID": "48461054200", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing (IPS), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t"}, "56814263400": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "56814263400", "AffiliationID": "60030102", "AffiliationName": "Haskins Laboratories"}, "7006972239": {"Name": "Best C.", "AuthorID": "7006972239", "AffiliationID": "60107806, 60017803", "AffiliationName": "MARCS Institute, Western Sydney University"}, "36609020300": {"Name": "Shujau M.", "AuthorID": "36609020300", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sydney"}}}
