The material was annealed in a furnace at 90 \u00b0C for 2 h and 550 \u00b0C for 2 h to create a silica fibre core surrounded by concentric layers of silicalite-1 and TiO2. The resulting samples were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement. The photocatalytic activity of the samples was evaluated using the intelligent ink test and during degradation of stearic acid under UVA light (\u03bb = 365 nm). The new coated-fibres were shown to be substantially better photocatalysts than comparable TiO2 coatings on plain glass fibres. The TiO2/S1/glass fibres have potential use in air/water cleaning applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brunauer-emmett-teller surface areas", "Photocatalytic activities", "Silica fibres", "Silicalite-1", "TiO", "UV-A light"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920836634", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56478592600": {"Name": "Ozkan F.", "AuthorID": "56478592600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "16744209400": {"Name": "Quesada-Cabrera R.", "AuthorID": "16744209400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
