METHODS: We recruited white, nondiabetic men into a cross-sectional substudy of a larger cohort including 3 demographically matched groups. Optic disc-centered 45-degree color fundus photographs were used to calculate central retinal arterial and venous caliber and the arterial-venous ratio (AVR). We used univariate and multivariable linear regression to compare retinal vessel measurements in the 3 groups and to identify factors associated with AVR. RESULTS: All HIV-positive men were virologically suppressed. In a multivariable model, study group was not associated with AVR [adjusted \u03b2 0.010 for HIV-positive men <50 (n = 39) compared with HIV-positive men aged \u226550 years (n = 120), 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.018 to 0.038, P = 0.47; adjusted \u03b2 0.00002 for HIV-negative men \u226550 years (n = 52), 95% CI -0.022 to 0.022, P = 0.99]. Factors associated with lower AVR were systolic blood pressure (adjusted \u03b2 -0.009 per +10 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.015 to -0.003, P = 0.002), history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (adjusted \u03b2 -0.070, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.015, P = 0.01), and recent recreational drug use (adjusted \u03b2 -0.037, 95% CI -0.057 to -0.018, P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in retinal vascular indices between HIV-positive men aged \u226550 years and HIV-negative men aged \u226550 years or HIV-positive men aged <50 years, suggesting that HIV is not associated with an increased burden of cerebral small vessel disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Biomarkers", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Fundus Oculi", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Ophthalmoscopy", "Retinal Vessels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057247491", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55941510300": {"Name": "Haddow L.", "AuthorID": "55941510300", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health and HIV, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57193824907": {"Name": "Laverick R.", "AuthorID": "57193824907", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research in Infection and Sexual Health, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57209757944": {"Name": "Gilson R.", "AuthorID": "57209757944", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health and HIV, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57206923926": {"Name": "Williams I.", "AuthorID": "57206923926", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Sexual Health and HIV, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Research in Infection and Sexual Health, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "21743201400": {"Name": "Leung I.", "AuthorID": "21743201400", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "Reading Centre, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7005772831": {"Name": "Peto T.", "AuthorID": "7005772831", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Public Health, Queen's University Belfast"}, "57203678070": {"Name": "Post F.", "AuthorID": "57203678070", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "HIV Research Centre, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26638548500": {"Name": "Vera J.", "AuthorID": "26638548500", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Global Health and Infection, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "7004703572": {"Name": "Boffito M.", "AuthorID": "7004703572", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "St Stephen's AIDS Trust, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
