The effect of alkali concentration and modulus of sodium silicate solution used in AAS was studied. Chloride transport and corrosion properties were assessed with the help of electrical resistivity, non-steady state chloride diffusivity, onset of corrosion, rate of corrosion and pore solution chemistry. It was found that: (i) although chloride content at surface was higher for the AAS concretes, they had lower chloride diffusivity than PC concrete; (ii) pore structure, ionic exchange and interaction effect of hydrates strongly influenced the chloride transport in the AAS concretes; (iii) steel corrosion resistance of the AAS concretes was comparable to that of PC concrete under intermittent chloride ponding regime, with the exception of 6 % Na2O and Ms of 1.5; (iv) the corrosion behaviour of the AAS concretes was significantly influenced by ionic exchange, carbonation and sulphide concentration; (v) the increase of alkali concentration of the activator generally increased the resistance of AAS concretes to chloride transport and reduced its resulting corrosion, and a value of 1.5 was found to be an optimum modulus for the activator for improving the chloride transport and the corrosion resistance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alkali activated slag", "Bulk electrical resistivity", "Chloride diffusivity", "pH profile", "Pore solution chemistry", "Rate of corrosion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkali activated slags", "Alkali-activated slag concretes", "Chloride diffusivity", "Corrosion of steel bars", "Pore solution chemistry", "Rate of corrosions", "Sodium silicate solutions", "Sulphide concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950239458", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"56303897800": {"Name": "Ma Q.", "AuthorID": "56303897800", "AffiliationID": "60020675", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Civil Engineering and Mechanics, Kunming University of Science and Technology"}, "23036324000": {"Name": "Nanukuttan S.", "AuthorID": "23036324000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Planning, Architecture and Civil Engineering, Queen\u2019s University Belfast"}, "8612834400": {"Name": "Basheer P.", "AuthorID": "8612834400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "55461062100": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55461062100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "8231310800": {"Name": "Yang C.", "AuthorID": "8231310800", "AffiliationID": "60023380", "AffiliationName": "College of Material Science and Engineering, Chongqing University"}}}
