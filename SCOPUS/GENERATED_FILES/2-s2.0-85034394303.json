Then, it also discusses the economic, psychological and neurological roots of problem gambling. Roulette is a good game to discuss loss chasing. Loss chasing is characteristic of problem gamblers, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5). Problem gambling (gambling addiction, pathological gambling) is a mental disorder defined by DSM-5 as \u2018persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress\u2019. For less severe problem gamblers, brief interventions such as warning messages have been used to reduce the gambling behaviour. This approach appears to be useful to some of them but not for others. Courses of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) typically last longer than brief interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Card games", "Cognitive biases", "Cognitive-behavioural therapy", "Economic psychology", "Fruit machines", "Loss chasing", "Lottery", "Problem gambling", "Roulette", "Sports betting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034394303", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"56040317300": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "56040317300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57206194829": {"Name": "Harvey N.", "AuthorID": "57206194829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
