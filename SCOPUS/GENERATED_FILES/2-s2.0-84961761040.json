In this paper we alleviate the computational load of these algorithms by proposing an efficient approach for predicting the match ability of a template, before it is actually performed. This avoids large amounts of unnecessary computations. We learn the match ability of templates by using dense convolutional neural network descriptors that do not require ad-hoc criteria to characterize a template. By using deep learning descriptions of patches we are able to predict match ability over the whole image quite reliably. We will also show how no specific training data is required to solve problems like panorama stitching in which you usually require data from the scene in question. Due to the highly parallelizable nature of this tasks we offer an efficient technique with a negligible computational cost at test time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Approximation algorithms", "Approximation methods", "Computational efficiency", "Detectors", "Prediction algorithms", "Robustness", "Search problems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximation methods", "Computational costs", "Computational loads", "Convolutional neural network", "Deep learning", "Parameter spaces", "Prediction algorithms", "Search problem"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961761040", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"26421312300": {"Name": "Penate-Sanchez A.", "AuthorID": "26421312300", "AffiliationID": "60007592, 60006754, 60030064", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Rob\u00f2tica i Inform\u00e0tica Industrial, UPC-CSIC"}, "24076818700": {"Name": "Moreno-Noguer F.", "AuthorID": "24076818700", "AffiliationID": "60007592, 60006754, 60030064", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Rob\u00f2tica i Inform\u00e0tica Industrial, UPC-CSIC"}, "55515716900": {"Name": "Porzi L.", "AuthorID": "55515716900", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "University of Perugia"}}}
