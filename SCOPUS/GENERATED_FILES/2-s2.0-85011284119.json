This encephalopathy is characterized by coma and is thought to result from mechanical microvessel obstruction and an excessive activation of immune cells leading to pathological inflammation and blood-brain barrier alterations. IL-22 contributes to both chronic inflammatory and infectious diseases, and may have protective or pathogenic effects, depending on the tissue and disease state. We evaluated whether polymorphisms (n = 46) of IL22 and IL22RA2 were associated with CM in children from Nigeria and Mali. Two SNPs of IL22, rs1012356 (P = 0.016, OR = 2.12) and rs2227476 (P = 0.007, OR = 2.08) were independently associated with CM in a sample of 115 Nigerian children with CM and 160 controls. The association with rs2227476 (P = 0.01) was replicated in 240 nuclear families with one affected child from Mali. SNP rs2227473, in linkage disequilibrium with rs2227476, was also associated with CM in the combined cohort for these two populations, (P = 0.004, OR = 1.55). SNP rs2227473 is located within a putative binding site for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, a master regulator of IL-22 production. Individuals carrying the aggravating T allele of rs2227473 produced significantly more IL-22 than those without this allele. Overall, these findings suggest that IL-22 is involved in the pathogenesis of CM.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Humans", "Interleukins", "Linkage Disequilibrium", "Malaria, Cerebral", "Malaria, Falciparum", "Male", "Nigeria", "Odds Ratio", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011284119", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6602996725": {"Name": "Marquet S.", "AuthorID": "6602996725", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille University, INSERM, GIMP, Labex ParaFrap"}, "6506993752": {"Name": "Argiro L.", "AuthorID": "6506993752", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille University, INSERM, GIMP, Labex ParaFrap"}, "6603074098": {"Name": "Dessein H.", "AuthorID": "6603074098", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille University, INSERM, GIMP, Labex ParaFrap"}, "57193276739": {"Name": "Couturier C.", "AuthorID": "57193276739", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille University, INSERM, GIMP, Labex ParaFrap"}, "7005572110": {"Name": "Dessein A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005572110", "AffiliationID": "60102127, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Aix-Marseille University, INSERM, GIMP, Labex ParaFrap"}, "55962000300": {"Name": "Conte I.", "AuthorID": "55962000300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering Sciences, University College London"}, "57193722596": {"Name": "Burt\u00e9 F.", "AuthorID": "57193722596", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering Sciences, University College London"}, "7003889849": {"Name": "Sodeinde O.", "AuthorID": "7003889849", "AffiliationID": "60018680, 60006270", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Malaria Research Group, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, University College Hospital"}, "8942330100": {"Name": "Fernandez-Reyes D.", "AuthorID": "8942330100", "AffiliationID": "60018680, 60006270", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Malaria Research Group, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, University College Hospital"}, "8709760400": {"Name": "Poudiougou B.", "AuthorID": "8709760400", "AffiliationID": "60071985", "AffiliationName": "Malaria Research and Training Center, Department of Epidemiology of Parasitic Disease, Faculty of Medicine, USTTB"}, "57208805552": {"Name": "Traore A.", "AuthorID": "57208805552", "AffiliationID": "60071985", "AffiliationName": "Malaria Research and Training Center, Department of Epidemiology of Parasitic Disease, Faculty of Medicine, USTTB"}, "7005026392": {"Name": "Doumbo O.", "AuthorID": "7005026392", "AffiliationID": "60071985", "AffiliationName": "Malaria Research and Training Center, Department of Epidemiology of Parasitic Disease, Faculty of Medicine, USTTB"}, "16022981700": {"Name": "Oumar A.A.", "AuthorID": "16022981700", "AffiliationID": "60071981", "AffiliationName": "Centre des Oeuvres Universitaires, University of Bamako"}, "25957585900": {"Name": "Brown B.J.", "AuthorID": "25957585900", "AffiliationID": "60018680, 60006270", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Malaria Research Group, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, University College Hospital"}, "55491278800": {"Name": "Afolabi N.K.", "AuthorID": "55491278800", "AffiliationID": "60018680, 60006270", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, University College Hospital"}, "6602393319": {"Name": "Omokhodion S.", "AuthorID": "6602393319", "AffiliationID": "60018680, 60006270", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Malaria Research Group, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, University College Hospital"}, "6701772805": {"Name": "Shokunbi W.A.", "AuthorID": "6701772805", "AffiliationID": "60018680, 60006270", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Malaria Research Group, College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, University College Hospital"}, "36909471200": {"Name": "Barry A.", "AuthorID": "36909471200", "AffiliationID": "112573098", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Wards, Gabriel Toure Hospital"}}}
