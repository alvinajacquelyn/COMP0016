The development of bone tissue engineering is directly related to changes in materials technology. While the inclusion of material requirements is standard in the design process of engineered bone substitutes, it is critical to incorporate clinical requirements in order to engineer a clinically relevant device. This review focuses on the potentials of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in trauma and orthopaedics and presents the need for bone tissue-engineered alternatives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioengineering", "Bone marrow derived stem cells", "Mesenchymal cells", "Orthopaedics", "Trauma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Marrow Cells", "Cell Differentiation", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Orthopedics", "Wounds and Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989266618", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"55467163500": {"Name": "Singh J.", "AuthorID": "55467163500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57191373377": {"Name": "Onimowo J.O.", "AuthorID": "57191373377", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "35229756200": {"Name": "Khan W.S.", "AuthorID": "35229756200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
