Two of these conjectures relate to the asymptotic growth of the first and second moments of the modular symbols. We prove these on average by using analytic properties of Eisenstein series twisted by modular symbols. Another of their conjectures predicts the Gaussian distribution of normalized modular symbols ordered according to the size of the denominator of the cusps. We prove this conjecture in a refined version that also allows restrictions on the location of the cusps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["11M36", "Primary 11F67", "Secondary 11E45"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040246881", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"6602285763": {"Name": "Petridis Y.N.", "AuthorID": "6602285763", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6507190163": {"Name": "Risager M.S.", "AuthorID": "6507190163", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}}}
