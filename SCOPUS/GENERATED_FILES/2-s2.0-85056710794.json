Mutations in GLRA2 are associated with autism spectrum disorder, but the underlying pathophysiology is not described yet. Here, using Glra2-knockout mice, we found a GlyR-dependent effect on neonatal spontaneous activity of dorsal striatum medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and maturation of the incoming glutamatergic innervation. Our data demonstrate that functional GlyRs are highly expressed in MSNs of one-week-old mice, but they do not generate endogenous chloride-mediated tonic or phasic current. Despite of that, knocking out the Glra2 severely affects the shape of action potentials and impairs spontaneous activity and the frequency of miniature AMPA receptor-mediated currents in MSNs. This reduction in spontaneous activity and glutamatergic signaling can attribute to the observed changes in neonatal behavioral phenotypes as seen in ultrasonic vocalizations and righting reflex. In adult Glra2-knockout animals, the glutamatergic synapses in MSNs remain functionally underdeveloped. The number of glutamatergic synapses and release probability at presynaptic site remain unaffected, but the amount of postsynaptic AMPA receptors is decreased. This deficit is a consequence of impaired development of the neuronal circuitry since acute inhibition of GlyRs by strychnine in adult MSNs does not affect the properties of glutamatergic synapses. Altogether, these results demonstrate that GlyR-mediated signaling supports neonatal spontaneous MSN activity and, in consequence, promotes the functional maturation of glutamatergic synapses on MSNs. The described mechanism might shed light on the pathophysiological mechanisms in GLRA2-linked autism spectrum disorder cases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism spectrum disorders", "Dorsal striatum", "Glycine receptors", "Medium spiny neurons", "Spontaneous activity", "Synaptic development"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056710794", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57200518156": {"Name": "Comhair J.", "AuthorID": "57200518156", "AffiliationID": "60010413", "AffiliationName": "BIOMED Research Institute, University of Hasselt"}, "7005388464": {"Name": "Schiffmann S.N.", "AuthorID": "7005388464", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurophysiology, ULB-Neuroscience Institute, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "35944306700": {"Name": "Gall D.", "AuthorID": "35944306700", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Physiology and Pharmacology, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"}, "8525836300": {"Name": "Molchanova S.M.", "AuthorID": "8525836300", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "University of Helsinki"}, "57204446552": {"Name": "Devoght J.", "AuthorID": "57204446552", "AffiliationID": "60010413", "AffiliationName": "BIOMED Research Institute, University of Hasselt"}, "56197018900": {"Name": "Morelli G.", "AuthorID": "56197018900", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and Brain Technologies, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "7103129150": {"Name": "Rigo J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103129150", "AffiliationID": "60010413", "AffiliationName": "BIOMED Research Institute, University of Hasselt"}, "7801343106": {"Name": "Br\u00f4ne B.", "AuthorID": "7801343106", "AffiliationID": "60010413", "AffiliationName": "BIOMED Research Institute, University of Hasselt"}, "57203196300": {"Name": "Harvey R.J.", "AuthorID": "57203196300", "AffiliationID": "60159369", "AffiliationName": "Sunshine Coast Health Institute"}, "35757431100": {"Name": "Briz V.", "AuthorID": "35757431100", "AffiliationID": "60019793", "AffiliationName": "VIB Center for the Biology of Disease"}, "34874508600": {"Name": "Borrie S.C.", "AuthorID": "34874508600", "AffiliationID": "60019793", "AffiliationName": "VIB Center for the Biology of Disease"}, "7003725750": {"Name": "Bagni C.", "AuthorID": "7003725750", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Fundamental Neurosciences, University of Lausanne"}}}
