Stimulus repetition at 1 Hz induces a strong habituation of the largest ERP responses, the vertex waves (VWs). VWs are elicited by stimuli regardless of their modality, provided that they are salient and behaviorally relevant. In contrast, the effect of stimulus repetition on the earlier sensory components of ERPs has been less explored, and the few existing results are inconsistent. To characterize how the different ERP waves habituate over time, we recorded the responses elicited by 60 identical somatosensory stimuli (activating either non-nociceptive A\u03b2 or nociceptive A\u03b4 afferents), delivered at 1 Hz to healthy human participants. We show that the well-described spatiotemporal sequence of lateralized and vertex ERP components elicited by the first stimulus of the series is largely preserved in the smaller-amplitude, habituated response elicited by the last stimuli of the series. We also found that the earlier lateralized sensory wave habituates across the 60 trials following the same decay function of the VWs: this decay function is characterized by a large drop at the first stimulus repetition followed by smaller decreases at subsequent repetitions. Interestingly, the same decay functions described the habituation of ERPs elicited by repeated non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli. This study provides a neurophysiological characterization of the effect of prolonged and repeated stimulation on the main components of somatosensory ERPs. It also demonstrates that both lateralized waves and VWs are obligatory components of ERPs elicited by non-nociceptive and nociceptive stimuli.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EEG", "ERP", "Habituation", "Nociception", "Somatosensory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials", "Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nociception", "Physical Stimulation", "Skin Physiological Phenomena", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054425812", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"35751408300": {"Name": "Mancini F.", "AuthorID": "35751408300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "8394280600": {"Name": "Bernacchia A.", "AuthorID": "8394280600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "55320364600": {"Name": "Pepe A.", "AuthorID": "55320364600", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Neuroscience, University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d"}, "37018232900": {"Name": "Di Stefano G.", "AuthorID": "37018232900", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Neuroscience, University of Rome \u201cLa Sapienza\u201d"}, "6602503125": {"Name": "Mouraux A.", "AuthorID": "6602503125", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}}}
