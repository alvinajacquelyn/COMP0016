A hierarchical Bayesian model is developed in the inverse problem setup. The Bayesian approach contains a natural mechanism for regularization in the form of a prior distribution, and a LASSO type prior distribution is used to strongly induce sparseness. We propose a variational type algorithm by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior distribution and a separable approximation. The proposed method is illustrated on several two-dimensional linear and nonlinear inverse problems, e.g. Cauchy problem and permeability estimation problem.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian inverse problems", "Hierarchical Bayesian model", "Kullback-Leibler divergence", "Variational approximation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941299719", "SubjectAreas": [["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55558876200": {"Name": "Guha N.", "AuthorID": "55558876200", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Texas A and M University"}, "12039192600": {"Name": "Efendiev Y.", "AuthorID": "12039192600", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A and M University"}, "56829716700": {"Name": "Wu X.", "AuthorID": "56829716700", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Texas A and M University"}, "7007042482": {"Name": "Mallick B.", "AuthorID": "7007042482", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, Texas A and M University"}, "8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
