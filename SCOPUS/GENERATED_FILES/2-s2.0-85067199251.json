In scenario-based experiments, we investigated whether different benefit\u2013harm ratios of RRM influence women\u2019s consideration of this, whether this consideration is influenced by women\u2019s perception of and desire to know their personal cancer risk, or by their intention to take a novel cancer risk-predictive test, and whether consideration varies across different countries. Method In January 2017, 1,675 women 40 to 75 years of age from five European countries\u2014Czech Republic, Germany, UK, Italy, and Sweden\u2014took part in an online scenario-based experiment. Six different scenarios of hypothetical benefit\u2013harm ratios of RRM were presented in accessible fact box formats: Baseline risk/risk reduction pairings were 20/16, 20/4, 10/8, 10/ 2, 5/4, and 5/1 out of 1,000 women dying from breast cancer. Results Varying the baseline risk of dying from breast cancer and the extent of risk reduction influenced the decision to consider RRM for 23% of women. Decisions varied by country, risk perception, and the intention to take a cancer risk-predictive test. Women who expressed a stronger intention to take such a test were more likely to consider having RRM. The desire to know one\u2019s risk of developing any female cancer in general moderated women\u2019s decisions, whereas the specific desire to know the risk of breast cancer did not. Conclusions In this hypothetical scenario-based study, only for a minority of women did the change in benefit\u2013harm ratio inform their consideration of RRM. Because this consideration is influenced by risk perception and the intention to learn one\u2019s cancer risks via a cancer risk-predictive test, careful disclosure of different potential preventive measures and their benefit\u2013harm ratios is necessary before testing for individual risk. Furthermore, information on risk testing should acknowledge country-specific sensitivities for benefit\u2013harm ratios.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Breast Neoplasms", "Czech Republic", "Decision Making", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Germany", "Humans", "Intention", "Italy", "Mastectomy", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Risk", "Risk Reduction Behavior", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Sweden", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067199251", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56580288300": {"Name": "Rebitschek F.G.", "AuthorID": "56580288300", "AffiliationID": "60122544, 60026562", "AffiliationName": "Harding Center for Risk Literacy, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "23398957000": {"Name": "Wegwarth O.", "AuthorID": "23398957000", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Center for Adaptive Rationality, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "57204528351": {"Name": "Pashayan N.", "AuthorID": "57204528351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Cancer, University College London"}}}
