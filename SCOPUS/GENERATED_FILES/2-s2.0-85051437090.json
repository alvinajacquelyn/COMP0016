We alternatively hypothesized that intraosseous changes are associated with the overlying port-wine stain rather than the intracranial stigmata of Sturge-Weber syndrome and hence are not a predictor of brain involvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR imaging of children presenting with port-wine stain and/or Sturge-Weber syndrome between 1998 and 2017 was evaluated by 2 pediatric neuroradiologists for marrow signal abnormality and pial angioma and other Sturge-Weber syndrome features: ocular hemangioma, atrophy, and white matter changes (advanced myelination). Groups were divided into port-wine stain- only (without intracranial Sturge-Weber syndrome features) and Sturge-Weber syndrome (the presence of cerebral pial angioma). The 2 test was performed to evaluate the association between port-wine stain and bone marrow changes and between osseous change and pial angioma. RESULTS: We reviewed 139 cases: 40 with port-wine stain- only and 99 with Sturge-Weber syndrome with pial angioma. Fifteen of 99 cases of Sturge-Weber syndrome had no port-wine stain. In the port-wine stain- only cohort, 78% had ipsilateral bony changes and 17% had no intraosseous changes. In the Sturge-Weber syndrome cohort, 84/99 had associated port-wine stain, 91% (P .01) had bony changes ipsilateral to the port-wine stain or had no bone changes in the absence of port-wine stain, and 77% (P .27) had bony changes ipsilateral to a cerebral pial angioma. Eighty percent of patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome who lacked a port-wine stain also lacked marrow changes. Five patients with bilateral port-wine stain and bilateral marrow changes had only a unilateral pial angioma. CONCLUSIONS: Intraosseous marrow changes are strongly associated with facial port-wine stain; no significant association was found between pial angioma and bone marrow changes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Marrow", "Brain", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Hemangioma", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Port-Wine Stain", "Skull", "Sturge-Weber Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051437090", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57203369044": {"Name": "Warne R.R.", "AuthorID": "57203369044", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neuroradiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57191920815": {"Name": "Carney O.M.", "AuthorID": "57191920815", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neuroradiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22956883800": {"Name": "Bhattacharya D.", "AuthorID": "22956883800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neuroradiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55981777900": {"Name": "Chong W.K.", "AuthorID": "55981777900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neuroradiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24390956300": {"Name": "Mankad K.", "AuthorID": "24390956300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, NHS Foundation Trust, Paediatric Neuroradiology"}, "6603729064": {"Name": "Aylett S.E.", "AuthorID": "6603729064", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and Developmental Neurosciences, University College London, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203372614": {"Name": "Wang G.", "AuthorID": "57203372614", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, University of Sydney, School of Public Health"}}}
