However, no population studies have systematically ascertained cognitive function before, cognitive deficits during, and cognitive impairment after delirium. Therefore, there is a need to address the following question: does delirium, and its features (including severity, duration, and presumed aetiologies), predict long-term cognitive impairment, independent of cognitive impairment at baseline? Methods: The Delirium and Population Health Informatics Cohort (DELPHIC) study is an observational population-based cohort study based in the London Borough of Camden. It is recruiting 2000 individuals aged \u226570 years and prospectively following them for two years, including daily ascertainment of all inpatient episodes for delirium. Daily inpatient assessments include the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, the Observational Scale for Level of Arousal, and the Hierarchical Assessment of Balance and Mobility. Data on delirium aetiology is also collected. The primary outcome is the change in the modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status at two years. Discussion: DELPHIC is the first population sample to assess older persons before, during and after hospitalisation. The cumulative incidence of delirium in the general population aged \u226570 will be described. DELPHIC offers the opportunity to quantify the impact of delirium on cognitive and functional outcomes. Overall, DELPHIC will provide a real-time public health observatory whereby information from primary, secondary, intermediate and social care can be integrated to understand how acute illness is linked to health and social care outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delirium", "Dementia", "Epidemiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Clinical Protocols", "Cognition", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Delirium", "Dementia", "Female", "Geriatric Assessment", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Incidence", "Inpatients", "London", "Male", "Population Health", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041829238", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"55350725000": {"Name": "Davis D.", "AuthorID": "55350725000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200603183": {"Name": "Hornby J.", "AuthorID": "57200603183", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57200599495": {"Name": "Bowden H.", "AuthorID": "57200599495", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57200602444": {"Name": "Hoffmann K.", "AuthorID": "57200602444", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57200608351": {"Name": "Weston-Clarke M.", "AuthorID": "57200608351", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57200595467": {"Name": "Green F.", "AuthorID": "57200595467", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "35412645300": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "35412645300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "8329745200": {"Name": "Kuh D.", "AuthorID": "8329745200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at UCL"}, "57016133900": {"Name": "Richardson S.", "AuthorID": "57016133900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University"}, "7005604974": {"Name": "Sampson E.", "AuthorID": "7005604974", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}, "57205741283": {"Name": "Mizoguchi R.", "AuthorID": "57205741283", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200597418": {"Name": "Cheah K.L.", "AuthorID": "57200597418", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200597073": {"Name": "Romain M.", "AuthorID": "57200597073", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57217754742": {"Name": "Sinha A.", "AuthorID": "57217754742", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24773422700": {"Name": "Jenkin R.", "AuthorID": "24773422700", "AffiliationID": "60171195", "AffiliationName": "Wye Valley NHS Trust"}, "57210386759": {"Name": "Brayne C.", "AuthorID": "57210386759", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "6603279159": {"Name": "MacLullich A.", "AuthorID": "6603279159", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}}}
