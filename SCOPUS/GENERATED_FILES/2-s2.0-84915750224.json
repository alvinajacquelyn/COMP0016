Published by Elsevier Inc.Objectives Estimation of between-study heterogeneity is problematic in small meta-analyses. Bayesian meta-analysis is beneficial because it allows incorporation of external evidence on heterogeneity. To facilitate this, we provide empirical evidence on the likely heterogeneity between studies in meta-analyses relating to specific research settings.Study Design and Setting Our analyses included 6,492 continuous-outcome meta-analyses within the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We investigated the influence of meta-analysis settings on heterogeneity by modeling study data from all meta-analyses on the standardized mean difference scale. Meta-analysis setting was described according to outcome type, intervention comparison type, and medical area. Predictive distributions for between-study variance expected in future meta-analyses were obtained, which can be used directly as informative priors.Results Among outcome types, heterogeneity was found to be lowest in meta-analyses of obstetric outcomes. Among intervention comparison types, heterogeneity was lowest in meta-analyses comparing two pharmacologic interventions. Predictive distributions are reported for different settings. In two example meta-analyses, incorporating external evidence led to a more precise heterogeneity estimate.Conclusion Heterogeneity was influenced by meta-analysis characteristics. Informative priors for between-study variance were derived for each specific setting. Our analyses thus assist the incorporation of realistic prior information into meta-analyses including few studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian analysis", "Continuous data", "Heterogeneity", "Intervention studies", "Meta-analysis", "Standardized mean difference"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Databases, Factual", "Female", "Humans", "Markov Chains", "Meta-Analysis as Topic", "Obstetrics", "Pregnancy", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84915750224", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"56354767100": {"Name": "Rhodes K.", "AuthorID": "56354767100", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge Institute of Public Health, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "7404556631": {"Name": "Turner R.", "AuthorID": "7404556631", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit, Cambridge Institute of Public Health, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}, "55616553600": {"Name": "Higgins J.", "AuthorID": "55616553600", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, Alcuin College, University of York"}}}
