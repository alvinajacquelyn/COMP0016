Herein, we show a facile strategy to significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of crystalline \u03b1-FeOOH by rapid heat treatment. We identify that crystalline \u03b1-FeOOH shows not only electrocatalytic activity as high as the benchmark FeOOH catalyst (amorphous \u03b3-FeOOH), but also the highest stability among all FeOOH electrocatalysts for the OER in alkaline solutions. Our findings not only deepen the fundamental understanding of the OER process on these materials but also guide further development of new low-cost electrocatalysts for energy storage via water splitting.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alkaline solutions", "Electrocatalytic activity", "Electrocatalytic activity and stability", "Low cost catalysts", "Low costs", "Oxygen evolution reaction", "Rapid heat treatment", "Water splitting"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011310908", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"36164313600": {"Name": "Luo W.", "AuthorID": "36164313600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "36652327500": {"Name": "Cheng Y.", "AuthorID": "36652327500", "AffiliationID": "60025441", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Flexible Electronics (KLOFE), Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Jiangsu National Synergetic Innovation Center for Advanced Materials (SICAM), Nanjing Tech University (NanjingTech)"}, "57199044991": {"Name": "Huang W.", "AuthorID": "57199044991", "AffiliationID": "60025441", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Flexible Electronics (KLOFE), Institute of Advanced Materials (IAM), Jiangsu National Synergetic Innovation Center for Advanced Materials (SICAM), Nanjing Tech University (NanjingTech)"}, "56329410000": {"Name": "Jiang C.", "AuthorID": "56329410000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404638641": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "7404638641", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55865504200": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55865504200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507489017": {"Name": "Shevlin S.A.", "AuthorID": "6507489017", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56328578400": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "56328578400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57201704542": {"Name": "Qiu K.", "AuthorID": "57201704542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
