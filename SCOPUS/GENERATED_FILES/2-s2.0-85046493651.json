We aimed to compare their effectiveness and to identify the most effective for the treatment of BN in adults.Methods A search was conducted in Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and Central from their inception to July 2016. Studies were included if they reported on treatments for adults who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for BN. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined available psychological, pharmacological, or combination therapies licensed in the UK were included. We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) of RCTs. The outcome analysed was full remission at the end of treatment.Results We identified 21 eligible trials with 1828 participants involving 12 treatments, including wait list. The results of the NMA suggested that individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (specific to eating disorders) was most effective in achieving remission at the end of treatment compared with wait list (OR 3.89, 95% CrI 1.19-14.02), followed by guided cognitive behavioural self-help (OR 3.81, 95% CrI 1.51-10.90). Inconsistency checks did not identify any significant inconsistency between the direct and indirect evidence.Conclusions The analysis suggested that the treatments that are most likely to achieve full remission are individual CBT (specific to eating disorders) and guided cognitive behavioural self-help, although no firm conclusions could be drawn due to the limited evidence base. There is a need for further research on the maintenance of treatment effects and the mediators of treatment outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bulimia nervosa", "eating disorder", "National Institute of Health and Care Excellence", "network meta-analysis", "outcome research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bulimia Nervosa", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Humans", "Network Meta-Analysis", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046493651", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57204026579": {"Name": "Slade E.", "AuthorID": "57204026579", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "National Guideline Alliance, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gyn\u00e6cologists"}, "12792514200": {"Name": "Mavranezouli I.", "AuthorID": "12792514200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "57204026369": {"Name": "Fou L.", "AuthorID": "57204026369", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "National Guideline Alliance, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gyn\u00e6cologists"}, "37113000000": {"Name": "Stockton S.", "AuthorID": "37113000000", "AffiliationID": "60113763", "AffiliationName": "National Guideline Alliance, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gyn\u00e6cologists"}, "57073027900": {"Name": "Saxon L.", "AuthorID": "57073027900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56647958200": {"Name": "Keeney E.", "AuthorID": "56647958200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "14832378300": {"Name": "Dias S.", "AuthorID": "14832378300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "7103248326": {"Name": "Waller G.", "AuthorID": "7103248326", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield"}, "7102188349": {"Name": "Turner H.", "AuthorID": "7102188349", "AffiliationID": "60162122", "AffiliationName": "Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust, April House"}, "55747914900": {"Name": "Serpell L.", "AuthorID": "55747914900", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Eating Disorder Service, North East London Foundation NHS Trust, Porters Avenue Health Centre"}, "7006603343": {"Name": "Fairburn C.G.", "AuthorID": "7006603343", "AffiliationID": "60000940, 60002634", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital"}, "7006779060": {"Name": "Kendall T.", "AuthorID": "7006779060", "AffiliationID": "60026447", "AffiliationName": "National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, Royal College of Psychiatrists"}}}
