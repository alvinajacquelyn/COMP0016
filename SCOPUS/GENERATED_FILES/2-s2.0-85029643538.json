Design: Experimental image analysis study. Study Objects: Three 3-dimensional printed model eyes simulating eyes with axial lengths of 22, 24, and 26 mm. Each model has a grid of rings 9\u00b0 apart centered at the posterior pole. Methods: Single-center study performed at the National Institute for Health Research Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre (London, UK). Each model was imaged using Optos 200TX (Optos, Dunfermline, UK). Two images for each model eye that were corrected using V2 Vantage Pro software (Optos) were used for analysis and the average values obtained. Each image inter-ring area was measured using ImageJ to obtain a measured image area in pixel and square millimeters. This was compared with the true calculated object inter-ring area and an enlargement factor was determined. Main Outcome Measures: Measured image inter-ring area in pixels and square millimeters. True calculated object inter-ring area in square millimeters. Results: The enlargement factor of the rings gradually increases toward the periphery with factors of 1.4 at 45\u00b0 and 1.9 at the equator. The axial lengths did not affect the enlargement factor of the rings imaged in 3 different model eyes (P = 0.9512). The anterior equator exhibits a significant distortion despite the software correction. Conclusion: The enlargement factor depends on angular location and not axial length. The enlargement factors can be used in clinical practice to more accurately measure area in ultra-widefield imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029643538", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36128742800": {"Name": "Nicholson L.", "AuthorID": "36128742800", "AffiliationID": "60007904", "AffiliationName": "Western Sussex National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "57004950600": {"Name": "Vazquez-Alfageme C.", "AuthorID": "57004950600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57184418300": {"Name": "Clemo M.", "AuthorID": "57184418300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57221209618": {"Name": "Luo Y.", "AuthorID": "57221209618", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003429874": {"Name": "Hykin P.G.", "AuthorID": "7003429874", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7005169657": {"Name": "Bainbridge J.W.", "AuthorID": "7005169657", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital and University College London Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
