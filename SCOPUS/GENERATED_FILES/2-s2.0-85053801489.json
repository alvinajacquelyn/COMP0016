The problem is highly nonlinear, characterized by four nonlinearities and two separate diffusive terms, all acting in the interior of the domain or on its boundary. Through a suitable approximation of the problem based on abstract theory of doubly nonlinear evolution equations, existence and uniqueness of solutions are proved using compactness and monotonicity arguments. The asymptotic behaviour of the solutions as the diffusion operator on the boundary vanishes is also shown.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cahn\u2013Hilliard system", "Dynamic boundary conditions", "Existence of solutions", "Nonlinear viscosity", "Uniqueness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053801489", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57056210800": {"Name": "Scarpa L.", "AuthorID": "57056210800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
