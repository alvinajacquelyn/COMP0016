Whilst scientific research provides evidence to replace, reduce and refine procedures involving laboratory animals (the '3Rs'), work in the humanities and social sciences can help understand the social, economic and cultural processes that enhance or impede humane ways of knowing and working with laboratory animals. However, communication across these disciplinary perspectives is currently limited, and they design research programmes, generate results, engage users, and seek to influence policy in different ways. To facilitate dialogue and future research at this interface, we convened an interdisciplinary group of 45 life scientists, social scientists, humanities scholars, non-governmental organisations and policy-makers to generate a collaborative research agenda. This drew on methods employed by other agenda-setting exercises in science policy, using a collaborative and deliberative approach for the identification of research priorities. Participants were recruited from across the community, invited to submit research questions and vote on their priorities. They then met at an interactive workshop in the UK, discussed all 136 questions submitted, and collectively defined the 30 most important issues for the group. The output is a collaborative future agenda for research in the humanities and social sciences on laboratory animal science and welfare. The questions indicate a demand for new research in the humanities and social sciences to inform emerging discussions and priorities on the governance and practice of laboratory animal research, including on issues around: international harmonisation, openness and public engagement, 'cultures of care', harm-benefit analysis and the future of the 3Rs. The process outlined below underlines the value of interdisciplinary exchange for improving communication across different research cultures and identifies ways of enhancing the effectiveness of future research at the interface between the humanities, social sciences, science and science policy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Welfare", "Animals", "Cooperative Behavior", "Humanities", "Humans", "Interdisciplinary Studies", "Laboratory Animal Science", "Social Sciences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979573585", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7402854601": {"Name": "Davies G.F.", "AuthorID": "7402854601", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "7102395107": {"Name": "Buller H.", "AuthorID": "7102395107", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "12809089600": {"Name": "Greenhough B.J.", "AuthorID": "12809089600", "AffiliationID": "60115348, 60175816", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography and the Environment, Keble College, University of Oxford"}, "6508248482": {"Name": "Hobson-West P.", "AuthorID": "6508248482", "AffiliationID": "60024834, 60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Bioethics, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham"}, "24603406700": {"Name": "Kirk R.G.W.", "AuthorID": "24603406700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the History of Science, Technology and Medicine (CHSTM), Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "35765239000": {"Name": "Applebee K.", "AuthorID": "35765239000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biological Services, Health Schools, King's College London"}, "16041300300": {"Name": "Bellingan L.C.", "AuthorID": "16041300300", "AffiliationID": "60112296", "AffiliationName": "Society of Biology, Charles Darwin House"}, "57190380219": {"Name": "Diefenbacher D.", "AuthorID": "57190380219", "AffiliationID": "60112296", "AffiliationName": "Society of Biology, Charles Darwin House"}, "6602820835": {"Name": "Berdoy M.", "AuthorID": "6602820835", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Services, University of Oxford"}, "6603997447": {"Name": "Cassaday H.J.", "AuthorID": "6603997447", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "57190380394": {"Name": "Davies K.", "AuthorID": "57190380394", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Joint Biological Services, College of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "56147493400": {"Name": "Druglitr\u00f8 T.", "AuthorID": "56147493400", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "TIK -
