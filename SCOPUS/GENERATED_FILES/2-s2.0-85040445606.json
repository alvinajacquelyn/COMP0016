The intersection of these bodies of literature is in the often overlooked defining features of megalopolitan forms \u2013 their being the \u2018hub\u2019 that links national to international urban systems and the \u2018incubator\u2019 within national urban systems (Gottmann, 1976). With this intersection in mind, this paper measures the functional polycentricity of China\u2019s Yangtze River Delta Region (YRDR) at different geographical scales from an intercity knowledge collaboration perspective. The paper uses data on co-publications as an indicator of knowledge linkages between cities within and beyond this megalopolis. The YRDR can be seen as functionally polycentric at the megapolitan scale but this functional polycentricity decreases with increases in the geographical scale at which interurban linkages are considered. Furthermore, a multi-scalar analysis of functional polycentricity helps identify the hub role of Shanghai. The results show that Shanghai\u2019s knowledge hub role is currently present at the national scale. It may take some time for Shanghai to become a knowledge hub at the global scale given its not-so-strong international links and relatively weak local links. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future research agendas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["functional polycentricity", "knowledge collaboration", "megalopolis", "urban networks", "Yangtze River Delta Region"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040445606", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"57008940000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57008940000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "57203076068": {"Name": "Phelps N.", "AuthorID": "57203076068", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
