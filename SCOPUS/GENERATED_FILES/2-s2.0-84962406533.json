Location, dimension of the object and its position in the public space are only a few of the elements that contribute to creating an engaging experience for passers-by. This paper describes the implementation and evaluation of a responsive installation that simulates a breathing-like behaviour depending on the proximity of passers-by. Placing the installation in different locations across the UCL campus (University College of London, UK) permitted to run systematic observations and, hence, outline basic categories of people behaviour. A higher number of interactions was registered when: 1) the Breathing Display was easy to reach by hand while walking by; 2) somebody was already interacting with the display; 3) the display was set to move in relation to the users' proximity (i.e. closer triggers more intensive movement by the display). These findings may be beneficial to other designers who are creating and implementing public display applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interactivity", "Public displays", "Spatial configurations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962406533", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"]], "AuthorData": {"57188702748": {"Name": "Miccoli G.", "AuthorID": "57188702748", "AffiliationID": "60111771", "AffiliationName": "Foster + Partners"}, "57188699948": {"Name": "Bakogianni A.", "AuthorID": "57188699948", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett, UCL"}, "55841045800": {"Name": "Fatah Gen Schieck A.", "AuthorID": "55841045800", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett, UCL"}}}
