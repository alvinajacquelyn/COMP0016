It currently affects approximately 30% of adults and 10% of children and adolescents. The resulting increase in the number of patients with NAFLD is expected to translate into increased numbers of patients with liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this context, it is particularly important to identify patients at risk for progressive chronic liver disease. Currently, liver biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to establish the presence and stage of fibrosis. Due to the remarkable increase in the prevalence of NAFLD and the concomitant efforts in developing novel therapies for patients with NASH, non-invasive, simple, reproducible, and reliable noninvasive methodologies are needed. This paper provides a concise overview of the role of non-invasive diagnostic tools for the determination of presence and extent of fibrosis in NAFLD patients, with particular emphasis on the methods currently available in clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fibrosis", "NAFLD", "NASH", "Non-invasive"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-67650558987", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"23493813300": {"Name": "Vizzutti F.", "AuthorID": "23493813300", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "7005935080": {"Name": "Arena U.", "AuthorID": "7005935080", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "7004704315": {"Name": "Tarquini R.", "AuthorID": "7004704315", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "8916065700": {"Name": "Trappoliere M.", "AuthorID": "8916065700", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "7005172544": {"Name": "Laffi G.", "AuthorID": "7005172544", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, University of Florence"}, "55405948300": {"Name": "Marra F.", "AuthorID": "55405948300", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Center for Research, Higher Education and Transfer DENOThe, University of Florence"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "100324288", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Medicina Interna"}, "13806750500": {"Name": "Nobili V.", "AuthorID": "13806750500", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children's Hospital and Research Institute"}}}
