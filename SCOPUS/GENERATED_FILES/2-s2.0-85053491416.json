All Rights Reserved.This paper reports the first structural application of site-cast, alkali-activated slag concrete in China. Special attention was given in this office building project at Chongqing Jianke to quality control, construction procedure and assessment. The experience showed that quality and costs could be successfully managed through careful control of raw materials, suitable selection of admixtures, proper mix proportions and an efficient construction team. It was also found that alkali-activated slag concrete has the potential for use in cold weather. The ambient temperature during construction was at times below 5\u00b0C, yet no specific procedures were needed to maintain the temperature or provide additional heat. The project is a useful reference for future structural use of alkali-activated slag concrete.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Concrete structures", "Materials technology", "Quality control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkali-activated slag concretes", "Building projects", "Cold weather", "Construction procedures", "Efficient construction", "Materials technology", "Mix proportions", "Structural applications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053491416", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"56970113600": {"Name": "Yang K.", "AuthorID": "56970113600", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}, "8231310800": {"Name": "Yang C.", "AuthorID": "8231310800", "AffiliationID": "60023380", "AffiliationName": "College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University"}, "57129067500": {"Name": "Yu L.", "AuthorID": "57129067500", "AffiliationID": "60023380", "AffiliationName": "College of Materials Science and Engineering, Chongqing University"}, "57203914827": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57203914827", "AffiliationID": "108199292", "AffiliationName": "Chongqing Construction Science Research Institute"}, "26432817500": {"Name": "Pan Q.", "AuthorID": "26432817500", "AffiliationID": "108199292", "AffiliationName": "Chongqing Construction Science Research Institute"}, "55461062100": {"Name": "Bai Y.", "AuthorID": "55461062100", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, Faculty of Engineering Science, UCL"}}}
