Understanding the factors that drive parasite host-generalism is of basic biological interest, but also directly relevant to predicting disease emergence in new host species, identifying parasites that are likely to have unidentified additional hosts, and assessing transmission risk. Here, we use mathematical models to investigate how variation in host body size and environmental temperature affect the evolution of parasite host-generalism. We predict that parasites are more likely to evolve a generalist strategy when hosts are large-bodied, when variation in host body size is large, and in cooler environments. We then explore these predictions using a newly updated database of over 20 000 fish-macroparasite associations. Within the database we see some evidence supporting these predictions, but also highlight mismatches between theory and data. By combining these two approaches, we establish a theoretical basis for interpreting empirical data on parasites\u2019 host specificity and identify key areas for future work that will help untangle the drivers of parasite host-generalism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fish parasites", "Host range", "Invasion analysis", "Specialism", "Transmission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Body Size", "Fishes", "Host Specificity", "Host-Parasite Interactions", "Models, Biological", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015216566", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55511229800": {"Name": "Walker J.G.", "AuthorID": "55511229800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "14822154600": {"Name": "Hurford A.", "AuthorID": "14822154600", "AffiliationID": "60019000", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Memorial University of Newfoundland"}, "7005219307": {"Name": "Cable J.", "AuthorID": "7005219307", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "53877114000": {"Name": "Ellison A.R.", "AuthorID": "53877114000", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "56432110300": {"Name": "Price S.J.", "AuthorID": "56432110300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute"}, "36343318600": {"Name": "Cressler C.E.", "AuthorID": "36343318600", "AffiliationID": "60012709, 60026306", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Nebraska-Lincoln"}}}
