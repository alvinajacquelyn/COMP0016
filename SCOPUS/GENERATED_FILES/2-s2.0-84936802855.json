Probing the nature of the molecular species at the atomic level has led to the identification of a unique Co-O-Ti bond, which serves as the loci for the superior performance of the bimetallic catalyst, when compared with its analogous monometallic counterpart. The structural and spectroscopic features associated with this active site have been characterized and contrasted, with a view to affording structure-property relationships, in the wider context of designing sustainable catalytic oxidations with porous solids.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aluminophosphates", "Atomic levels", "Bimetallic catalysts", "Molecular species", "Nano-porous", "Porous solids", "Spectroscopic features", "Structure property relationships"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936802855", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"37067996100": {"Name": "Potter M.", "AuthorID": "37067996100", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "57194326861": {"Name": "Paterson A.", "AuthorID": "57194326861", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "7102964814": {"Name": "Raja R.", "AuthorID": "7102964814", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "8358783500": {"Name": "Mishra B.", "AuthorID": "8358783500", "AffiliationID": "60002873", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, Illinois Institute of Technology"}, "7401618579": {"Name": "Kelly S.", "AuthorID": "7401618579", "AffiliationID": "60099032", "AffiliationName": "UOP LLC, A Honeywell Company"}, "7004026217": {"Name": "Bare S.", "AuthorID": "7004026217", "AffiliationID": "60099032", "AffiliationName": "UOP LLC, A Honeywell Company"}, "55944154200": {"Name": "Cor\u00e0 F.", "AuthorID": "55944154200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56110135100": {"Name": "Levy A.", "AuthorID": "56110135100", "AffiliationID": "60032995", "AffiliationName": "Honeywell International"}}}
