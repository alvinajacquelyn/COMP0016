Using first-principles density functional theory simulations we investigate the interfacial stability of MgO//Mg interfaces, and find that a combination of interfacial chemical bonding energy and epitaxial strain stored in the oxide layers can change the relative stability of competing MgO//Mg interfaces. We propose that a combination of the oxygen chemical potential at the interface plane and the epitaxial strain energy stored in the oxide layers is responsible for the differences in observed interfacial crystal orientations\u2013a key insight for the design and development of Mg alloys reinforced by MgO particles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Density functional theory", "Interfacial free energy", "Interfacial stability", "MgO//Mg interface"], "IndexKeywords": ["Density functional theory studies", "Design and Development", "First-principles density functional theory", "Interface planes", "Interfacial chemicals", "Interfacial free energy", "Interfacial stabilities", "Relative stabilities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978934470", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7404429179": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "7404429179", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "7004620955": {"Name": "Horsfield A.", "AuthorID": "7004620955", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "56771430300": {"Name": "Wearing D.", "AuthorID": "56771430300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}}}
