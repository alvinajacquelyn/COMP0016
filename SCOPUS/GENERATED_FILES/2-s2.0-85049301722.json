In vitro polymerized F-actin can be used as a synthetic ligand for DNGR-1. However, cellular F-actin is decorated with actin-binding proteins, which could affect DNGR-1 recognition. Here, we demonstrate that myosin II, an F-actin-associated motor protein, greatly potentiates the binding of DNGR-1 to F-actin. Latex beads coated with F-actin and myosin II are taken up by DNGR-1+ cDC1s, and antigen associated with those beads is efficiently cross-presented to CD8+ T cells. Myosin II-deficient necrotic cells are impaired in their ability to stimulate DNGR-1 or to serve as substrates for cDC1 cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells. These results provide insights into the nature of the DNGR-1 ligand and have implications for understanding immune responses to cell-associated antigens and for vaccine design.Schulz et al. show that dead cells lacking myosin II have a diminished capacity to serve as antigen donors for dendritic cells that express the DNGR-1 receptor. DNGR-1 binds to F-actin exposed on cell corpses, and myosin II organizes actin filaments into bundles that cross-link the receptor more efficiently.", "AuthorKeywords": ["actin", "actin-binding proteins", "C-type lectin", "CLEC9A", "dendritic cells", "DNGR-1", "myosin II"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actins", "Animals", "Antigens", "Cell Death", "Cell Line", "Cross-Priming", "Immunization", "Lectins, C-Type", "Melanoma, Experimental", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myosin Heavy Chains", "Myosin Type II", "Phagocytosis", "Protein Binding", "Receptors, Immunologic", "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049301722", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7006637364": {"Name": "Schulz O.", "AuthorID": "7006637364", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "55164728400": {"Name": "Han\u010d P.", "AuthorID": "55164728400", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunobiology, Harvard Medical School"}, "56730242900": {"Name": "B\u00f6ttcher J.P.", "AuthorID": "56730242900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7004608060": {"Name": "Reis e Sousa C.", "AuthorID": "7004608060", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Immunobiology Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "36473574800": {"Name": "Hoogeboom R.", "AuthorID": "36473574800", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haemato-Oncology, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "6603645423": {"Name": "Tolar P.", "AuthorID": "6603645423", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology and Inflammation, Imperial College London"}, "6603782636": {"Name": "Diebold S.S.", "AuthorID": "6603782636", "AffiliationID": "60000365", "AffiliationName": "Biotherapeutics Division, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control"}}}
