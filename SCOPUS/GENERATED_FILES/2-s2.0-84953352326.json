This operator contains first order diverging terms caused by the divergence of the volume. We get explicit descriptions of the spectrum and the eigenfunctions. In particular in both cases we get a Weyl's law with leading term Elog E. We then study the drastic effect of Aharonov-Bohm magnetic potentials on the spectral properties. Other generalized Riemannian structures including conic and anti-conic type manifolds are also studied. In this case, the Aharonov-Bohm magnetic potential may affect the self-adjointness of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aharonov-Bohm effect", "almost-Riemannian geometry", "counting function", "embedded eigenvalues", "Laplace-Beltrami operator", "spectral accumulation", "sub-Riemannian geometry", "Weyl's law"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953352326", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"6701764545": {"Name": "Boscain U.", "AuthorID": "6701764545", "AffiliationID": "60105988", "AffiliationName": "Team GECO, INRIA Saclay"}, "56624319800": {"Name": "Prandi D.", "AuthorID": "56624319800", "AffiliationID": "60008924, 60105735", "AffiliationName": "CEREMADE, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Dauphine"}, "36167084600": {"Name": "Seri M.", "AuthorID": "36167084600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
