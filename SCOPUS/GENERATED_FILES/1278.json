Method We used data from a record-linkage cohort study of 158,679 children aged 12-24 years at the end of follow-up, resident in Stockholm County from 2001 to 2007, to investigate whether different parental mental illnesses are risk factors for eating disorders in their offspring. The outcome measure was diagnosis of any eating disorder, either from an ICD or DSM-IV code, or inferred from an appointment at a specialist eating disorder clinic. Results Mental illness in parents is a risk factor for eating disorders in female offspring (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR) 1.57 (95% CI 1.42, 1.92), p < 0.0001). Risk of eating disorders is increased if there is a parental diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder (AHR 2.28 (95% CI 1.39, 3.72), p = 0.004), personality disorder (AHR 1.57 (95% CI 1.01, 2.44), p = 0.043) or anxiety/depression (AHR 1.57 (95% CI 1.32, 1.86), p < 0.0001). There is a lack of statistical evidence for an association with parental schizophrenia (AHR 1.41 (95% CI 0.96, 2.07), p = 0.08), and somatoform disorder (AHR 1.25 (95% CI 0.74, 2.13), p = 0.40). There is no support for a relationship between parental substance misuse and eating disorders in children (AHR 1.08 (95% CI 0.82, 1.43), p = 0.57). Discussion Parental mental illness, specifically parental anxiety, depression, bipolar affective disorder, and personality disorders, are risk factors for eating disorders in their offspring.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anorexia nervosa", "bulimia nervosa", "child", "eating disorders", "EDNOS", "mental illness", "parent"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anxiety Disorders", "Bipolar Disorder", "Child", "Child of Impaired Parents", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Depressive Disorder", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Parent-Child Relations", "Parents", "Personality Disorders", "Risk Factors", "Schizophrenia", "Sweden", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927912853", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36975240400": {"Name": "Bould H.", "AuthorID": "36975240400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Mental Health, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "8932321000": {"Name": "Koupil I.", "AuthorID": "8932321000", "AffiliationID": "60028378, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Equity Studies, Stockholm University, Karolinska Institute"}, "6701846593": {"Name": "Dalman C.", "AuthorID": "6701846593", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Division of Epidemiology, Karolinska Institute"}, "7006321127": {"Name": "Magnusson C.", "AuthorID": "7006321127", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Sciences, Division of Epidemiology, Karolinska Institute"}, "55665447800": {"Name": "Destavola B.", "AuthorID": "55665447800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
