Research has shown that checking e-mails out-of-hours via computer makes workers feel more overloaded with work but also increases their sense of coping. A total of 94 participants completed a survey exploring whether the same pattern would emerge for accessing e-mail on smartphones, showing that those who use smartphones for work e-mail experienced lower levels of overload, but not coping, and push notifications were associated with greater use of smartphones for e-mail. However, there were no significant correlations between coping or overload and e-mail use or quantity, suggesting that lower overload is not due to the ability to processes or read more e-mails outside of work.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coping", "Overload", "Smartphones", "Stress", "Work e-mail"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coping", "E-mail use", "Overload", "Work life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945199397", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"23491319900": {"Name": "Collins E.I.M.", "AuthorID": "23491319900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.L.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre"}, "56921536800": {"Name": "Wootton R.", "AuthorID": "56921536800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Interaction Centre"}}}
