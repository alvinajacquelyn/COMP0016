Our study aimed to develop a statistically valid model for the complete time course of DCE-MRI data in a patient cohort.Materials and Methods: Data from 10 patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases were analyzed, including two baseline scans and four post-bevacizumab scans. Apparent changes in tumor median Ktrans were adjusted for changes in observed enhancing tumor fraction (EnF) by multiplying Ktrans by EnF (KEnF). A mixed-effects model (MEM) was defined to describe the KEnF time course for all patients simultaneously by assuming a three-parameter indirect response model with model parameters lognormally distributed across patients.Results: The typical cohort time course showed a KEnF reduction to 59% of baseline at 24 hours, returning to 65% of baseline values by day 12. Interpatient variability of model parameters ranged from 11% to 307%.Conclusion: The MEM approach has potential for comparing responses at a group level in clinical trials with different doses, schedules, or combination regimens. Furthermore, the KEnF biomarker successfully resolved confounds in interpreting Ktrans arising from therapy induced changes in the volume of enhancing tumor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bevacizumab", "Biomarker", "Colorectal liver metastases", "DCE-MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Bevacizumab", "Cohort Studies", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Gadolinium DTPA", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Liver", "Liver Neoplasms", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918798239", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"8041855500": {"Name": "Ferl G.Z.", "AuthorID": "8041855500", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics, Genentech, Inc."}, "7005898170": {"Name": "Port R.E.", "AuthorID": "7005898170", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics, Genentech, Inc."}, "55771778500": {"Name": "O'Connor J.P.B.", "AuthorID": "55771778500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Imaging Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "24766914700": {"Name": "Parker G.J.M.", "AuthorID": "24766914700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Imaging Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "6701757446": {"Name": "Carano R.A.D.", "AuthorID": "6701757446", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Imaging Department, Genentech, Inc."}, "55951776900": {"Name": "Acharya S.J.", "AuthorID": "55951776900", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, University of California"}, "7003823468": {"Name": "Jayson G.C.", "AuthorID": "7003823468", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Christie Hospital"}}}
