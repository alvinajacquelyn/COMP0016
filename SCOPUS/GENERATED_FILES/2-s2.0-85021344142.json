The rheological properties, anti-settlement stability, and redispersibility are the very important properties of MR fluids. In this paper, a kind of preparation process of MR fluids is introduced and MR fluids with different grain diameter ratios of carbonyl iron particles are produced. Then, the properties of self-prepared MR fluids are tested, including the sedimentation stability test, viscosity test, and shear yield stress test. The results of the MR fluid property tests show that the adding of 10 fim-carbonyl iron particles will improve the magnetic effect of MR fluids, increase the zero magnetic field viscosity of MR fluids, and increase shear yield stress of MR fluids in same magnetic field, but the anti-settlement properties will be degraded.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbonyl iron particles", "Different grain diameter", "Magneto-rheological", "Preparation process", "Rheological property", "Sedimentation stability", "Vibration mitigation", "Zero magnetic fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021344142", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56975631100": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "56975631100", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical and Electronic Engineering College, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "55286952400": {"Name": "Guo W.", "AuthorID": "55286952400", "AffiliationID": "60025665", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical and Electronic Engineering College, Nanjing Forestry University"}, "56173438500": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "56173438500", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of C and PC Structures of Ministry of Education, Southeast University"}, "56460534000": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "56460534000", "AffiliationID": "60084616", "AffiliationName": "Sichuan Provincial Architectural Design and Research Institute"}, "34973241800": {"Name": "Ran C.", "AuthorID": "34973241800", "AffiliationID": "116471242", "AffiliationName": "Nanjing Dongrui Damping Control Technology Co, Ltd"}}}
