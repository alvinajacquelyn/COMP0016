The motions are forced by regular incident waves, for a range of wave amplitudes and frequencies. One disk has a barrier attached to its edge to stop the incident waves from washing across its upper surface. It is shown that the motions of the disk without the barrier are smaller than those of the disk with the barrier. Moreover, it is shown that the amplitudes of the motions, relative to the incident amplitude, decrease with increasing incident wave amplitude for the disk without a barrier and for short incident wavelengths. Two theoretical models of the disk motions are considered. One is based on slope-sliding theory and the other on combined linear potential-flow and thin-plate theories. The models are shown to have almost the same form in the long-wavelength regime. The potential-flow/thin-plate model is shown to capture the experimentally measured disk motions with reasonable accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Marine geophysics", "Ocean waves", "Sea ice"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hydrodynamic response", "Incident wavelength", "Linear potential", "Long wavelength", "Marine geophysics", "Reasonable accuracy", "Thin plate theory", "Wave amplitudes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954166704", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"56698387200": {"Name": "Yiew L.", "AuthorID": "56698387200", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "19933696800": {"Name": "Bennetts L.", "AuthorID": "19933696800", "AffiliationID": "60009512", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Adelaide"}, "7006094962": {"Name": "Meylan M.", "AuthorID": "7006094962", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Physical Science, University of Newcastle"}, "36154336700": {"Name": "French B.", "AuthorID": "36154336700", "AffiliationID": "60007015", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Maritime Engineering and Hydrodynamics, Australian Maritime College"}, "25925551300": {"Name": "Thomas G.", "AuthorID": "25925551300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
