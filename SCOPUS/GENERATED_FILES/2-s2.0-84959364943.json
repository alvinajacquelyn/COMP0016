Semantic analysis, which is an important one of them, aims to label points as different categories. In machine learning, the problem is called classification. In addition, processing point data is becoming more and more challenging due to the growing data volume. In this paper, we address point data classification in a big data context. The popular cluster computing framework Apache Spark is used through the experiments and the promising results suggests a great potential of Apache Spark for large-scale point data processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big data", "Cloud computing", "Machine learning", "Point cloud"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computing frameworks", "Data contexts", "Geospatial applications", "Label points", "Point cloud", "Point cloud data", "Processing points", "Semantic analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959364943", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"56539060900": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "56539060900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Civil, Environ Geomatic Eng, University College"}, "57147072600": {"Name": "Boehm J.", "AuthorID": "57147072600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept of Civil, Environ Geomatic Eng, University College"}}}
