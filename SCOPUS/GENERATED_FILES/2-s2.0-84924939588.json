All rights reserved.Objective: We prospectively determined islet autoantibody status in children presenting with diabetes to a single UK region in relation to ethnicity. Design: 316 (68.0% non-white) children presenting with diabetes between 2006 and 2013 were tested centrally for islet cell autoantibodies (ICA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GAD-65) at diagnosis, and if negative for both, tested for insulin autoantibodies (IAA). The assay used to measure GAD-65 autoantibodies changed from an in-house to a standardised ELISA method during the study. Results: Even with use of the standardised ELISA method, 25.8% of children assigned a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes still tested negative for all three autoantibodies. 30% of children assigned a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were autoantibody positive, and these had the highest glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels at 12 months follow-up compared with other groups (p value for analysis of variance <0.001), although the sample size was small. Autoantibody positivity was similar between non-white and white children regardless of assay used (60.0% (n=129) vs 56.4% (n=57), \u03c7<sup>2</sup>=0.9, p=0.35), as was mean GAD-65 autoantibody levels, but fewer non-white children had two or more autoantibodies detectable (13% (n=28) vs 27.7% (n=28), \u03b3<sup>2</sup>=12.1, p=0.001). Conclusions: Islet autoantibody positivity was associated with a more severe phenotype, as demonstrated by poorer glycaemic control, regardless of assigned diabetes subtype. Positivity did not differ by ethnic group.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Analysis of Variance", "Autoantibodies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Islets of Langerhans", "Male", "Phenotype", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924939588", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56464170300": {"Name": "Perchard R.", "AuthorID": "56464170300", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Queens Hospital"}, "56463978400": {"Name": "Say J.", "AuthorID": "56463978400", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Royal London Hospital"}, "6603806999": {"Name": "Allgrove J.", "AuthorID": "6603806999", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Royal London Hospital"}, "56463583300": {"Name": "Pitts J.", "AuthorID": "56463583300", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Queens Hospital"}, "57213378045": {"Name": "Banerjee K.", "AuthorID": "57213378045", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Queens Hospital"}, "56555834800": {"Name": "MacDonald D.", "AuthorID": "56555834800", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Royal London Hospital"}, "56556292800": {"Name": "Pye S.", "AuthorID": "56556292800", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Royal London Hospital"}, "7103022678": {"Name": "Amin R.", "AuthorID": "7103022678", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
