Recent studies have sought to investigate differences in white matter microstructure in AN, with significant results in several brain regions. A systematic literature search of Embase, PubMed and Psychinfo databases was conducted in order to identify Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies of patients with AN and controls. We performed a meta-analysis of studies that met our inclusion criteria (N = 13) using effect size-signed differential mapping (AES-SDM) to detect differences in Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in patients with AN (N = 227) compared to healthy controls (N = 243). The quantitative meta-analysis of DTI studies identified decreased FA in the posterior areas of the corpus callosum, the left superior longitudinal fasciculus II, and the left precentral gyrus, as well as increased FA in the right cortico-spinal projections, and lingual gyrus in AN vs. controls. Studies of WM architecture are still limited in AN; further studies with longitudinal design are needed to better understand the complexity of abnormalities, and their persistence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorexia nervosa", "Diffusion imaging", "DTI", "Eating disorders", "MRI", "White matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropy", "Anorexia Nervosa", "Brain", "Corpus Callosum", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063098741", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56803731300": {"Name": "Barona M.", "AuthorID": "56803731300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Geneva"}, "57197409605": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "57197409605", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "7004549374": {"Name": "Frangou S.", "AuthorID": "7004549374", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "55628581092": {"Name": "White T.", "AuthorID": "55628581092", "AffiliationID": "60015627", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry/Psychology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital"}}}
