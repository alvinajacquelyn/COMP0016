However, the resolution of climate data could be affecting the accuracy of climate change impact assessments. Here, we review the spatial and temporal resolution of climate data used in impact assessments and demonstrate that these resolutions are often too coarse relative to biologically relevant scales. We then develop a framework that partitions climate into three important components: trend, variance, and autocorrelation. We apply this framework to map different global climate regimes and identify where coarse climate data is most and least likely to reduce the accuracy of impact assessments. We show that impact assessments for many large mammals and birds use climate data with a spatial resolution similar to the biologically relevant area encompassing population dynamics. Conversely, impact assessments for many small mammals, herpetofauna, and plants use climate data with a spatial resolution that is orders of magnitude larger than the area encompassing population dynamics. Most impact assessments also use climate data with a coarse temporal resolution. We suggest that climate data with a coarse spatial resolution is likely to reduce the accuracy of impact assessments the most in climates with high spatial trend and variance (e.g., much of western North and South America) and the least in climates with low spatial trend and variance (e.g., the Great Plains of the USA). Climate data with a coarse temporal resolution is likely to reduce the accuracy of impact assessments the most in the northern half of the northern hemisphere where temporal climatic variance is high. Our framework provides one way to identify where improving the resolution of climate data will have the largest impact on the accuracy of biological predictions under climate change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autocorrelation", "grid size", "impact assessment", "spatial resolution", "spatial scaling", "temporal resolution", "trend", "variance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Birds", "Climate", "Climate Change", "Forecasting", "Population Dynamics", "South America"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990227066", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"25029445100": {"Name": "Nadeau C.", "AuthorID": "25029445100", "AffiliationID": "60022659", "AffiliationName": "Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department, University of Connecticut"}, "8612363700": {"Name": "Urban M.", "AuthorID": "8612363700", "AffiliationID": "60022659", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biological Risk, University of Connecticut"}, "7004251123": {"Name": "Bridle J.", "AuthorID": "7004251123", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol"}}}
