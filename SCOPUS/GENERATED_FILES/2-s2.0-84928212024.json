Published by Taylor & Francis.There is robust evidence that childhood circumstances are related to quality of life in older ages, but the role of possible intermediate factors is less explored. In this paper, we examine to what extent associations between deprived childhood circumstances and quality of life at older ages are due to experienced labour market disadvantage during adulthood. Analyses are based on the Survey of Health Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), with detailed retrospective information on individual life courses collected among 10,272 retired men and women in 13 European countries (2008-2009). Our assumption is that those who have spent their childhood in deprived circumstances may also have had more labour market disadvantage with negative consequences for quality of life beyond working life. Results demonstrate that advantaged circumstances during childhood are associated with lower levels of labour market disadvantage and higher quality of life in older ages. Furthermore, results of multivariate analyses support the idea that part of the association between childhood circumstances and later quality of life is explained by labour market disadvantage during adulthood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CASP", "labour market disadvantage", "life course"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Child", "Employment", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Life Change Events", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Retirement", "Retrospective Studies", "Sex Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928212024", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"14013424200": {"Name": "Wahrendorf M.", "AuthorID": "14013424200", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health and Society, Institute for Medical Sociology, University of D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "57195814716": {"Name": "Blane D.", "AuthorID": "57195814716", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, International Centre for Life Course Studies in Society and Health, University College London"}}}
