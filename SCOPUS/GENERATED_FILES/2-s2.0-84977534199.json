To quickly and efficiently plan for maintenance requirements, OEMs require accurate information about the use and wear of their products. In recent decades, the aerospace industry in particular has become expert in using real time data for the purpose of product monitoring and maintenance scheduling. Significant quantities of real time usage data from product monitoring are commonly generated and transmitted back to the OEMs, where diagnostic and prognostic analysis will be carried out. More recently, other industries such as construction and automotive, are also starting to develop capabilities in these areas and condition based maintenance (CBM) is increasing in popularity as a means of satisfying customers\u2019 demands. CBM requires constant monitoring of real time product data by the OEMs, however the biggest challenge for these industries, in particular construction, is the lack of accurate and real time understanding of how their products are being used possibly because of the complex supply chains which exist in construction projects. This research focuses on current dynamic data acquisition techniques for mobile hydraulic systems, in this case the use of a mobile inline particle contamination sensor; the aim was to assess suitability to achieve both diagnostic and prognostic requirements of Condition Based Maintenance. It concludes that hydraulic oil contamination analysis, namely detection of metallic particulates, offers a reliable way to measure real time wear of hydraulic components.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Construction equipment", "Diagnostic", "Hydraulic oil contamination", "Particle sensors", "Prognostic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Condition-based maintenance", "Diagnostic", "Hydraulic oil", "Maintenance requirement", "Mobile hydraulic systems", "Original equipment manufacturers", "Particle sensors", "Prognostic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977534199", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56715077600": {"Name": "Ng F.", "AuthorID": "56715077600", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "55548993500": {"Name": "Harding J.A.", "AuthorID": "55548993500", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson School of Manufacturing and Mechanical Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "8291208300": {"Name": "Glass J.", "AuthorID": "8291208300", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil and Building Engineering, Loughborough University"}}}
