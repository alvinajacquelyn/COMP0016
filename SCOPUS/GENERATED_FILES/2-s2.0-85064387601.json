The technical and scientific challenges in doing this are far greater than they seem at first and are compounded by a lack of approved standards for assays used to support (c)GMP manufacture. This paper highlights some of those challenges and proposes solutions based on the experience of our colleagues using similar assay platforms in regulated pathology laboratories.", "AuthorKeywords": ["in-process QC", "quality assurance", "Quality control", "release assays"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological Assay", "Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy", "Chromosomal Instability", "DNA Fingerprinting", "Drug Approval", "Flow Cytometry", "Genetic Therapy", "Graft vs Host Disease", "Hematologic Tests", "Histocompatibility Testing", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "International Cooperation", "Laboratories", "Quality Control", "Terminology as Topic", "Transplantation, Homologous"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064387601", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"56612263400": {"Name": "Weil B.", "AuthorID": "56612263400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell, Gene & Tissue Therapeutics, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35077527600": {"Name": "Hanley P.J.", "AuthorID": "35077527600", "AffiliationID": "60005007, 60003088, 60005723", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cancer and Immunology Research, Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Children's Research Institute, Children's National Medical Center and The George Washington University"}}}
