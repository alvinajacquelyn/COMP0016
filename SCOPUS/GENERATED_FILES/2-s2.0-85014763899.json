Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.We discuss new Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopic observations of four luminous galaxies at z \u2243 7-9 selected to have intense optical line emission by Roberts-Borsani et al. Previous followup has revealed Ly\u03b1 in two of the four galaxies. Our new MOSFIRE observations confirm that Ly\u03b1 is present in the entire sample. We detect Ly\u03b1 emission in the galaxy COS-zs7-1, confirming its redshift as zLy\u03b1 = 7.154, and we detect Ly\u03b1 in EGS-zs8-2 at zLy\u03b1 = 7.477, verifying an earlier tentative detection. The ubiquity of Ly\u03b1 in this sample is puzzling given that the IGM is expected to be significantly neutral over 7 < z < 9. To investigate this result in more detail, we have initiated a campaign to target UV metal lines in the four Ly\u03b1 emitters as a probe of both the ionizing field and the Ly\u03b1 velocity offset at early times. Here we present the detection of C III] emission in the z = 7.73 galaxy EGS-zs8-1, requiring an intense radiation field and moderately low metallicity. We argue that the radiation field is likely to affect the local environment, increasing the transmission of Ly\u03b1 through the galaxy.Moreover, the centroid of CIII] indicates that Ly\u03b1 is redshifted by 340 km s-1. This velocity offset is larger than that seen in less luminous systems, providing an explanation for the transmission of Ly\u03b1 emission through the IGM. Since the transmission is further enhanced by the likelihood that such systems are also situated in large ionized bubbles, the visibility of Ly\u03b1 at z > 7 is expected to be strongly luminosity-dependent, with transmission accelerated in systems with intense star formation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: observations", "Galaxies: evolution", "Galaxies: formation", "Galaxies: high-redshift"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014763899", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"12242554300": {"Name": "Stark D.P.", "AuthorID": "12242554300", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "57189895474": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "57189895474", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "57189888055": {"Name": "Mainali R.", "AuthorID": "57189888055", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Steward Observatory, University of Arizona"}, "7401985303": {"Name": "Ellis R.S.", "AuthorID": "7401985303", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203258248": {"Name": "Charlot S.", "AuthorID": "57203258248", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60015201, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC-CNRS, UMR7095, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris"}, "55947750400": {"Name": "Gutkin J.", "AuthorID": "55947750400", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60015201, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC-CNRS, UMR7095, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris"}, "56941897700": {"Name": "Vidal-Garc\u00eda A.", "AuthorID": "56941897700", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60015201, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s, UPMC-CNRS, UMR7095, Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris"}, "52263322100": {"Name": "Chevallard J.", "AuthorID": "52263322100", "AffiliationID": "60031159", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Support Office, Directorate of Science and Robotic Exploration, ESA/ESTEC"}, "45360925900": {"Name": "Belli S.", "AuthorID": "45360925900", "AffiliationID": "60021561", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut fur extraterrestrische Physik"}, "25032212900": {"Name": "Zitrin A.", "AuthorID": "25032212900", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology"}, "6701327987": {"Name": "Bouwens R.", "AuthorID": "6701327987", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}, "23968339900": {"Name": "Oesch P.", "AuthorID": "23968339900", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Yale Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Yale University"}}}
