In this paper we review the existing literature on one type of wearable-smartwatches-and extend their definition, in addition to highlighting the need to understand users' everyday appropriation of these technologies. We present initial findings from an on going interview study with ten early adopters that is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate why and how people use smartwatches in real life. We describe everyday use of smartwatches, highlight the added value seen by users, and identify the limitations to mass adoption as expressed by current users.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mobile computers", "Smartphone", "Smartwatch", "Wearable computing", "Wearable devices", "Wrist-worn devices"], "IndexKeywords": ["Mobile computers", "Smartwatch", "Wearable computing", "Wearable devices", "Wrist-worn devices"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954271415", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55851220100": {"Name": "Cecchinato M.E.", "AuthorID": "55851220100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.L.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "57209025408": {"Name": "Bird J.", "AuthorID": "57209025408", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University London"}}}
