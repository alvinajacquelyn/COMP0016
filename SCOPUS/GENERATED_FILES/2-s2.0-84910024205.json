Design/Methods: Ten patients took part in three semi-structured in-depth interviews prior to (week 0), midway (week 3), and at completion (week 6) of the exercise program. Data were analysed using a phenomenological approach. Results: Main themes that were deemed important for remaining enrolled in the program included: (1) building camaraderie and peer support, (2) experiencing a sense of structure and control, and (3) feeling safe and encouraged. Patients also reported engaging in further exercise outside the program and feeling motivated to continue exercising in the future. Conclusions: This study shows the potential to integrate exercise prior to surgery as it was viewed as acceptable and feasible by patients with advanced rectal cancer. Moreover, it provides much needed information into the possible mechanisms that underpin patient's continued participation in exercise programs during treatment for advanced rectal cancer. Prescribed, hospital-based program should be implemented to promote opportunities for exercise and provide on-going supportive care options for patients awaiting surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Motivation", "Physical activity", "Psychosocial oncology", "Qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84910024205", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"55255971500": {"Name": "Burke S.M.", "AuthorID": "55255971500", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biological Sciences, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "36144796600": {"Name": "West M.A.", "AuthorID": "36144796600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, Department of Musculoskeletal Biology II, University of Liverpool"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.W.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Integrative Physiology and Critical Illness Group, Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "8099726400": {"Name": "Jack S.", "AuthorID": "8099726400", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Critical Care Research Area, NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25923801500": {"Name": "Brunet J.", "AuthorID": "25923801500", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, School of Human Kinetics, University of Ottawa"}}}
