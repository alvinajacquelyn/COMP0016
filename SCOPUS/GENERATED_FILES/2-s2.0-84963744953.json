To optimize therapy outcome, virtual rehabilitation systems automatically adapt to the different patients' changing needs. Adaptation decisions should ideally be guided by both the observable performance and the hidden mind state of the user. We hypothesize that some affective aspects can be inferred from observable metrics. Here we present preliminary results of a classification exercise to decide on 4 states; tiredness, tension, pain and satisfaction. Descriptors of 3D hand movement and finger pressure were collected from 2 post-stroke participants while they practice on a virtual rehabilitation platform. Linear Support Vector Machine models were learnt to unfold a predictive relation between observation and the affective states considered. Initial results are promising (ROC Area under the curve (mean\u00b1std): 0.713 \u00b1 0.137). Confirmation of these opens the door to incorporate surrogates of mind state into the algorithm deciding on therapy adaptation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affective computing", "hand", "motor recovery", "stroke", "virtual rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Affective Computing", "hand", "Motor recovery", "stroke", "Virtual rehabilitation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963744953", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56519318700": {"Name": "Rivas J.", "AuthorID": "56519318700", "AffiliationID": "60030699", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00edsica, \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica (INAOE)"}, "22986331300": {"Name": "Orihuela-Espina F.", "AuthorID": "22986331300", "AffiliationID": "60030699", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00edsica, \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica (INAOE)"}, "8312922300": {"Name": "Sucar L.", "AuthorID": "8312922300", "AffiliationID": "60030699", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00edsica, \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica (INAOE)"}, "55650784000": {"Name": "Palafox L.", "AuthorID": "55650784000", "AffiliationID": "60000029", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Department, Instituto Nacional de Neurologi\u00e1 y Neurocirugi\u00e1 (INNN), Ciudad de M\u00e9xico"}, "15020479500": {"Name": "Hernandez-Franco J.", "AuthorID": "15020479500", "AffiliationID": "60000029", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation and Physical Medicine Department, Instituto Nacional de Neurologi\u00e1 y Neurocirugi\u00e1 (INNN), Ciudad de M\u00e9xico"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Bianchi-Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College of London (UCL)"}}}
