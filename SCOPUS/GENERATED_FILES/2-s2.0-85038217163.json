If individual layers have nodes that are mildly correlated, the multiplex network is best synchronizable when the mirror degrees are strongly negatively correlated. If individual layers have nodes with strong degree-degree correlations, mild correlations among the degrees of mirror nodes are the best strategy for the optimization of GS. Global synchronization also depend on the density of connections, a phenomenon not observed in a single layer network. The results are crucial to understand, predict, and specify behavior of systems having multiple types of connections among the interacting units.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Degree-degree correlations", "Global synchronization", "Multiplex networks", "Node correlations", "Single layer", "Synchronizability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038217163", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56660072300": {"Name": "Kumar A.", "AuthorID": "56660072300", "AffiliationID": "60104350", "AffiliationName": "Complex Systems Laboratory, Discipline of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Indore"}, "56152342900": {"Name": "Jalan S.", "AuthorID": "56152342900", "AffiliationID": "60104350", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Bio-Science and Bio-Medical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore"}, "7102934062": {"Name": "Baptista M.S.", "AuthorID": "7102934062", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Complex Systems and Mathematical Biology, SUPA, University of Aberdeen"}, "7103103296": {"Name": "Zaikin A.", "AuthorID": "7103103296", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod"}}}
