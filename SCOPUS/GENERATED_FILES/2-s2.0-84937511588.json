During virus entry, capsid shells are primed and disassembled in a complex, tightly-regulated, multi-step process termed uncoating. Here we compare the uncoating-programs of DNA viruses of the pox-, herpes-, adeno-, polyoma-, and papillomavirus families. Highlighting the chemical and mechanical cues virus capsids respond to, we review the conformational changes that occur during stepwise disassembly of virus capsids and how these culminate in the release of viral genomes at the right time and cellular location to assure successful replication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capsid priming", "Endocytosis", "Fusion", "Viral genome release", "Virus entry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capsid Proteins", "DNA Viruses", "DNA, Viral", "Virus Uncoating"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937511588", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"36550493300": {"Name": "Kilcher S.", "AuthorID": "36550493300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC-Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "14121881600": {"Name": "Mercer J.", "AuthorID": "14121881600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC-Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
