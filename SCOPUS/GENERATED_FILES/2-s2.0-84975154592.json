Here, we show that T-bet acts through enhancers to allow the recruitment of Mediator and P-TEFb in the form of the super elongation complex (SEC). Th1 genes are occupied by H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II in Th2 cells, while T-bet-mediated recruitment of P-TEFb in Th1 cells activates transcriptional elongation. P-TEFb is recruited to both genes and enhancers, where it activates enhancer RNA transcription. P-TEFb inhibition and Mediator and SEC knockdown selectively block activation of T-bet target genes, and P-TEFb inhibition abrogates Th1-associated experimental autoimmune uveitis. T-bet activity is independent of changes in NF-\u03baB RelA and Brd4 binding, with T-bet- and NF-\u03baB-mediated pathways instead converging to allow P-TEFb recruitment. These data provide insight into the mechanism through which lineage-specifying factors promote differentiation of alternative T cell fates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nuclear Proteins", "Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B", "Protein Binding", "RNA", "T-Box Domain Proteins", "Th1 Cells", "Th2 Cells", "Transcription Elongation, Genetic", "Transcription Factor RelA", "Transcription Factors", "Uveitis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975154592", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"24390236700": {"Name": "Hertweck A.", "AuthorID": "24390236700", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520, 60171763", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunobiology, NIHR Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital and King's College London"}, "56899209300": {"Name": "Evans C.M.", "AuthorID": "56899209300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57189758504": {"Name": "Lau J.C.H.", "AuthorID": "57189758504", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55509322800": {"Name": "Oleinika K.", "AuthorID": "55509322800", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57189761734": {"Name": "Ambrose J.", "AuthorID": "57189761734", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7004044168": {"Name": "Jenner R.G.", "AuthorID": "7004044168", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7201902828": {"Name": "Jackson I.", "AuthorID": "7201902828", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520, 60171763", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunobiology, NIHR Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital and King's College London"}, "7006574717": {"Name": "Lord G.M.", "AuthorID": "7006574717", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520, 60171763", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Immunobiology, NIHR Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre, Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital and King's College London"}, "6507269761": {"Name": "Eskandarpour M.", "AuthorID": "6507269761", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7102593758": {"Name": "Adamson P.", "AuthorID": "7102593758", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7003742122": {"Name": "Calder V.L.", "AuthorID": "7003742122", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "8578899300": {"Name": "Kelly A.", "AuthorID": "8578899300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Asthma, Allergy, and Respiratory Science, King's College London"}, "7006039639": {"Name": "Cousins D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006039639", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Leicester Institute for Lung Health, Department of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, NIHR Leicester Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, University of Leicester"}, "57194440761": {"Name": "Lavender P.", "AuthorID": "57194440761", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Asthma, Allergy, and Respiratory Science, King's College London"}}}
