Specific predictors explain only a small proportion of these differences. To meaningfully predict who will respond to which antidepressant, it may be necessary to combine multiple biomarkers and clinical variables. Using statistical learning on common genetic variants and clinical information in a training sample of 280 individuals randomly allocated to 12-week treatment with antidepressants escitalopram or nortriptyline, we derived models to predict remission with each antidepressant drug. We tested the reproducibility of each prediction in a validation set of 150 participants not used in model derivation. An elastic net logistic model based on eleven genetic and six clinical variables predicted remission with escitalopram in the validation dataset with area under the curve 0.77 (95%CI; 0.66-0.88; p = 0.004), explaining approximately 30% of variance in who achieves remission. A model derived from 20 genetic variables predicted remission with nortriptyline in the validation dataset with an area under the curve 0.77 (95%CI; 0.65-0.90; p < 0.001), explaining approximately 36% of variance in who achieves remission. The predictive models were antidepressant drug-specific. Validated drug-specific predictions suggest that a relatively small number of genetic and clinical variables can help select treatment between escitalopram and nortriptyline.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation", "Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic", "Biomarkers", "Citalopram", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nortriptyline", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044976298", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"12446011400": {"Name": "Iniesta R.", "AuthorID": "12446011400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London"}, "56962718400": {"Name": "Stahl D.", "AuthorID": "56962718400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics and Health Informatics Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Kings College London"}, "55257500600": {"Name": "Hodgson K.", "AuthorID": "55257500600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "36552816800": {"Name": "Malki K.", "AuthorID": "36552816800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7003415672": {"Name": "Aitchison K.J.", "AuthorID": "7003415672", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Medical Genetics, University of Alberta"}, "7102158824": {"Name": "Farmer A.", "AuthorID": "7102158824", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57203252012": {"Name": "McGuffin P.", "AuthorID": "57203252012", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7402975073": {"Name": "Lewis C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402975073", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57201919550": {"Name": "Uher R.", "AuthorID": "57201919550", "AffiliationID": "60023750", "AffiliationName": "Dalhousie University, Department of Psychiatry"}, "36046783700": {"Name": "Maier W.", "AuthorID": "36046783700", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Bonn"}, "16741658400": {"Name": "Rietschel M.", "AuthorID": "16741658400", "AffiliationID": "60005285", "AffiliationName": "Central Institute of Mental Health, Division of Genetic Epidemiology in Psychiatry"}, "7004006411": {"Name": "Mors O.", "AuthorID": "7004006411", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Research Department P, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "7202945962": {"Name": "Hauser J.", "AuthorID": "7202945962", "AffiliationID": "60069010", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Psychiatric Genetics, Department of Psychiatry, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Collegium Maius"}, "55933046400": {"Name": "Henigsberg N.", "AuthorID": "55933046400", "AffiliationID": "60006461, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Croatian Institute for Brain Research, Medical School, University of Zagreb"}, "6602737481": {"Name": "Dernovsek M.Z.", "AuthorID": "6602737481", "AffiliationID": "60021802", "AffiliationName": "Universitiy of Ljubljana, Medical Faculty"}, "7003619771": {"Name": "Souery D.", "AuthorID": "7003619771", "AffiliationID": "60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Psychologie M\u00e9dicale, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles and Psy Pluriel, Centre Europ\u00e9en de Psychologie M\u00e9dicale"}}}
