Epidermal grafting (EG) enables epidermal transfer to wounds with minimal donor site morbidity. However, data to date have been heterogeneous. This study aims to synthesise the current evidence on EG for wound healing to establish the efficacy of this surgical technique. A comprehensive search in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases was conducted. The endpoints assessed were proportion of wounds healed and mean wound-healing time. This systematic review was conducted and reported according to the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. We identified 1568 articles, of which seven articles were included in this review \u2013 a total of 209 wounds in 190 patients. The mean wound duration was 17\u00b706 weeks (95% CI 8\u00b757\u201325\u00b755). Of these, 71\u00b75% (95% CI 56\u00b77\u201384\u00b72) of the wounds achieved complete healing. Mean time for complete wound healing was 5\u00b753 weeks (95% CI 3\u00b718\u20137\u00b788). The mean donor site healing time was 7\u00b748 days (95% CI 4\u00b783\u201310\u00b713), with no reported donor site morbidity. The current data are small and lack level 1 evidence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidermal graft", "Skin graft", "Systematic review", "Wound healing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Epidermis", "Humans", "Skin Transplantation", "Transplantation, Autologous", "Wound Healing", "Wounds and Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013683127", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"56427994500": {"Name": "Kanapathy M.", "AuthorID": "56427994500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "London Wound Healing Group, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "55985666400": {"Name": "Mosahebi A.", "AuthorID": "55985666400", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "London Wound Healing Group, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "56427569500": {"Name": "Richards T.", "AuthorID": "56427569500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "London Wound Healing Group, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "54881691700": {"Name": "Smith O.J.", "AuthorID": "54881691700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "London Wound Healing Group, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "54390971700": {"Name": "Hachach-Haram N.", "AuthorID": "54390971700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "London Wound Healing Group, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "54405633700": {"Name": "Bystrzonowski N.", "AuthorID": "54405633700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "London Wound Healing Group, Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}}}
