Although interfacial misfit arrays offer a possibility of growing strain-free GaSb-based devices on GaAs substrates, a high density of threading dislocations is normally observed. Here, we present the effects of the combined influence of Be dopants and low growth temperature on the threading dislocation density observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. The Be-related hardening mechanism, occurring at island coalescence, is shown to prevent dislocations to glide and hence reduce the threading dislocation density in these structures. The threading density in the doped GaSb layers reaches the values of seven times less than those observed in undoped samples, which confirms the proposed Be-related hardening mechanism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Hardening mechanism", "Interfacial misfit arrays", "Low growth temperature", "Plastic relaxation", "Solid solution strengthening", "Thermophotovoltaic applications", "Threading dislocation", "Threading dislocation densities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012976859", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35240020700": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez M.", "AuthorID": "35240020700", "AffiliationID": "60016476", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science and Metallurgic Engineering, University of Cadiz"}, "7005138382": {"Name": "Araujo D.", "AuthorID": "7005138382", "AffiliationID": "60016476", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science and Metallurgic Engineering, University of Cadiz"}, "56897244300": {"Name": "Jurczak P.", "AuthorID": "56897244300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
