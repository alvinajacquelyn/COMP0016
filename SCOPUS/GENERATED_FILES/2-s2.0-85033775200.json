There has been little systematic examination of erythrocytes, a rich source of \u03b1-synuclein. Methods: Erythrocyte membranes were obtained from PD patients (mutation carriers in the \u03b1-synuclein gene (A53T-PD) and glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA-PD) (n = 18 each), and patients without known mutations (GU-PD, n = 56)), and age-/sex-matched controls (n = 56). Levels of monomeric and dimeric \u03b1-synuclein were assessed using Western immunoblotting. Results: A statistically significant increase of \u03b1-synuclein dimer and dimer to monomer ratio was found in GBA-PD and GU-PD. In contrast, dimer levels of A53T-PD were not different from controls. No difference was found in \u03b1-synuclein monomer levels. Conclusions: The increased \u03b1-synuclein dimer in GBA-PD and GU-PD is suggestive of an apparent systemic dysfunction causing the dimerization, and potentially oligomerization, of \u03b1-synuclein. These results may have implications for PD pathogenesis and biomarker development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha-synuclein", "Alpha-synuclein dimers", "Alpha-synuclein oligomers", "Erythrocytes", "Glucocerebrosidase", "Red blood cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "alpha-Synuclein", "Dimerization", "Erythrocytes", "Female", "Glucosylceramidase", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033775200", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57188849793": {"Name": "Papagiannakis N.", "AuthorID": "57188849793", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "12790281200": {"Name": "Maniati M.", "AuthorID": "12790281200", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "24076091000": {"Name": "Dermentzaki G.", "AuthorID": "24076091000", "AffiliationID": "60003185", "AffiliationName": "Center of Clinical Research, Experimental Surgery and Translational Research, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens"}, "57202963715": {"Name": "Stefanis L.", "AuthorID": "57202963715", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "15834998200": {"Name": "Koros C.", "AuthorID": "15834998200", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56575103000": {"Name": "Simitsi A.", "AuthorID": "56575103000", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "42261006800": {"Name": "Antonelou R.", "AuthorID": "42261006800", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900, 60015528", "AffiliationName": "2nd Department of Neurology, Attikon Hospital, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "56430631100": {"Name": "Papadimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "56430631100", "AffiliationID": "121599012", "AffiliationName": "\u201cHenry Dynan\u201d Hospital"}, "6603497576": {"Name": "Moraitou M.", "AuthorID": "6603497576", "AffiliationID": "108938507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Enzymology and Cellular Function, Institute of Child Health"}, "7003963499": {"Name": "Michelakakis H.", "AuthorID": "7003963499", "AffiliationID": "108938507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Enzymology and Cellular Function, Institute of Child Health"}}}
