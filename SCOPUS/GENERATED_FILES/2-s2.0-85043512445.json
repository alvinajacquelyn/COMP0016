Analyses were carried out of 134 mothers with symptoms of PND randomised into 10 weeks of group singing workshops or group play workshops for them and their babies, or usual care (trial registration: NCT02526407). Overall, among all mothers with symptoms of PND, there was a nonsignificant faster improvement in symptoms in the singing group (F4,262 = 1.66, P = 0.16, ?2 = 0.012). When isolating mothers with moderate-severe symptoms of PND, this result became significant, with a faster improvement in symptoms in the singing group (F3.9,139.8 = 2.74, P = 0.033, ?2 = 0.028).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Depression, Postpartum", "Female", "Humans", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Psychotherapy, Group", "Sensory Art Therapies", "Singing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043512445", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55911947100": {"Name": "Fancourt D.", "AuthorID": "55911947100", "AffiliationID": "60113750, 60175882", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Performance Science, Royal College of Music"}, "55602471100": {"Name": "Perkins R.", "AuthorID": "55602471100", "AffiliationID": "60113750, 60175882", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Performance Science, Royal College of Music"}}}
