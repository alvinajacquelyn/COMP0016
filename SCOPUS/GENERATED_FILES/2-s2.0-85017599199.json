This communication between somatic and germ cells promotes the accumulation, inside the oocyte, of maternal RNAs, proteins and other molecules that will sustain the two gamete divisions and early embryo development up to its implantation. In order to preserve their stock of maternal products, oocytes from all species divide twice minimizing the volume of their daughter cells to their own benefit. For this, they undergo asymmetric divisions in size where one main objective is to locate the division spindle with its chromosomes off-centred. In this chapter, we will review how this main objective is reached with an emphasis on the role of actin microfilaments in this process in mouse oocytes, the most studied example in mammals. This chapter is subdivided into three parts: I-General features of asymmetric divisions in mouse oocytes, IIMechanism of chromosome positioning by actin in mouse oocytes and III-Switch from asymmetric to symmetric division at the oocyte-to-embryo transition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actin Cytoskeleton", "Animals", "Asymmetric Cell Division", "Female", "Mice", "Oocytes", "Oogenesis", "Zygote"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017599199", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55081566900": {"Name": "Chaigne A.", "AuthorID": "55081566900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, UCL"}, "6507861320": {"Name": "Terret M.", "AuthorID": "6507861320", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60010578, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "CIRB, Coll\u00e8ge de France, CNRS-UMR7241 INSERM-U1050"}, "6701477546": {"Name": "Verlhac M.", "AuthorID": "6701477546", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60010578, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "CIRB, Coll\u00e8ge de France, CNRS-UMR7241 INSERM-U1050"}}}
