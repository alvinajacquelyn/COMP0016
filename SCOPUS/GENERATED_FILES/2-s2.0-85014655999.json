KGaA, WeinheimNovel 3D Ni1\u2212 xCoxSe2 mesoporous nanosheet networks with tunable stoichiometry are successfully synthesized on Ni foam (Ni1\u2212 xCoxSe2 MNSN/NF with x ranging from 0 to 0.35). The collective effects of special morphological design and electronic structure engineering enable the integrated electrocatalyst to have very high activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excellent stability in a wide pH range. Ni0.89Co0.11Se2 MNSN/NF is revealed to exhibit an overpotential (\u03b710) of 85 mV at \u221210 mA cm\u22122 in alkaline medium (pH 14) and \u03b710 of 52 mV in acidic solution (pH 0), which are the best among all selenide-based electrocatalysts reported thus far. In particular, it is shown for the first time that the catalyst can work efficiently in neutral solution (pH 7) with a record \u03b710 of 82 mV for all noble metal-free electrocatalysts ever reported. Based on theoretical calculations, it is further verified that the advanced all-pH HER activity of Ni0.89Co0.11Se2 is originated from the enhanced adsorption of both H+ and H2O induced by the substitutional doping of cobalt at an optimal level. It is believed that the present work provides a valuable route for the design and synthesis of inexpensive and efficient all-pH HER electrocatalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["all-pH electrolysis", "electrocatalysts", "electronic structure regulation", "hydrogen evolution", "nickel\u2013cobalt diselenide"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diselenide", "Enhanced adsorptions", "Hydrogen evolution", "Hydrogen evolution reactions", "Metal-free electrocatalysts", "Morphological design", "Structure engineering", "Theoretical calculations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014655999", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57208649094": {"Name": "Liu B.", "AuthorID": "57208649094", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "56150320000": {"Name": "Zhang Z.Y.", "AuthorID": "56150320000", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "57193533391": {"Name": "Sit C.K.", "AuthorID": "57193533391", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "54882046300": {"Name": "Yuen M.F.", "AuthorID": "54882046300", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "16464316100": {"Name": "Lee C.S.", "AuthorID": "16464316100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "37070726100": {"Name": "Zhang W.J.", "AuthorID": "37070726100", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Center of Super-Diamond and Advanced Films (COSDAF), Department of Physics and Materials Science, City University of Hong Kong"}, "55154571900": {"Name": "Zhao Y.F.", "AuthorID": "55154571900", "AffiliationID": "60026311, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "17436570200": {"Name": "Zhang T.R.", "AuthorID": "17436570200", "AffiliationID": "60026311, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Technical Institute of Physics and Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7402232270": {"Name": "Peng H.Q.", "AuthorID": "7402232270", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute for Advanced Study, Institute of Molecular Functional Materials and Division of Biomedical Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}}}
