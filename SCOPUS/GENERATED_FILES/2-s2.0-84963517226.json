Participants (N = 14,760), members of the Twins Early Development Study, were assessed on their ability to draw a human figure, including number of features, symmetry, and proportionality. Human figure drawing was moderately stable across 6 months (average r = .40). Individual differences in drawing at age 41/2 were influenced by genetic (.21), shared environmental (.30), and nonshared environmental (.49) factors. Drawing was related to later (age 12) mathematical ability (average r = .24). This association was explained by genetic and shared environmental factors that also influenced general intelligence. Some genetic factors, unrelated to intelligence, also contributed to individual differences in drawing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aptitude", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Individuality", "Intelligence", "Male", "Mathematical Concepts", "Motor Skills"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963517226", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57188808291": {"Name": "Malanchini M.", "AuthorID": "57188808291", "AffiliationID": "60016896", "AffiliationName": "Tomsk State University"}, "56393026500": {"Name": "Dirik A.", "AuthorID": "56393026500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Unit for Social and Community Psychiatry, WHO Collaborating Centre for Mental Health Services Development, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57188818754": {"Name": "Czerwik A.", "AuthorID": "57188818754", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Goldsmiths University of London"}, "8680670800": {"Name": "Kovas Y.", "AuthorID": "8680670800", "AffiliationID": "60108380", "AffiliationName": "New York University in London"}, "55949025500": {"Name": "Tosto M.G.", "AuthorID": "55949025500", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "University of York"}, "56414855500": {"Name": "Garfield V.", "AuthorID": "56414855500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "25653875300": {"Name": "Arden R.", "AuthorID": "25653875300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "6701707734": {"Name": "Malykh S.", "AuthorID": "6701707734", "AffiliationID": "116676932", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Institute of the Russian Academy of Education"}}}
