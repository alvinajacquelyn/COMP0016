The prosthesis features three telemetry-operated independent stimulators providing in total eighteen stimulation channels. The stimulator circuits were implemented in a 0.6-\u03bcm CMOS technology. The prosthesis is protected in a hermetically sealed ceramic enclosure and encapsulated in medical grade silicone rubber for long-term implantation. During the live demonstration in-vitro tests with electrodes in saline will be performed with the prosthesis operated wirelessly from a remote computer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CMOS technology", "Hermetically sealed", "In-vitro tests", "Medical grades", "Multi channel", "Remote computers", "Silicone rubber", "Stimulator circuits"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983442276", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"15922999900": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "15922999900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23008354200": {"Name": "Eder C.", "AuthorID": "23008354200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57039198600": {"Name": "Schormans M.", "AuthorID": "57039198600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57190842380": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "57190842380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "26428589100": {"Name": "Valente V.", "AuthorID": "26428589100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102272444": {"Name": "Perkins T.", "AuthorID": "7102272444", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "15723130500": {"Name": "Donaldson N.", "AuthorID": "15723130500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "35093291400": {"Name": "Vanhoestenberghe A.", "AuthorID": "35093291400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, University College London"}}}
