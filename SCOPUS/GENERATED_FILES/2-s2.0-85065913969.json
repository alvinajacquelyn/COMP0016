This study examined the effect of inorganic nitrate in beetroot juice on aortic (central) BP acutely and over the subsequent 24-h period. A double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial was performed in fifteen healthy, normotensive men and women (age 22-40 years). Participants were randomized to receive beetroot juice containing nitrate (6.5-7.3 mmol) or placebo beetroot juice from which nitrate had been removed (<0.06 mmol nitrate). Effects on aortic systolic BP were measured at 30 min (primary endpoint), 60 min and over a subsequent 24 h period using an ambulatory BP monitor. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) was also measured at 30 min. Following a washout period, the procedure was repeated within 7 days with crossover to the opposite arm of the trial. Compared with placebo, ingestion of beetroot juice containing nitrate lowered aortic systolic BP at 30 min by 5.2 (1.9-8.5) mmHg [mean (95% confidence interval); p < 0.01]. A smaller effect on aortic systolic BP was observed at 60 min. There were minimal effects on brachial BP or cfPWV. Effects on aortic systolic BP were not sustained over the subsequent 24 h and there were no effects on other hemodynamic parameters during ambulatory monitoring. A single dose of beetroot juice containing nitrate lowers aortic BP more effectively than brachial BP in the short term, but the effects are comparatively short-lived and do not persist over the course of the same day.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beetroot", "Blood pressure", "Double-blind", "Inorganic nitrate", "Placebo-controlled crossover study", "Pulse wave velocity", "Randomized"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065913969", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55855183600": {"Name": "Kukadia S.", "AuthorID": "55855183600", "AffiliationID": "60010719, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Heart and Lung Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL, University College London"}, "55481407300": {"Name": "Dehbi H.", "AuthorID": "55481407300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Cancer Trials Centre, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "15759182700": {"Name": "Coady E.", "AuthorID": "15759182700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL, University College London"}}}
