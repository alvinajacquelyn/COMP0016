All rights reserved.There exist published literature for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk monitoring in cancer survivors but the extent of monitoring in clinical oncology practice is unknown. We performed an interactive survey at a Royal College of Physicians conference (11 November 2016) attended by practitioners with an interest in late effects of cancer treatment and supplemented the survey with an audit among 32 lung cancer survivors treated at St Peter's NHS Hospital in 2012-2016. Among the practitioners, 40% reported CVD risk monitoring performed at least annually, which is compatible with European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Guidelines, but 31% indicated that monitoring was never performed. In contrast, 77% felt that at least an annual assessment was required (p<0.001). Corroborating these data, among the lung cancer survivors, 31% and 16% had lipids or glucose/HbA1C measured annually, and 28% and 31% had never had these tests performed since their cancer treatment. Alerting healthcare providers to review protocols may help reduce CVD after cancer treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiometabolic Risk", "CVD prevention", "Health Promotion", "Late Effects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cancer Survivors", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Female", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026774327", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57195276705": {"Name": "Kapoor A.", "AuthorID": "57195276705", "AffiliationID": "60012381", "AffiliationName": "Ashford and St Peter's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55585590400": {"Name": "Prakash V.", "AuthorID": "55585590400", "AffiliationID": "60012381", "AffiliationName": "Ashford and St Peter's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003745078": {"Name": "Sekhar M.", "AuthorID": "7003745078", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"}, "12647138100": {"Name": "Greenfield D.M.", "AuthorID": "12647138100", "AffiliationID": "60018736", "AffiliationName": "Weston Park Hospital"}, "8595450200": {"Name": "Hatton M.", "AuthorID": "8595450200", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "55897768200": {"Name": "Lean M.E.J.", "AuthorID": "55897768200", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, School of Medicine, University of Glasgow"}, "57209635793": {"Name": "Sharma P.", "AuthorID": "57209635793", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "14633418200": {"Name": "Han T.S.", "AuthorID": "14633418200", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Research, Royal Holloway, University of London"}}}
