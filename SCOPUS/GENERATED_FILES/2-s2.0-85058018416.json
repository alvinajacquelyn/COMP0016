Publication rights licensed to ACM.Software support tickets contain short and noisy text from the customers. Software products are often represented by various surface forms and informal abbreviations. Automatically identifying software mentions from support tickets and determining the official names and versions are helpful for many downstream applications, e.g., routing the support tickets to the right expert groups for support. In this work, we study the problem of software product name extraction and linking from support tickets. We first annotate and analyze sampled tickets to understand the language patterns. Next, we design features using local, contextual, and external information sources, for extraction and linking models. In experiments, we show that linear models with the proposed features are able to deliver better and more consistent results, compared with the state-of-the-art baseline models, even on dataset with sparse labels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Entity extraction", "Entity linking", "Support ticket"], "IndexKeywords": ["Downstream applications", "Entity extractions", "Entity linking", "External informations", "Language patterns", "Software products", "Software support", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058018416", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (all)", "DECI", "1800"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"57189214315": {"Name": "Han J.", "AuthorID": "57189214315", "AffiliationID": "60078616, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}, "57204941434": {"Name": "Goh K.H.", "AuthorID": "57204941434", "AffiliationID": "60078616, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}, "56484791800": {"Name": "Akbari M.", "AuthorID": "56484791800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7202552214": {"Name": "Sun A.", "AuthorID": "7202552214", "AffiliationID": "60078616, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}}}
