We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of GM magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) and volume to assess the regional localisation of reduced MTR (reflecting demyelination) and atrophy (reflecting neuro-axonal loss) in relapsingremitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Methods: A total of 98 people with MS (51 RRMS, 28 SPMS, 19 PPMS) and 29 controls had T1-weighted volumetric and magnetisation transfer scans. SPM8 was used to undertake voxel-based analysis (VBA) of GM tissue volumes and MTR. MS subgroups were compared with controls, adjusting for age and gender. A voxel-by-voxel basis correlation analysis between MTR and volume within each subject group was performed, using biological parametric mapping. Results: MTR reduction was more extensive than atrophy. RRMS and SPMS patients showed proportionately more atrophy in the deep GM. SPMS and PPMS patients showed proportionately greater cortical MTR reduction. RRMS patients demonstrated the most correlation of MTR reduction and atrophy in deep GM. In SPMS and PPMS patients, there was less extensive correlation. Conclusions: These results suggest that in the deep GM of RRMS patients, demyelination and neuroaxonal loss may be linked, while in SPMS and PPMS patients, neuro-axonal loss and demyelination may occur mostly independently.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atrophy", "demyelination", "grey matter", "magnetisation transfer ratio", "Multiple sclerosis", "voxel based analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Demyelinating Diseases", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Multiple Sclerosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938483702", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56123866100": {"Name": "Mallik S.", "AuthorID": "56123866100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, University College London"}, "12787588000": {"Name": "Samson R.S.", "AuthorID": "12787588000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, University College London"}, "55317343100": {"Name": "Sethi V.", "AuthorID": "55317343100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, University College London"}, "6602501665": {"Name": "Wheeler-Kingshott C.A.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, University College London"}, "57202559286": {"Name": "Miller D.H.", "AuthorID": "57202559286", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, University College London"}, "36010957200": {"Name": "Muhlert N.", "AuthorID": "36010957200", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170432", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, University College London, UK/School of Psychology: Cardiff University"}, "7004057758": {"Name": "Chard D.T.", "AuthorID": "7004057758", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, University College London, UK/National Institute for Health Research"}}}
