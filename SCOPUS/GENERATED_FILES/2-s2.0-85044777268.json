Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.Background/Aims: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often accompanied by hyperlipidemia, which accelerates progression of the disease. Podocyte injury can lead to dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier, which is associated with proteinuria, a risk marker for the progression of CKD. Our previous studies demonstrated that palmitic acid (PA) can induce podocyte apoptosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In the present study, we investigated the specific molecular mechanisms of PA-induced apoptosis in cultured podocytes. Methods: We cultured mouse podocytes and treated them with PA. Then, cell viability was measured using the Cell Counting Kit-8 colorimetric assay, lipid uptake was assessed by Oil Red O staining and boron-dipyrromethene staining, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry, mitochondrial injury was assessed by JC-1 staining and transmission electron microscopy, and mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy using the MitoSOX Red reagent. The effects of PA on the mitochondria-mediated caspase activation pathway were investigated by examining the expression of caspase-8, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, Bid, cytochrome c, and Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) using western blotting. The translocation of Bax and cytochrome c were detected by immunofluorescence. Results: PA treatment significantly increased lipid accumulation and induced podocyte apoptosis. We investigated whether the two primary apoptosis signaling pathways (death receptor-mediated pathway and mitochondria-mediated pathway) were involved in the execution of PA-induced podocyte apoptosis, and found that the levels of FADD, caspase-8, and Bid did not significantly change during this process. Meanwhile, PA treatment induced an increase in Bax protein expression and a decrease in Bcl-2 protein expression, with Bax translocation to the mitochondria. Furthermore, PA treatment induced mitochondrial impairment, and triggered the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol, with a concomitant dose-dependent increase in the levels of cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, and PARP. Meanwhile, PA treatment increased mitochondrial production of ROS, and the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO significantly ameliorated PA-induced podocyte apoptosis. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that PA induced caspase-dependent podocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, and mitochondrial ROS production participated in this process, thus potentially contributing to podocyte injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Mitochondria", "Palmitic acid (PA)", "Podocyte", "Reactive oxygen species (ROS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Caspases", "Cells, Cultured", "Mice", "Mitochondria", "Palmitic Acid", "Podocytes", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044777268", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57218174003": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "57218174003", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "57201398367": {"Name": "Sun J.Y.", "AuthorID": "57201398367", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "57193433902": {"Name": "Jiang X.S.", "AuthorID": "57193433902", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "57216625898": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57216625898", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "36243125500": {"Name": "Du X.G.", "AuthorID": "36243125500", "AffiliationID": "120005785", "AffiliationName": "Chongqing Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine in Major Metabolic Disease"}, "56086619100": {"Name": "Chen X.M.", "AuthorID": "56086619100", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Emergency Department, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "57201391009": {"Name": "Yang S.", "AuthorID": "57201391009", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Emergency Department, First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "55744665000": {"Name": "Huang H.Z.", "AuthorID": "55744665000", "AffiliationID": "60020870", "AffiliationName": "Second Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University"}, "57203413669": {"Name": "Ruan X.Z.", "AuthorID": "57203413669", "AffiliationID": "60020870, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Lipid Research, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biology on Infectious Diseases, Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University"}}}
