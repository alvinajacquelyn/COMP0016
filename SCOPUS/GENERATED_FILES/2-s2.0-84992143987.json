The parameter \u03b2<\u221e indicates the steepness of the slope of a nonlinear smooth sigmoid function and the limit case \u03b2=\u221e corresponds to a discontinuous unit step function. We prove that spatially localized solutions to the fixed point problem for large \u03b2 exist and can be approximated by the fixed points of H\u221e. These results are of a high importance in biological applications where one often approximates the smooth sigmoid by discontinuous unit step function. Moreover, in order to achieve even better approximation than a solution of the limit problem, we employ the iterative method that has several advantages compared to other existing methods. For example, this method can be used to construct non-isolated homoclinic orbit of a Hamiltonian system of equations. We illustrate the results and advantages of the numerical method for stationary versions of the FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo reaction\u2013diffusion equation and a neural field model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bumps", "FitzHugh\u2013Nagumo model", "Neural field model", "Nonlinear integral equations", "Sigmoid type nonlinearities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992143987", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57191617651": {"Name": "Oleynik A.", "AuthorID": "57191617651", "AffiliationID": "60007008", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences and Technology, Norwegian University of Life Sciences"}, "9632504900": {"Name": "Ponosov A.", "AuthorID": "9632504900", "AffiliationID": "60007008", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences and Technology, Norwegian University of Life Sciences"}, "57205012802": {"Name": "Kostrykin V.", "AuthorID": "57205012802", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "FB 08 - Institut f\u00fcr Mathematik, Johannes Gutenberg-Universit\u00e4t Mainz"}, "16644000200": {"Name": "Sobolev A.", "AuthorID": "16644000200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
