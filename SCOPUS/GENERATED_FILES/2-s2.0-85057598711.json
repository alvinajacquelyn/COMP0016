Initiating bioenergetic collapse and cell death, it has been implicated in the pathophysiology of major human diseases, including neuromuscular diseases of childhood, ischaemia-reperfusion injury, and age-related neurodegenerative disease. Opening of the mPTP represents a major therapeutic target, as it can be mitigated by a number of compounds. However, clinical studies have so far been disappointing. We therefore address the prospects and challenges faced in translating in vitro findings to clinical benefit. We review the role of mPTP opening in disease, discuss recent findings defining the putative structure of the mPTP, and explore strategies to identify novel, clinically useful mPTP inhibitors, highlighting key considerations in the drug discovery process.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calcium", "cyclophilin D", "drug discovery", "mitochondria", "mPTP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Death", "Child", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neuromuscular Diseases", "Reperfusion Injury"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057598711", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"54418552800": {"Name": "Briston T.", "AuthorID": "54418552800", "AffiliationID": "60018508", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Innovation Centre, Hatfield Research Laboratories, Eisai Ltd."}, "6604070021": {"Name": "Selwood D.L.", "AuthorID": "6604070021", "AffiliationID": "60089914", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "6602576918": {"Name": "Szabadkai G.", "AuthorID": "6602576918", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7005847722": {"Name": "Duchen M.R.", "AuthorID": "7005847722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Consortium for Mitochondrial Research, University College London"}}}
