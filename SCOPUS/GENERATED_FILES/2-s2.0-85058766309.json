Published by MMCTS on behalf of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. All rights reserved.The phenotypic features of the heart with ventricular septal defects will be shown in this video tutorial. There is still no agreement as to whether it's best to categorize lesions on the basis of their geography or their borders. Both geography and borders are features that are of importance. I hope this video will persuade you that the borders are the most significant because they display the phenotypic variance and give added information about the heart regarding the location of the atrioventricular conduction axis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiology", "Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Ventricular Septum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058766309", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "16643657100": {"Name": "Spicer D.E.", "AuthorID": "16643657100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57205135007": {"Name": "Saavedra J.", "AuthorID": "57205135007", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "35375086900": {"Name": "Backer C.L.", "AuthorID": "35375086900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
