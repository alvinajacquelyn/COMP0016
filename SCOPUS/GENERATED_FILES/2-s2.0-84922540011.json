The introduction of cytotoxic therapy has changed the prognosis for these diseases from typically fatal to manageable chronic illnesses with a relapsing course. Despite improvements in outcomes, recurrence of disease and drug-related toxicity continue to produce significant morbidity and mortality. Better understanding of the pathogenesis of AAV and the mechanism of action of cyclophosphamide has led to investigation of therapies that target B cells. Two randomized controlled trials have shown that rituximab is not inferior to cyclophosphamide for induction of remission in severe AAV, with no significant difference in the incidence of overall adverse events in rituximab- versus cyclophosphamide-treated patients. Data from ongoing clinical trials will determine the role of rituximab in the maintenance of remission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody", "Renal", "Rituximab", "Vasculitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cyclophosphamide", "Glucocorticoids", "Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Maintenance Chemotherapy", "Microscopic Polyangiitis", "Recurrence", "Remission Induction", "Rituximab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922540011", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"22953320400": {"Name": "Geetha D.", "AuthorID": "22953320400", "AffiliationID": "60001117, 60030952", "AffiliationName": "Division of Nephrology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center"}, "35395889100": {"Name": "Kallenberg C.", "AuthorID": "35395889100", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "7403061301": {"Name": "Stone J.H.", "AuthorID": "7403061301", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "55366513900": {"Name": "Salama A.D.", "AuthorID": "55366513900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, UCL"}, "7006427930": {"Name": "Appel G.B.", "AuthorID": "7006427930", "AffiliationID": "60011605", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, The Glomerular Kidney Disease Center"}, "6602662152": {"Name": "Duna G.", "AuthorID": "6602662152", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech, Inc."}, "55393240900": {"Name": "Brunetta P.", "AuthorID": "55393240900", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech, Inc."}, "7006525072": {"Name": "Jayne D.", "AuthorID": "7006525072", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Vasculitis and Lupus Clinic, Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital"}}}
