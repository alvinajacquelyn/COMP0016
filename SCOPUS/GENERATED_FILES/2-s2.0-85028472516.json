This enables rapid estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and avoids the need of integral evaluations and split-step simulations. The accuracy of the proposed formula is compared to numerical integration of the Gaussian noise (GN) model and split-step simulations over a wide range of parameters, including three different fiber types. Additionally, the impact of pump depletion on the NLI noise power is studied and the formula is applied to a second-order Raman-amplified system. In the case of first-order amplification and negligible pump depletion, a maximum deviation of 0.34 dB in NLI coefficient between the GN model and the closed-form formula is found, which corresponds to a maximum deviation of $\\sim$0.1 dB in optimal SNR or similar figures of merit (e.g., maximum reach). When pump depletion is considered, it is shown that the NLI coefficient becomes a function of launch power and as a result the cubic power dependence of the NLI noise power is no longer valid in such regimes. Finally, for the second-order Raman-amplified system, a maximum deviation of 0.39 dB in NLI coefficient is reported.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Channel model", "Gaussian noise model", "nonlinear distortion", "nonlinear interference", "optical fiber communications", "Raman amplification"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attenuation", "Channel model", "Closed form solutions", "Gaussian noise model", "Raman amplification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028472516", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57192990604": {"Name": "Semrau D.", "AuthorID": "57192990604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "57193389959": {"Name": "Saavedra G.", "AuthorID": "57193389959", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.I.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Optical Networks Group, University College London"}}}
