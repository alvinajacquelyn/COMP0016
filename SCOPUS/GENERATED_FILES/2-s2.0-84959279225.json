We investigated whether a community-based roadshow was an effective way of communicating with the public about cancer and encouraging behavior change. Data were from 1196 people who completed questionnaires at a Cancer Research UK Cancer Awareness Roadshow in 2013. Of these, 511 (43%) completed questionnaires immediately before their visit (pre-visit group) and 685 (57%) completed questionnaires immediately after their visit (post-visit group). Among the post-visit sample, 217 (32%) were retained after two months. Self-reported data were available on risk factor and symptom awareness, help-seeking barriers, use of healthcare services and health behaviors. Compared with the pre-visit sample, the post-visit group had greater awareness of cancer risk factors and was more positive about aspects of help-seeking but awareness of potential symptoms was similar. Most effects were maintained over two months. Intentions to eat more fruit and vegetables and to exercise more were comparable between the groups but more people in the post-visit sample intended to quit smoking. At 2-month follow-up, smoking prevalence had significantly reduced but fruit and vegetable consumption decreased and there was no change to physical activity. User of weight loss services and general practitioner visits were high at follow-up and largely attributed to the Roadshow. The Cancer Research UK Roadshow appears to improve risk factor awareness, promote positive attitudes towards help-seeking and increase smoking cessation. This approach could be a useful building block for additional cancer prevention and control strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer awareness", "Cancer control", "Cancer prevention", "Community interventions", "Early diagnosis", "Health behaviors", "Health communication", "Mobile information units", "Roadshow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Awareness", "Community Health Services", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Risk Factors", "Smoking Cessation", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959279225", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55501030300": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "55501030300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56463777600": {"Name": "Osborne K.", "AuthorID": "56463777600", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK"}, "23978643600": {"Name": "Power E.", "AuthorID": "23978643600", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK"}, "57144434900": {"Name": "Tring S.", "AuthorID": "57144434900", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK"}, "55943024900": {"Name": "George H.", "AuthorID": "55943024900", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK"}}}
