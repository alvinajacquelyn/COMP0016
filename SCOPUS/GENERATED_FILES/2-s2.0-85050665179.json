However, they are typically treated separately and there is a dearth of information on tackling them together. Aims The study\u2019s purpose was to establish how best to treat co-occurring anxiety and depression in a routine clinical service\u2014specifically, to compare cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) focusing only on depression (CBT-D) to a broader CBT focusing on both depression and anxiety (CBT-DA). Method Case notes of 69 patients with equally severe clinical levels of depression and anxiety seen in a routine clinical service were randomly selected to review from a pool of 990 patients. The mean age was 44.61 years (SD = 12.97). 65% of the sample were female and 88% reported their ethnicity white. The content of electronic records reporting techniques used and scores on a measure of depression (The Patient Health Questionnaire) and anxiety (The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment) were reviewed to categorise therapy as CBT-D or CBT-DA. Results Results indicated significant overall improvement with CBT; 70% and 77% of the sample met criteria for reliable improvement on The Patient Health Questionnaire and The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment respectively. Fewer patients who received CBT-DA met The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment recovery criteria at the end of treatment than those who received CBT-D. Mean post treatment PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores remained above threshold for those receiving CBT_DA but not those receiving CBT-D. There was no evidence suggesting CBT-DA was superior to CBT-D. Conclusions In patients with equally severe clinical levels of depression and anxiety, a broader treatment addressing both anxiety and depression does not appear to be associated with improved outcomes compared to treatment focused on depression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety Disorders", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Depressive Disorder", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050665179", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003543961": {"Name": "Shafran R.", "AuthorID": "7003543961", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences"}, "57194720358": {"Name": "Pissaridou E.", "AuthorID": "57194720358", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences"}, "25958950300": {"Name": "Coughtrey A.", "AuthorID": "25958950300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences"}, "6601988450": {"Name": "Wroe A.", "AuthorID": "6601988450", "AffiliationID": "60159751", "AffiliationName": "Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203142713": {"Name": "Nagra S.", "AuthorID": "57203142713", "AffiliationID": "60159751", "AffiliationName": "Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
