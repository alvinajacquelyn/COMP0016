Analytical theory and simulations show the shortening of the self-focal length of a laser beam in a plasma as a result of the reduction of the plasma thermal conductivity in a magnetic field. Furthermore, the filamentation of a laser via the thermal mechanism is found to have an increased spatial growth rate in a magnetised plasma. We discuss the effect of these results on recent magnetised inertial fusion experiments where filamentation can be detrimental to laser propagation and uniform laser heating. We conclude that the application of external magnetic fields to laser-plasma experiments requires the inclusion of the extended electron transport terms in simulations of laser propagation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical theory", "Electron transport", "External magnetic field", "Laser plasma experiments", "Laser propagation", "Thermal mechanisms", "Transport coefficient", "Underdense plasmas"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053005007", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57203806632": {"Name": "Watkins H.", "AuthorID": "57203806632", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "6701584026": {"Name": "Kingham R.", "AuthorID": "6701584026", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}}}
