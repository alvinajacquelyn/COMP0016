Methods: A survey was administered, comprising Likert scales, forced response and single option questions, and free text responses, at five different courses or events for those interested in a career in ENT. Results: The survey had an 87 per cent response rate; respondents consisted of 43 applicants for national selection, 15 foundation doctors and 23 medical students. The most important factors that encourage ENT as a career included: the variety of operative procedures, work-life balance, inherent interest in this clinical area and inspirational senior role models. Exposure to ENT in undergraduate or post-graduate training is critical in deciding to pursue this specialty. Conclusion: It is important to promote those aspects of ENT surgery that attract people to it, and to argue for greater exposure to ENT during undergraduate and post-graduate training.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Career Choice", "Otolaryngology", "Surveys"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Career Choice", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Medical Staff, Hospital", "Otolaryngology", "Students, Medical", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991650752", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"35236121400": {"Name": "Bhutta M.", "AuthorID": "35236121400", "AffiliationID": "101752360", "AffiliationName": "Children's Surgical Centre"}, "55675790000": {"Name": "Mandavia R.", "AuthorID": "55675790000", "AffiliationID": "60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute"}, "7102086722": {"Name": "Saeed S.", "AuthorID": "7102086722", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "24068012400": {"Name": "Syed I.", "AuthorID": "24068012400", "AffiliationID": "60001497", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department, University Hospital Lewisham"}, "7201433996": {"Name": "Qureshi A.", "AuthorID": "7201433996", "AffiliationID": "60008323", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "24331175300": {"Name": "Hettige R.", "AuthorID": "24331175300", "AffiliationID": "60008323", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "36088266300": {"Name": "Wong B.Y.W.", "AuthorID": "36088266300", "AffiliationID": "60015692", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department, Pinderfield Hospitals"}, "35512600100": {"Name": "Cartledge J.", "AuthorID": "35512600100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Centre for Medical Education, University College London"}}}
