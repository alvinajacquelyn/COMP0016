Particle shape and size analysis, obtained by dynamic imaging analysis, for each material in the database has subsequently been linked to its mechanical properties; selected sands were also subject to interferometry study for particle surface roughness measurements. This paper reviews the effect of the particle shape properties of these sands on their Critical State and stiffness parameters, introducing a new parameter to optimize the correlations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angularity", "Critical state", "Dynamic imaging analysis", "Particle shape", "Sand", "Stiffness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angularity", "Critical state", "Dynamic imaging", "Mechanical behavior", "Particle shape", "Particle shape and size", "Particle surface roughness", "Stiffness parameters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997522716", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"]], "AuthorData": {"25637246000": {"Name": "Altuhafi F.", "AuthorID": "25637246000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Earth Sciences, Univ.
