The accuracy gains these approaches offer make them attractive for the next generation of mobile, wearable and embedded sensory applications. However, state-of-The-Art deep learning algorithms typically require a significant amount of device and processor resources, even just for the inference stages that are used to discriminate high-level classes from low-level data. The limited availability of memory, computation, and energy on mobile and embedded platforms thus pose a significant challenge to the adoption of these powerful learning techniques. In this paper, we propose SparseSep, a new approach that leverages the sparsification of fully connected layers and separation of convolutional kernels to reduce the resource requirements of popular deep learning algorithms. As a result, SparseSep allows large-scale DNNs and CNNs to run efficiently on mobile and embedded hardware with only minimal impact on inference accuracy. We experiment using SparseSep across a variety of common processors such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, ARM Cortex M0 and M3, and NVIDIA Tegra K1, and show that it allows inference for various deep models to execute more efficiently; for example, on average requiring 11.3 times less memory and running 13.3 times faster on these representative platforms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep Learning", "Sparse Coding", "Wearable Computing", "Weight Factorization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Constrained resources", "Convolutional kernel", "Deep learning", "Mobile and embedded platforms", "Processor resources", "Resource requirements", "Sparse coding", "Wearable computing"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007061061", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57183450500": {"Name": "Bhattacharya S.", "AuthorID": "57183450500", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "23135333200": {"Name": "Lane N.D.", "AuthorID": "23135333200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
