The Authors.High-resolution multispacecraft Swarm data are used to examine magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling during a period of northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on 31 May 2014. The observations reveal a prevalence of unexpectedly large amplitude (>100 nT) and time-varying magnetic perturbations during the polar passes, with especially large amplitude magnetic perturbations being associated with large-scale downward field-aligned currents. Differences between the magnetic field measurements sampled at 50 Hz from Swarm A and C, approximately 10 s apart along track, and the correspondence between the observed electric and magnetic fields at 16 samples per second, provide significant evidence for an important role for Alfv\u00e9n waves in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling even during northward IMF conditions. Spectral comparison between the wave E- and B-fields reveals a frequency-dependent phase difference and amplitude ratio consistent with interference between incident and reflected Alfv\u00e9n waves. At low frequencies, the E/B ratio is in phase with an amplitude determined by the Pedersen conductance. At higher frequencies, the amplitude and phase change as a function of frequency in good agreement with an ionospheric Alfv\u00e9n resonator model including Pedersen conductance effects. Indeed, within this Alfv\u00e9n wave incidence, reflection, and interference paradigm, even quasi-static field-aligned currents might be reasonably interpreted as very low frequency (\u03c9 \u2192 0) Alfv\u00e9n waves. Overall, our results not only indicate the importance of Alfv\u00e9n waves for magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling but also demonstrate a method for using Swarm data for the innovative experimental diagnosis of Pedersen conductance from low-Earth orbit satellite measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alfv\u00e9n waves", "Birkeland currents", "ionosphere", "magnetosphere", "magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction", "wave reflection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040654719", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"55838636700": {"Name": "Pakhotin I.P.", "AuthorID": "55838636700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Alberta"}, "7006618037": {"Name": "Mann I.R.", "AuthorID": "7006618037", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Alberta"}, "55190751500": {"Name": "Miles D.M.", "AuthorID": "55190751500", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa"}, "8447746700": {"Name": "Ozeke L.G.", "AuthorID": "8447746700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Alberta"}, "6602178064": {"Name": "Lysak R.L.", "AuthorID": "6602178064", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota"}, "7006944621": {"Name": "Knudsen D.J.", "AuthorID": "7006944621", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "University of Calgary"}, "6508172463": {"Name": "Gjerloev J.W.", "AuthorID": "6508172463", "AffiliationID": "60022054", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory"}, "7003431703": {"Name": "Rae I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003431703", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "23488620900": {"Name": "Forsyth C.", "AuthorID": "23488620900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "25723507400": {"Name": "Murphy K.R.", "AuthorID": "25723507400", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"}, "6506101367": {"Name": "Balasis G.", "AuthorID": "6506101367", "AffiliationID": "60011619", "AffiliationName": "National Observatory of Athens"}}}
