While much of the global literature on global citizenship education (GCE) primarily takes into account the perspectives of middle-class or elite students located in richer economies, the current study is centred on a socio-demographically diverse group of young people in a low-income setting. With a specific focus on their negotiation of issues around diversity and justice, students\u2019 narratives generated important recommendations for a transformative and historically nuanced postcolonial/decolonial approach to global citizenship engagement that should be considered more broadly. The study illuminates the ways the global/local historical, cultural, political and economic factors influence individual relationship with GCE and offers useful pedagogical and policy implications for GCE \u2018from below\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Global citizenship education", "Pakistan", "peace education", "postcolonial", "religion", "youth"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055581300", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55933032300": {"Name": "Kadiwal L.", "AuthorID": "55933032300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "25421394400": {"Name": "Durrani N.", "AuthorID": "25421394400", "AffiliationID": "60104301", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Education, Nazarbayev University"}}}
