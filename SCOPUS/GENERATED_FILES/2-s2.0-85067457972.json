Using an ethnographic case study the article demonstrates how different pedagogical approaches are used with different \u2018ability\u2019 groups. The pedagogical experiences of children, especially within \u2018low\u2019 ability groups potentially limit children\u2019s exposure to the tools required for successful participation in school. This varied pedagogy serves to govern, limit and constrain some young children\u2019s aspirations and expectations and operates as a self-fulfilling prophecy. When the perception of \u2018ability\u2019 is seen as fixed, it influences the interactional experiences of children within different groups which, consequently, enhances or contains children\u2019s future participation in school activity. The article concludes by suggesting that early years ability grouping needs to be contested and alternative pedagogies tried. This requires a reduction in \u2018high stakes\u2019 performance data and trust placed in early years teachers\u2019 pedagogical decision-making processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ability grouping", "learner identities", "Pedagogy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067457972", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"37069905200": {"Name": "Roberts-Holmes G.", "AuthorID": "37069905200", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Learning and Leadership, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57209339426": {"Name": "Kitto E.", "AuthorID": "57209339426", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Learning and Leadership, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
