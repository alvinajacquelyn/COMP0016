Recent clinical trials and real-world studies have demonstrated the advantages of a Treat-and-Extend (T&E) regimen, and many hospital departments are now in the process of adopting this new regimen in favor of the pro re nata regimen for initiating and continuing ranibizumab therapy for patients with wet AMD. The comprehensive spectrum of issues related to implementation of the regimen is covered qualitatively in ten didactic topics provided by a group of clinicians with direct experience of this regimen in their department. The topics include definition, new and previously treated eyes, management of high-frequency injections, maximum extensions, discontinuing T&E, bilateral cases, clerical, audit, and patient counseling. This article aims to provide a useful resource for the implementation of the T&E regimen. A quantitative summary of the visual outcomes in key publications is also provided in this article. This article should be a valuable resource for staff training.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Anti-VEGF treatment", "NAMD", "Ranibizumab", "Treat and Extend"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057719140", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"6701405810": {"Name": "Amoaku W.", "AuthorID": "6701405810", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Academic Ophthalmology, Division of Clinical Neuroscience, University of Nottingham"}, "35221042600": {"Name": "Balaskas K.", "AuthorID": "35221042600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "57207625049": {"Name": "Cudrnak T.", "AuthorID": "57207625049", "AffiliationID": "60005671", "AffiliationName": "Royal Eye Infirmary, University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust"}, "7006473170": {"Name": "Downey L.", "AuthorID": "7006473170", "AffiliationID": "60005954", "AffiliationName": "Hull and East Yorkshire Eye Hospital, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "15750724200": {"Name": "Groppe M.", "AuthorID": "15750724200", "AffiliationID": "60005186", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology, Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "23995482000": {"Name": "Mahmood S.", "AuthorID": "23995482000", "AffiliationID": "60023665, 60120605, 60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "36806518600": {"Name": "Mehta H.", "AuthorID": "36806518600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15923394600": {"Name": "Mohamed Q.", "AuthorID": "15923394600", "AffiliationID": "60002465, 60021179", "AffiliationName": "Gloucestershire Eye Unit, Cheltenham General Hospital, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16507560200": {"Name": "Mushtaq B.", "AuthorID": "16507560200", "AffiliationID": "60007419, 60017140", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre, Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust"}, "16310842600": {"Name": "Severn P.", "AuthorID": "16310842600", "AffiliationID": "60014315", "AffiliationName": "South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36714467800": {"Name": "Vardarinos A.", "AuthorID": "36714467800", "AffiliationID": "60014768", "AffiliationName": "Eye Treatment Centre, West Suffolk Hospital, West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8514483500": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "8514483500", "AffiliationID": "60006255", "AffiliationName": "Wolverhampton Eye Infirmary, The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust"}, "56289017200": {"Name": "Younis S.", "AuthorID": "56289017200", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60016550", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology, Western Eye Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
