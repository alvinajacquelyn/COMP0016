This study investigated patterns of ACEI use for various indications. Methods: A descriptive, retrospective population-based study was conducted using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Patients starting ACEIs (2007\u20132014) were selected and ACEI indications were retrieved from electronically recorded medical records. Stratified by indication, we distinguished between persistent and nonpersistent ACEI use, considering a 6-month interval between two prescription periods as a maximum for persistent use. Five-year persistence rates for various indications were calculated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and compared in a log-rank test. Nonpersistent users were subdivided into three groups: (i) stop; (ii) restart; and (iii) switch to an angiotensin II-receptor blocker. Patients who received ACEIs for hypertension who switched to other classes of antihypertensive medications were further investigated. Results: In total, 254 002 ACEI initiators were identified with hypertension (57.6%), myocardial infarction (MI; 4.2%), renal disease (RD; 3.7%), heart failure (HF; 1.5%), combinations of the above (17.2%) or none of the above (15.8%). Five-year persistence rates ranged from 43.2% (RD) to 68.2% (MI; P < 0.0001). RD and HF patients used ACEIs for the shortest time (average 23.6 and 25.0 months, respectively). For the nonpersistent group, the percentage of switchers to angiotensin II-receptor blockers ranged from 27.6% (RD) to 42.2% (MI) and the restarters ranged from 15.0% (HF) to 18.1% (group without indication). Conclusions: Depending on the indication, there are various rates of ACEI nonpersistence. Patients with RD are most likely to discontinue treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACE inhibitors", "heart failure", "hypertension", "medication persistence", "myocardial infarction", "renal disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Databases, Factual", "Drug Prescriptions", "Drug Substitution", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Renal Insufficiency", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050491033", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55587402600": {"Name": "Mahmoudpour S.", "AuthorID": "55587402600", "AffiliationID": "60022135", "AffiliationName": "Center for Thrombosis and Hemostasis (CTH), University Medical Centre of the Johannes Gutenberg University"}, "6602559184": {"Name": "Souverein P.", "AuthorID": "6602559184", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht University"}, "56489803600": {"Name": "de Boer A.", "AuthorID": "56489803600", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht University"}, "6602464879": {"Name": "Maitland-van der Zee A.", "AuthorID": "6602464879", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research and Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}}}
