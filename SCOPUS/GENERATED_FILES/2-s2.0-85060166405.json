The same measurements in p+A collisions serve as an important baseline for understanding the observations in A+A collisions. For example, detailed studies of heavy-flavor hadron azimuthal anisotropy in p+A collisions may help to address whether the observed long-range \u201cridge\u201d correlation arises from hard or semi-hard processes, or if it is the result of mechanisms unrelated to the initial hardness scale. These proceedings summarize heavy-flavor hadron production, via their semi-leptonic decay to muons in 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb and pp collisions, non-prompt J/\u03c8 in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb and pp collisions, and prompt D0 mesons in 8.16 TeV p+Pb collisions using ATLAS detector at the LHC. Azimuthal anisotropy of heavy-flavor hadrons is studied via their decay muons in 2.76 TeV Pb+Pb and 8.16 TeV p+Pb collisions, and via non-prompt J/\u03c8 in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions. Strong suppression of heavy-flavor hadron production and azimuthal anisotropy are observed in Pb+Pb collisions, while significant azimuthal anisotropy of heavy-flavor muons is observed in p+Pb collisions, without evidence of the modification of their production rates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060166405", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"56579555100": {"Name": "Hu Q.", "AuthorID": "56579555100", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado Boulder"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
