This case study describes an 11-year-old girl with recurrent, severe, frontal headaches occurring during airplane travel. The episodes were associated with dizziness and facial pallor but no additional symptoms and showed spontaneous resolution on landing. Blood tests and imaging revealed no abnormalities. The present case fulfils the criteria for airplane headache recently included in the revised edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-III Beta). Only a few cases of airplane headache have been reported in children. To our knowledge, this is the fourth case. We review the current literature on this rare syndrome and discuss various proposed pathophysiological mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["airplane headache", "case report", "childhood headache disorders", "pediatric"], "IndexKeywords": ["Air Travel", "Aircraft", "Child", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Headache", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928199778", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56601102600": {"Name": "Rogers K.", "AuthorID": "56601102600", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Queen's University Hospital"}, "56601286800": {"Name": "Rafiq N.", "AuthorID": "56601286800", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Queen's University Hospital"}, "7402832035": {"Name": "Ahmed M.", "AuthorID": "7402832035", "AffiliationID": "60007937", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Queen's University Hospital"}, "36145414500": {"Name": "Prabhakar P.", "AuthorID": "36145414500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
