Interpolation is necessary for cosmological parameter estimation due to the limited number of simulations possible. We construct an emulator for the \\Lya forest flux power spectrum from 21 small simulations using Latin hypercube sampling and Gaussian process interpolation. We show that this emulator has a typical accuracy of 1.5% and a worst-case accuracy of 4%, which compares well to the current statistical error of 3-5% at z < 3 from BOSS DR9. We compare to the previous state of the art, quadratic polynomial interpolation. The Latin hypercube samples the entire volume of parameter space, while quadratic polynomial emulation samples only lower-dimensional subspaces. The Gaussian process provides an estimate of the emulation error and we show using test simulations that this estimate is reasonable. We construct a likelihood function and use it to show that the posterior constraints generated using the emulator are unbiased. We show that our Gaussian process emulator has lower emulation error than quadratic polynomial interpolation and thus produces tighter posterior confidence intervals, which will be essential for future Lyman-\u03b1 surveys such as DESI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmological parameters from LSS", "Cosmological simulations", "Lyman alpha forest"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062291293", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"25630446200": {"Name": "Bird S.", "AuthorID": "25630446200", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University"}, "57190816407": {"Name": "Rogers K.K.", "AuthorID": "57190816407", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics, Stockholm University, AlbaNova"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "27267690300": {"Name": "Font-Ribera A.", "AuthorID": "27267690300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "22036053000": {"Name": "Pontzen A.", "AuthorID": "22036053000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7003944328": {"Name": "Verde L.", "AuthorID": "7003944328", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats, Passeig Llu\u00eds Companys 23"}}}
