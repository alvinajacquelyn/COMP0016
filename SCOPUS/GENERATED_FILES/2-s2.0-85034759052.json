Progress has been made towards hardware and software interfaces, connectivity with nearby devices, and understanding human behaviour on and around the table \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yet, in practice tabletops see limited use. This workshop seeks to explore the development and use of tabletops from historical, technical, and social perspectives. Workshop goals include synthesizing opinion and experience from new and established researchers on future directions of tabletop research, and an open discussion of questions such as to what applications are tabletops best suited? and how can tabletops be better integrated into larger workflows and digital ecosystems?", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaboration", "Cross-surface", "Historical perspective", "Tabletop"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collaboration", "Digital ecosystem", "Hardware and software", "Historical perspective", "Human behaviours", "Social perspective", "Tabletop", "Technical challenges"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034759052", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"14832021500": {"Name": "Wallace J.", "AuthorID": "14832021500", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health and Health Systems, University of Waterloo"}, "16230372800": {"Name": "Lucero A.", "AuthorID": "16230372800", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "School of Arts, Design and Architecture, Aalto University Finland"}, "55247206500": {"Name": "Houben S.", "AuthorID": "55247206500", "AffiliationID": "60117772, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University"}, "16306402300": {"Name": "Anslow C.", "AuthorID": "16306402300", "AffiliationID": "60002316", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Computer Science, Victoria University of Wellington"}, "7003925319": {"Name": "Rogers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003925319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}, "7401505948": {"Name": "Scott S.", "AuthorID": "7401505948", "AffiliationID": "60015881", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, University of Guelph"}}}
