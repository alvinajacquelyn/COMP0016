Mothers reported on the use of child-care services, while elementary school teachers rated children's shyness, social withdrawal, prosociality, opposition, and aggression. Children who received nonparental child-care services were less shy, less socially withdrawn, more oppositional, and more aggressive at school entry (age 6 years). However, these differences disappeared during elementary school as children who received exclusive parental care caught up with those who received nonparental care services. This \"catch-up\" effect from the perspective of children's adaptation to the social group is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Aggression", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Child Care", "Child Development", "Female", "Group Processes", "Humans", "Male", "Quebec", "Registries", "Shyness", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941247962", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57188642378": {"Name": "Tremblay R.", "AuthorID": "57188642378", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "University of Montreal"}, "56803476500": {"Name": "Vitaro F.", "AuthorID": "56803476500", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "University of Montreal"}, "15822473500": {"Name": "Japel C.", "AuthorID": "15822473500", "AffiliationID": "60027863", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al"}, "55769906600": {"Name": "Boivin M.", "AuthorID": "55769906600", "AffiliationID": "60016896", "AffiliationName": "Tomsk State University"}, "7006183959": {"Name": "C\u00f4t\u00e9 S.", "AuthorID": "7006183959", "AffiliationID": "60016896", "AffiliationName": "Tomsk State University"}}}
