Within this temperature range, galena can be described by a simple phenomenological model in which the cation and anion vibrate independently of one another in a Debye-like manner, with vibrational Debye temperatures of 120(1) K for the lead, and 324(2) K for the sulfur. Simultaneous fitting of the unit cell volume and the isochoric heat capacity to a two-term Debye internal energy function gives characteristic temperatures of 110(2), and 326(5) K in excellent agreement with the measured vibrational Debye temperatures derived from fitting the atomic displacement parameters. The thermodynamic Gr\u00fcneisen constant derived from the isochoric heat capacity is found to monotonically increase with decreasing temperature, from 2.5 at 300 K, to 3.25 at 25 K, in agreement with the deductions of earlier work. The full phonon density of states calculated from the two-term Debye model shows fair agreement with that derived from density functional theory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chalcogenide", "Galena", "Heat capacity", "Neutron diffraction", "Thermal expansion", "Thermoelastic properties"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic displacement parameters", "Characteristic temperature", "Galena", "High resolution neutron powder diffraction data", "Isochoric heat capacity", "Phenomenological modeling", "Phonon density of state", "Thermoelastic properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925516114", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.S.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}}}
