Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only.We advance our previous research on spread spectrum spectroscopy by adding spectroscopic functionality using a custom-made optical transceiver. The new transceiver module features a 680nm communications-grade verticalcavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and matches the performance of commercial 10Gb/s optical transceivers, which allow for a sub-ns instrument response. The optical power of the VCSEL can be software-Adjusted up to 2mW with \u00e21/440\u03bcA driving current resolution. This module, combined with a commercially available Gigabit optical transceiver at 850nm, allows us to derive information about the optical properties of tissue-equivalent phantoms and the concentration of various haemodynamic parameters in in vivo measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Field programmable gate array", "Near infrared spectroscopy", "Optical transceiver", "Spread spectrum", "Time-domain", "Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffuse optical imaging", "Driving current", "In-vivo measurement", "Spectroscopic systems", "Spread spectra", "Time domain", "Tissue equivalent phantom", "Transceiver modules"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064814225", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55357565700": {"Name": "Papadimitriou K.", "AuthorID": "55357565700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science"}, "7004407749": {"Name": "Hebden J.", "AuthorID": "7004407749", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7201575253": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "7201575253", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}}}
