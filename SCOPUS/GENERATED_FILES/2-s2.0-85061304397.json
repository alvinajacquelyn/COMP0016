In this paper, a new micromechanical apparatus is presented along with calibration and reliability tests, which is designed in a way that the interface behavior of granular materials can be examined for a broad range of shearing velocities of five-orders of magnitude utilizing a dynamic data-logger and high-resolution sensors. The results showed that the shearing velocity between 0.4 and 1,340 mm/h did not influence the response of dry grain-grain interfaces including engineered and natural grains, but it significantly affected the frictional behavior of composite grain-rubber interfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coefficient of friction", "Dry friction", "Friction measurement", "Sliding friction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coefficient of frictions", "Dry friction", "Friction measurements", "Frictional behavior", "High resolution sensors", "Interface behavior", "Orders of magnitude", "Sliding friction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061304397", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"57204310118": {"Name": "He H.", "AuthorID": "57204310118", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, City University of Hong Kong"}, "50061694500": {"Name": "Senetakis K.", "AuthorID": "50061694500", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, City University of Hong Kong"}, "12243933700": {"Name": "Coop M.R.", "AuthorID": "12243933700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
