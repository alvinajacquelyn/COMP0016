This study addresses this gap in our knowledge through analysis of data collected across six countries as part of a DSM-5 Field Trial of the Cultural Formulation Interview (CFI). At clinician discretion, individuals who accompanied patients to the clinic visit (i.e. patient companions) at the time the CFI was conducted were invited to participate in the cultural assessment and answer questions about their experience. The specific aims of this paper are (1) to describe patterns of participation of patient companions in the CFI across the six countries, and (2) to examine the comparative feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility of the CFI from companion perspectives through analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Among the 321 patient interviews, only 86 (at four of 12 sites) included companions, all of whom were family members or other relatives. The utility, feasibility and acceptability of the CFI were rated favourably by relatives, supported by qualitative analyses of debriefing interviews. Cross-site differences in frequency of accompaniment merit further study.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Ethnopsychology", "Family", "Humans", "Interview, Psychological", "Mental Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924420723", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7003470582": {"Name": "Hinton L.", "AuthorID": "7003470582", "AffiliationID": "60023317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine"}, "8870564400": {"Name": "Iosif A.M.", "AuthorID": "8870564400", "AffiliationID": "60023317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine"}, "56543607300": {"Name": "Avelar Y.", "AuthorID": "56543607300", "AffiliationID": "60023317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of California Davis School of Medicine"}, "21739366800": {"Name": "Aggarwal N.", "AuthorID": "21739366800", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "35513738600": {"Name": "Lewis-Fern\u00e1ndez R.", "AuthorID": "35513738600", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "55781847300": {"Name": "Boiler M.", "AuthorID": "55781847300", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "56542570200": {"Name": "Lam P.", "AuthorID": "56542570200", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "7404318008": {"Name": "Weiss M.", "AuthorID": "7404318008", "AffiliationID": "60023588, 60023146", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, University of Basel"}, "15758191900": {"Name": "Paralikar V.", "AuthorID": "15758191900", "AffiliationID": "60194976", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, KEM Hospital Research Centre"}, "7201691211": {"Name": "Deshpande S.", "AuthorID": "7201691211", "AffiliationID": "60002297, 60000137", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and De-Addiction Services, PGIMER-Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital"}, "57203069546": {"Name": "Jadhav S.", "AuthorID": "57203069546", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University of London"}, "6701462705": {"Name": "Ndetei D.", "AuthorID": "6701462705", "AffiliationID": "60068299, 60158104", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Nairobi and Africa Mental Health Foundation"}, "55647888400": {"Name": "Nicasio A.", "AuthorID": "55647888400", "AffiliationID": "60022144", "AffiliationName": "University of Central Florida, Department of Psychology"}}}
