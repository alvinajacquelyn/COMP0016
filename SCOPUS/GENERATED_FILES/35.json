However, prevalence studies provide important insights on factors associated with disease evolution as well as for healthcare resource allocation. This study aimed to investigate the distribution of prevalent NAPD cases in an urban area in France. The number of cases in each neighbourhood was modelled as a function of potential confounders and ecological variables, namely: migrant density, economic deprivation and social fragmentation. This was modelled using statistical models of increasing complexity: frequentist models (using Poisson and negative binomial regressions), and several Bayesian models. For each model, assumptions validity were checked and compared as to how this fitted to the data, in order to test for possible spatial variation in prevalence. Data showed significant overdispersion (invalidating the Poisson regression model) and residual autocorrelation (suggesting the need to use Bayesian models). The best Bayesian model was Leroux's model (i.e. a model with both strong correlation between neighbouring areas and weaker correlation between areas further apart), with economic deprivation as an explanatory variable (OR = 1.13, 95% CI [1.02-1.25]). In comparison with frequentist methods, the Bayesian model showed a better fit. The number of cases showed non-random spatial distribution and was linked to economic deprivation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Economics", "Female", "France", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Psychotic Disorders", "Spatial Analysis", "Topography, Medical", "Urban Population", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971328651", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56289107700": {"Name": "Pignon B.", "AuthorID": "56289107700", "AffiliationID": "60017724", "AffiliationName": "CHRU de Lille, P\u00f4le de Psychiatrie, H\u00f4pital Fontan"}, "57207726175": {"Name": "Schurhoff F.", "AuthorID": "57207726175", "AffiliationID": "60085092", "AffiliationName": "UPEC, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine"}, "56173270200": {"Name": "Baudin G.", "AuthorID": "56173270200", "AffiliationID": "60032530", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois-Rabelais de Tours"}, "57203832931": {"Name": "Ferchiou A.", "AuthorID": "57203832931", "AffiliationID": "60136209", "AffiliationName": "Fondation FondaMental"}, "7004906395": {"Name": "Saba G.", "AuthorID": "7004906395", "AffiliationID": "60136209", "AffiliationName": "Fondation FondaMental"}, "7005287140": {"Name": "Leboyer M.", "AuthorID": "7005287140", "AffiliationID": "60085092", "AffiliationName": "UPEC, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine"}, "7007174299": {"Name": "Szoke A.", "AuthorID": "7007174299", "AffiliationID": "60136209", "AffiliationName": "Fondation FondaMental"}, "57204623943": {"Name": "Richard J.R.", "AuthorID": "57204623943", "AffiliationID": "60136209", "AffiliationName": "Fondation FondaMental"}, "57218240440": {"Name": "Kirkbride J.B.", "AuthorID": "57218240440", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, UCL"}}}
