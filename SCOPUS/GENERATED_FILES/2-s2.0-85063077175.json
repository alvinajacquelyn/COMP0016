Mounting ecological and societal concerns are driving construction to \u2018go green\u2019. Green supply chain management offers the potential of a systemic approach to facilitate transformation of the sector. Research on green supply chain management in construction has been growing in recent times but to date has not been systematically brought together. A systematic literature review (SLR) is presented, applying the high standards of rigour and transparency required by the methodology. From an initial search result of 207 papers, 44 were included in the detailed analysis. The papers are described in terms of publication outlet, date of publication, geographic setting, methods used, tools and techniques, conceptual definition, the role of stakeholders and practical implications. The findings are synthesized to propose a categorization of approach and a comprehensive definition of green supply chain management in construction. An agenda for future research is outlined which emphasizes the need for an end-to-end perspective, engagement with the unique characteristics of the industry, a focus on the ultimate goals of environmental sustainability, and on gaps in practical guidance, use of insights from relevant theoretical perspectives, and expansion to include critical stances.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Construction industry", "Green supply chain management", "Sustainable supply chain management", "Systematic literature review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental sustainability", "Geographic setting", "Green supply chain management", "Practical guidance", "Sustainable supply chains", "Systematic literature review", "Systematic literature review (SLR)", "Tools and techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063077175", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"56829337100": {"Name": "Badi S.", "AuthorID": "56829337100", "AffiliationID": "60070792", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Business & Law, The British University in Dubai (BUiD)"}, "21733667800": {"Name": "Murtagh N.", "AuthorID": "21733667800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}}}
