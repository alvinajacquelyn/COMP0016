Intriguingly, organelles avoid clashing and entangling with each other in such limited space. Mitochondria form extensive networks constantly remodeled by fission and fusion. Here, we show that mitochondrial fission is triggered by mechanical forces. Mechano-stimulation of mitochondria - via encounter with motile intracellular pathogens, via external pressure applied by an atomic force microscope, or via cell migration across uneven microsurfaces - results in the recruitment of the mitochondrial fission machinery, and subsequent division. We propose that MFF, owing to affinity for narrow mitochondria, acts as a membrane-bound force sensor to recruit the fission machinery to mechanically strained sites. Thus, mitochondria adapt to the environment by sensing and responding to biomechanical cues. Our findings that mechanical triggers can be coupled to biochemical responses in membrane dynamics may explain how organelles orderly cohabit in the crowded cytoplasm.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cercopithecus aethiops", "Cytological Techniques", "Humans", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Stress, Mechanical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036566288", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55605392400": {"Name": "Helle S.", "AuthorID": "55605392400", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, ETH Zurich"}, "57198432842": {"Name": "Feng Q.", "AuthorID": "57198432842", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, ETH Zurich"}, "8316024600": {"Name": "Kornmann B.", "AuthorID": "8316024600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biochemistry, ETH Zurich"}, "57150877200": {"Name": "Aebersold M.", "AuthorID": "57150877200", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Institute for Biomedical Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "56556433700": {"Name": "Hirt L.", "AuthorID": "56556433700", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Institute for Biomedical Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "35366339100": {"Name": "Gr\u00fcter R.", "AuthorID": "35366339100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Institute for Biomedical Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "6603869741": {"Name": "Zambelli T.", "AuthorID": "6603869741", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Institute for Biomedical Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "57191172639": {"Name": "Vahid A.", "AuthorID": "57191172639", "AffiliationID": "60117987, 60006288, 60117993", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bionanoscience, Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology"}, "23978054200": {"Name": "Idema T.", "AuthorID": "23978054200", "AffiliationID": "60117987, 60006288, 60117993", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bionanoscience, Kavli Institute of Nanoscience, Delft University of Technology"}, "55623120800": {"Name": "Sirianni A.", "AuthorID": "55623120800", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Section of Microbiology, MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London"}, "6602332720": {"Name": "Mostowy S.", "AuthorID": "6602332720", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Section of Microbiology, MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London"}, "8639317700": {"Name": "Snedeker J.", "AuthorID": "8639317700", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomechanics, ETH Zurich"}, "23669259400": {"Name": "\u0160ari\u0107 A.", "AuthorID": "23669259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}}}
