Traditionally, anterior capsulotomy (AC) was an established procedure for treatment of patients with refractory OCD. Over recent decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has gained popularity. In this paper the authors review the published literature and compare the outcome of AC and DBS targeting of the area of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Patients in published cases were grouped according to whether they received AC or DBS and according to their preoperative scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), and then separated according to outcome measures: remission (YBOCS score < 8); response (\u2265 35% improvement in YBOCS score); nonresponse (< 35% improvement in YBOCS score); and unfavorable (i.e., worsening of the baseline YBOCS score). Twenty studies were identified reporting on 170 patients; 62 patients underwent DBS of the VC/VS or the NAcc (mean age 38 years, follow-up 19 months, baseline YBOCS score of 33), and 108 patients underwent AC (mean age 36 years, follow-up 61 months, baseline YBOCS score of 30). In patients treated with DBS there was a 40% decrease in YBOCS score, compared with a 51% decrease for those who underwent AC (p = 0.004). Patients who underwent AC were 9% more likely to go into remission than patients treated with DBS (p = 0.02). No difference in complication rates was noted. Anterior capsulotomy is an efficient procedure for refractory OCD. Deep brain stimulation in the VC/VS and NAcc area is an emerging and promising therapy. The current popularity of DBS over ablative surgery for OCD is not due to nonefficacy of AC, but possibly because DBS is perceived as more acceptable by clinicians and patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anterior capsulotomy", "Deep brain stimulation", "Functional neurosurgery", "Obsessive-compulsive disorder", "Psychosurgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Deep Brain Stimulation", "Frontal Lobe", "Humans", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder", "Thalamus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936816674", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55506180800": {"Name": "Pepper J.", "AuthorID": "55506180800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Victor Horsley Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
