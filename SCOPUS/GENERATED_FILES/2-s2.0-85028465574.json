Yet the underlying brain mechanisms are currently not well understood. Whole-brain computational modeling was used to disclose the effects of DBS during resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in ten patients with Parkinson's disease. Specifically, we explored the local and global impact that DBS has in creating asynchronous, stable or critical oscillatory conditions using a supercritical bifurcation model. We found that DBS shifts global brain dynamics of patients towards a Healthy regime. This effect was more pronounced in very specific brain areas such as the thalamus, globus pallidus and orbitofrontal regions of the right hemisphere (with the left hemisphere not analyzed given artifacts arising from the electrode lead). Global aspects of integration and synchronization were also rebalanced. Empirically, we found higher communicability and coherence brain measures during DBS-ON compared to DBS-OFF. Finally, using our model as a framework, artificial in silico DBS was applied to find potential alternative target areas for stimulation and whole-brain rebalancing. These results offer important insights into the underlying large-scale effects of DBS as well as in finding novel stimulation targets, which may offer a route to more efficacious treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Brain", "Case-Control Studies", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028465574", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55082182200": {"Name": "Saenger V.M.", "AuthorID": "55082182200", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Center for Brain and Cognition, Computational Neuroscience Group, Department of Information and Communication Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "7006674531": {"Name": "Deco G.", "AuthorID": "7006674531", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University"}, "50961268900": {"Name": "Kahan J.", "AuthorID": "50961268900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003880315": {"Name": "Limousin P.", "AuthorID": "7003880315", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7102677271": {"Name": "Aziz T.Z.", "AuthorID": "7102677271", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7404024088": {"Name": "Green A.L.", "AuthorID": "7404024088", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "55189926000": {"Name": "Van Hartevelt T.J.", "AuthorID": "55189926000", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University, Aarhus"}, "37664694800": {"Name": "Cabral J.", "AuthorID": "37664694800", "AffiliationID": "60094395, 60020475", "AffiliationName": "Life and Health Sciences Research Institute (ICVS), School of Health Sciences, University of Minho"}, "57186656500": {"Name": "Stevner A.B.A.", "AuthorID": "57186656500", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University, Aarhus"}, "36476152900": {"Name": "Fernandes H.M.", "AuthorID": "36476152900", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University, Aarhus"}, "6701378751": {"Name": "Kringelbach M.L.", "AuthorID": "6701378751", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Center for Music in the Brain, Aarhus University, Aarhus"}, "35722647600": {"Name": "Mancini L.", "AuthorID": "35722647600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35316314600": {"Name": "Thornton J.", "AuthorID": "35316314600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55759915300": {"Name": "Marques P.", "AuthorID": "55759915300", "AffiliationID": "112949635", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Academic Center"}, "7003438440": {"Name": "Sousa N.", "AuthorID": "7003438440", "AffiliationID": "112949635", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Academic Center"}}}
