The computed electronic structure of the tetragonal phase shows an antiferro-orbital ordering on V sites and a ferrimagnetic ground state (the spins on V and Mn are antialigned). These results are in good agreement with the previous theoretical result obtained from the local-density approximation + U methods [S. Sarkar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 216405 (2009)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.102.216405]. Moreover, the electronic structure, especially the projected density of states of the cubic phase, has been predicted with good agreement with the recent soft x-ray spectroscopy experiment. Similar to the tetragonal phase, the spins on V and Mn in the cubic structure favor a ferrimagnetic configuration. Most interesting is that the computed charge densities of the spin-carrying orbitals on V in the cubic phase show an exotic orbital ordering, i.e., a ferro-orbital ordering along [110] but an antiferro-orbital ordering along [1\u00af10].", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929600882", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57192650480": {"Name": "Wu W.", "AuthorID": "57192650480", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
