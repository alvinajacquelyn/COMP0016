Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis. Setting: Eleven maternity units participating in the PARROT stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial. Population: Women presenting with suspected pre-eclampsia between 20+0 and 36+6 weeks\u2019 gestation. Methods: Monte Carlo simulation utilising resource use data and maternal adverse outcomes. Main outcome measures: Cost per maternal adverse outcome prevented. Results: Clinical care with PlGF testing costs less than current standard practice and resulted in fewer maternal adverse outcomes. There is a total cost-saving of UK\u00a3149 per patient tested, when including the cost of the test. This represents a potential cost-saving of UK\u00a32,891,196 each year across the NHS in England. Conclusions: Clinical care with PlGF testing is associated with the potential for cost-savings per participant tested when compared with current practice via a reduction in outpatient attendances, and improves maternal outcomes. This economic analysis supports a role for implementation of PlGF testing in antenatal services for the assessment of women with suspected pre-eclampsia.
