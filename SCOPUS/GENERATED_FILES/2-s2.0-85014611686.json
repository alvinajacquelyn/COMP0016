Touchless sensing products are being launched across consumer electronics, home, automotive and healthcare industries. Recent advances in haptics and display technologies has meant that interaction designers can also provide users with tactile feedback in mid-air AND display visual elements wherever the user needs them without in anyway instrumenting the user. The overarching goal of this workshop is to bring together a group of researchers spanning across multiple facets of exploring interactions with mid-air systems to discuss, explore, and outline research challenges for this novel area. We are especially interested in exploring how novel display and haptic technology provide users with more compelling and immersive experiences without instrumenting them in anyway.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Air Systems", "Display technologies", "Haptic technology", "Healthcare industry", "Research challenges", "Tactile feedback", "Touchless", "Visual elements"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014611686", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "University of Sussex, Flamer"}, "23669363200": {"Name": "Seah S.", "AuthorID": "23669363200", "AffiliationID": "60115314", "AffiliationName": "Ultrahaptics Ltd., Engine Shed, Station Approach"}, "55179460500": {"Name": "Corenthy L.", "AuthorID": "55179460500", "AffiliationID": "60115314", "AffiliationName": "Ultrahaptics Ltd., Engine Shed, Station Approach"}, "7102272885": {"Name": "Shinoda H.", "AuthorID": "7102272885", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "University of Tokyo"}, "17345723500": {"Name": "Hoggan E.", "AuthorID": "17345723500", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Aalto Science Institute"}}}
