This deficiency contributes functionally to the fibroproliferative state, however the mechanisms responsible are incompletely understood. In the present study, we examined whether the reduced level of COX-2 mRNA expression observed in fibrotic lung fibroblasts is regulated epigenetically. The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5AZA) restored COX-2 mRNA expression by fibrotic lung fibroblasts dose dependently. Functionally, this resulted in normalization of fibroblast phenotype in terms of PGE2 production, collagen mRNA expression and sensitivity to apoptosis. COX-2 methylation assessed by bisulfite sequencing and methylation microarrays was not different in fibrotic fibroblasts compared with controls. However, further analysis of the methylation array data identified a transcriptional regulator, chromosome 8 open reading frame 4 (thyroid cancer protein 1, TC-1) (c8orf4), which is hypermethylated and down-regulated in fibrotic fibroblasts compared with controls. siRNA knockdown of c8orf4 in control fibroblasts down-regulated COX-2 and PGE2 production generating a phenotype similar to that observed in fibrotic lung fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that c8orf4 regulates COX-2 expression in lung fibroblasts through binding of the proximal promoter. We conclude that the decreased capacity of fibrotic lung fibroblasts to up-regulate COX-2 expression and COX-2-derived PGE2 synthesis is due to an indirect epigenetic mechanism involving hypermethylation of the transcriptional regulator, c8orf4.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyclooxygenase-2", "DNA methylation", "Fibroblast", "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "Prostaglandin E2", "Systemic sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Binding Sites", "Case-Control Studies", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cyclooxygenase 2", "Dinoprostone", "DNA Methylation", "DNA Modification Methylases", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Down-Regulation", "Enzyme Inhibitors", "Epigenesis, Genetic", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Genotype", "Humans", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Proteins", "Phenotype", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Pulmonary Fibrosis", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Messenger", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Transcription, Genetic", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973519350", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8848841800": {"Name": "Evans I.C.", "AuthorID": "8848841800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Building, University College London"}, "57143512600": {"Name": "Barnes J.L.", "AuthorID": "57143512600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Building, University College London"}, "57213367144": {"Name": "Garner I.M.", "AuthorID": "57213367144", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Building, University College London"}, "57189630390": {"Name": "Pearce D.R.", "AuthorID": "57189630390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Building, University College London"}, "56799189700": {"Name": "Maher T.M.", "AuthorID": "56799189700", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Unit and Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7005878656": {"Name": "McAnulty R.J.", "AuthorID": "7005878656", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Building, University College London"}, "6602708198": {"Name": "Renzoni E.A.", "AuthorID": "6602708198", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Unit and Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Unit and Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "6602460726": {"Name": "Shiwen X.", "AuthorID": "6602460726", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "57203195982": {"Name": "Abraham D.J.", "AuthorID": "57203195982", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7201921559": {"Name": "Laurent G.J.", "AuthorID": "7201921559", "AffiliationID": "60087991, 60005202, 60009834, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, School of Medicine and Pharmacology, University of Western Australia, Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research"}}}
