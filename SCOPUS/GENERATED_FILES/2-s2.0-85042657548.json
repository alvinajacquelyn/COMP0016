Nondemented subjects (62 with subjective cognitive decline; 160 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI); age = 68 \u00b1 8 years; Mini\u2013Mental State Examination (MMSE) = 28 \u00b1 2.4) were selected from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort when they had abnormal amyloid in CSF (<640 pg/mL). Networks were extracted from gray matter structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 9 parameters were calculated. Cox proportional hazards models were used to test associations between each connectivity predictor and rate of progression to MCI or dementia. After a median time of 2.2 years, 122 (55%) subjects showed clinical progression. Lower network parameter values were associated with increased risk for progression, with the strongest hazard ratio of 0.29 for clustering (95% confidence interval = 0.12\u20130.70; p < 0.01). Results remained after correcting for tau, hippocampal volume, and MMSE scores. Our results suggest that at predementia stages, gray matter network parameters may have use to identify subjects who will show fast clinical progression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical progression", "Gray matter networks", "Predementia Alzheimer's disease", "Prognosis", "Single subject"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid", "Biomarkers", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Status and Dementia Tests", "Middle Aged", "Organ Size", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042657548", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57204782423": {"Name": "Tijms B.M.", "AuthorID": "57204782423", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, VUmc, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "57188682958": {"Name": "ten Kate M.", "AuthorID": "57188682958", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, VUmc, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "21833578700": {"Name": "Gouw A.A.", "AuthorID": "21833578700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology/MEG Center, VUmc, Amsterdam, Neuroscience Campus"}, "55237599500": {"Name": "Verfaillie S.", "AuthorID": "55237599500", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, VUmc, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, VUmc, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "van der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VUmc, Amsterdam, Neuroscience Campus"}, "57193431215": {"Name": "Borta A.", "AuthorID": "57193431215", "AffiliationID": "60011807", "AffiliationName": "Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH Co KG, Ingelheim am Rhein"}, "6701704380": {"Name": "Teunissen C.E.", "AuthorID": "6701704380", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Laboratory and Biobank, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology & Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}}}
