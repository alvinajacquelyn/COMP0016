SAP promotes amyloid fibril formation in vitro, contributes to persistence of amyloid in vivo and is also itself directly toxic to cerebral neurons. We therefore developed (R)-1-[6-[(R)-2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-l-yl]-6-oxo-hexanoyl]pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (CPHPC), a drug that removes SAP from the blood, and thereby also from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in patients with AD. Here we report that, after introduction of transgenic human SAP expression in the TASTPM double transgenic mouse model of AD, all the amyloid deposits contained human SAP. Depletion of circulating human SAP by CPHPC administration in these mice removed all detectable human SAP from both the intracerebral and cerebrovascular amyloid. The demonstration that removal of SAP from the blood and CSF also removes it from these amyloid deposits crucially validates the strategy of the forthcoming 'Depletion of serum amyloid P component in Alzheimer's disease (DESPIAD)' clinical trial of CPHPC. The results also strongly support clinical testing of CPHPC in patients with CAA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "A\u03b2amyloid", "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "CPHPC", "Serum amyloid P component"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Serum Amyloid P-Component"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962316657", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6602411357": {"Name": "Al-Shawi R.", "AuthorID": "6602411357", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7003350511": {"Name": "Tennent G.", "AuthorID": "7003350511", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "57197054900": {"Name": "Millar D.", "AuthorID": "57197054900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "57210462155": {"Name": "Simons J.", "AuthorID": "57210462155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "56848974700": {"Name": "Pepys M.", "AuthorID": "56848974700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "35765932500": {"Name": "Richard-Londt A.", "AuthorID": "35765932500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006643850": {"Name": "Brandner S.", "AuthorID": "7006643850", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Group, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
