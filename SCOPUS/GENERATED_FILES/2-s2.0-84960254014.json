Drawing from two longitudinal, interview-based qualitative studies with young people living with HIV (aged 10\u201324) in five different countries in low and high income settings, we present data regarding disclosure and information about HIV in the clinic. The article highlights the limits of discussions framing disclosure and patient literacy, and young people\u2019s reluctance to voice their adherence difficulties in the context of their relationships with clinical care teams. We suggest that a clinician-initiated, explicit acknowledgment of the social and practical hurdles of daily adherence for young people would aid a more transparent conversation and encourage young people to disclose missed doses and other problems they may be facing with their treatment. This may help to reduce health harms and poor adherence in the longer-term.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adherence", "Adolescents", "clinical care", "communication", "disclosure", "qualitative"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960254014", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"23093100300": {"Name": "Bernays S.", "AuthorID": "23093100300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "23973273100": {"Name": "Paparini S.", "AuthorID": "23973273100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social and Environmental Health Research, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University of College London"}, "7005429371": {"Name": "Seeley J.", "AuthorID": "7005429371", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}}}
