To drive this effort, we completed a globally representative research prioritisation exercise using an adapted version of the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative method. We elicited 863 research questions from 201 participants and consolidated these questions into 59 thematic research avenues, which were scored anonymously by 162 researchers and stakeholders from 39 countries according to five criteria. Six of the top ten research priorities were focused on prevention, identification, and reduction of dementia risk, and on delivery and quality of care for people with dementia and their carers. Other priorities related to diagnosis, biomarkers, treatment development, basic research into disease mechanisms, and public awareness and understanding of dementia. Research priorities identified by this systematic international process should be mapped onto the global dementia research landscape to identify crucial gaps and inform and motivate policy makers, funders, and researchers to support and conduct research to reduce the global burden of dementia. Efforts are needed by all stakeholders, including WHO, WHO Member States, and civil society, to continuously monitor research investments and progress, through international platforms such as a Global Dementia Observatory. With established research priorities, an opportunity now exists to translate the call for action into a global dementia action plan to reduce the global burden of dementia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Research", "Dementia", "Global Health", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992609829", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56555967600": {"Name": "Shah H.", "AuthorID": "56555967600", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University"}, "22133359100": {"Name": "Albanese E.", "AuthorID": "22133359100", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Geneva"}, "57188997376": {"Name": "Duggan C.", "AuthorID": "57188997376", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "57215382425": {"Name": "Rudan I.", "AuthorID": "57215382425", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Research and WHO Collaborating Centre for Population Health Research and Training, The Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "8945569100": {"Name": "Chan K.Y.", "AuthorID": "8945569100", "AffiliationID": "60118547, 60026553", "AffiliationName": "Nossal Institute for Global Health, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne"}, "35500660200": {"Name": "Langa K.M.", "AuthorID": "35500660200", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, VA Center for Clinical Management Research, Institute for Social Research, Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, University of Michigan"}, "35472816700": {"Name": "Carrillo M.C.", "AuthorID": "35472816700", "AffiliationID": "60031837", "AffiliationName": "Medical and Scientific Relations Division, Alzheimer's Association"}, "7102670847": {"Name": "Snyder H.M.", "AuthorID": "7102670847", "AffiliationID": "60031837", "AffiliationName": "Medical and Scientific Relations Division, Alzheimer's Association"}, "7005131160": {"Name": "Joanette Y.", "AuthorID": "7005131160", "AffiliationID": "116581405", "AffiliationName": "World Dementia Council"}, "55507271700": {"Name": "Prince M.", "AuthorID": "55507271700", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60177638", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Mental Health, Health Service and Population Research Department, King's College London"}, "7103182857": {"Name": "Rossor M.", "AuthorID": "7103182857", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegeneration, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35430382900": {"Name": "Saxena S.", "AuthorID": "35430382900", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, World Health Organization"}, "6603129199": {"Name": "Dua T.", "AuthorID": "6603129199", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, World Health Organization"}, "7101961665": {"Name": "Sperling R.", "AuthorID": "7101961665", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746, 60029929", "AffiliationName": "Center for Alzheimer Research and Treatment, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "35410779700": {"Name": "Varghese M.", "AuthorID": "35410779700", "AffiliationID": "60016175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences"}, "7501749505": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "7501749505", "AffiliationID": "60121976", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Care and Research Center, Peking University Institute of Mental Health, Beijing Municipal Key Laboratory for Translational Research on Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia, National Clinical Research Center for Mental Disorders, Peking University Sixth Hospital"}, "25523027400": {"Name": "Wortmann M.", "AuthorID": "25523027400", "AffiliationID": "109601438", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer's Disease International"}}}
