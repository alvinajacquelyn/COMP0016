Like the well-known octahedral tilts of conventional perovskites, shifts also preserve the octahedral coordination geometry of the B-site cation in molecular perovskites, and so are predisposed to influencing the low-energy dynamics and displacive phase transitions of these topical systems. We present a qualitative overview of the interplay between shift activation and crystal symmetry breaking, and introduce a generalised terminology to allow characterisation of simple shift distortions, drawing analogy to the \"Glazer notation\" for octahedral tilts. We apply our approach to the interpretation of a representative selection of azide and formate perovskite structures, and discuss the implications for functional exploitation of shift degrees of freedom in negative thermal expansion materials and hybrid ferroelectrics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021779413", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57190731109": {"Name": "Bostr\u00f6m H.", "AuthorID": "57190731109", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "56440608300": {"Name": "Hill J.", "AuthorID": "56440608300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "10043396400": {"Name": "Goodwin A.", "AuthorID": "10043396400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
