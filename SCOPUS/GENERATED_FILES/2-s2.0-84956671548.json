The mechanisms that underlie MDM4 upregulation in cancer cells are largely unknown. Here, we have shown that this key oncogenic event mainly depends on a specific alternative splicing switch. We determined that while a nonsense-mediated, decay-targeted isoform of MDM4 (MDM4-S) is produced in normal adult tissues as a result of exon 6 skipping, enhanced exon 6 inclusion leads to expression of full-length MDM4 in a large number of human cancers. Although this alternative splicing event is likely regulated by multiple splicing factors, we identified the SRSF3 oncoprotein as a key enhancer of exon 6 inclusion. In multiple human melanoma cell lines and in melanoma patient- derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated (ASO-mediated) skipping of exon 6 decreased MDM4 abundance, inhibited melanoma growth, and enhanced sensitivity to MAPK-targeting therapeutics. Additionally, ASO-based MDM4 targeting reduced diffuse large B cell lymphoma PDX growth. As full-length MDM4 is enhanced in multiple human tumors, our data indicate that this strategy is applicable to a wide range of tumor types. We conclude that enhanced MDM4 exon 6 inclusion is a common oncogenic event and has potential as a clinically compatible therapeutic target.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Exons", "Humans", "Melanoma", "Mice", "Nuclear Proteins", "Oligonucleotides, Antisense", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "RNA-Binding Proteins", "Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956671548", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"8892805400": {"Name": "Dewaele M.", "AuthorID": "8892805400", "AffiliationID": "60121261, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven"}, "56473559100": {"Name": "Willekens K.", "AuthorID": "56473559100", "AffiliationID": "60121261, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven"}, "24073494400": {"Name": "Rambow F.", "AuthorID": "24073494400", "AffiliationID": "60121261, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven"}, "36098259100": {"Name": "Rogiers A.", "AuthorID": "36098259100", "AffiliationID": "60121261, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven"}, "55666907600": {"Name": "Marine J.C.", "AuthorID": "55666907600", "AffiliationID": "60121261, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven"}, "8866890800": {"Name": "Fiers M.", "AuthorID": "8866890800", "AffiliationID": "60121261, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Molecular Cancer Biology, Department of Human Genetics, KU Leuven"}, "56532055700": {"Name": "Tabaglio T.", "AuthorID": "56532055700", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "36458051100": {"Name": "Bezzi M.", "AuthorID": "36458051100", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "55934457400": {"Name": "Teo S.X.", "AuthorID": "55934457400", "AffiliationID": "60021981, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Genetics and Therapeutics, Laboratory of Methyltransferases in Development and Disease, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "54884283400": {"Name": "Low D.H.P.", "AuthorID": "54884283400", "AffiliationID": "60021981, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Genetics and Therapeutics, Laboratory of Methyltransferases in Development and Disease, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "12242691600": {"Name": "Koh C.M.", "AuthorID": "12242691600", "AffiliationID": "60021981, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Genetics and Therapeutics, Laboratory of Methyltransferases in Development and Disease, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology (IMCB), ASTAR (Agency for Science, Technology and Research)"}, "6603935020": {"Name": "Guccione E.", "AuthorID": "6603935020", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "36896901600": {"Name": "Radaelli E.", "AuthorID": "36896901600", "AffiliationID": "60025063, 60019793", "AffiliationName": "Mouse Histopathology Core Facility, VIB Center for the Biology of Disease, KU Leuven"}, "6602920076": {"Name": "Al-Haddawi M.", "AuthorID": "6602920076", "AffiliationID": "60021981", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Molecular Pathology Laboratory, IMCB"}, "7403366687": {"Name": "Tan S.Y.", "AuthorID": "7403366687", "AffiliationID": "60017958", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital"}, "56611558600": {"Name": "Hermans E.", "AuthorID": "56611558600", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Gynaecologische Oncologie, UZ Leuven"}, "7004842517": {"Name": "Amant F.", "AuthorID": "7004842517", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Gynecologic Oncology Amsterdam (CGOA), Antoni Van Leeuwenhoek -
