These anxieties often occur in the absence of physical disorder and have previously been recognized as obsessive anxieties reflecting a preoccupation with loss of bowel/bladder control. Motivated by our observations of the non-trivial occurrence of such anxieties in our clinical practice we sought to fill a gap in the current understanding of bowel/bladder-control anxieties. Method: Eligible participants completed an internet survey. Results: Bowel/bladder-control anxieties (n = 140) tended to emerge in the mid to late 20s and were associated with high levels of avoidance and functional impairment. There was a high prevalence of panic attacks (78%); these were especially prevalent among those with bowel-control anxiety. Of those with panic attacks, 62% indicated that their main concern was being incontinent during a panic attack. Significantly, a proportion of respondents (~16%) reported actually being incontinent during a panic attack. Seventy percent of participants reported intrusive imagery related to loss of bowel/bladder control. Intrusion-related distress was correlated with agoraphobic avoidance and general role impairment. Some differences were noted between those with predominantly bowel-, predominantly bladder-and those with both bowel and bladder-control anxieties. Conclusion: This preliminary characterization indicates that even in a non-treatment seeking community sample, bowel/bladder-control anxieties are associated with high levels of distress and impairment. Further careful characterization of these anxieties will clarify their phenomenology and help us develop or modify treatment protocols in a way that takes account of any special characteristics of such viscerally-centred phobic syndromes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "anxiety disorders", "bladder-control anxiety", "bowel-control anxiety", "panic disorder", "panic disorder with agoraphobia", "phobia", "visceral sensations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety Disorders", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Fecal Incontinence", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Phobic Disorders", "Psychometrics", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Urinary Incontinence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921982510", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"7003707171": {"Name": "Kamboj S.K.", "AuthorID": "7003707171", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}, "55774098100": {"Name": "Langhoff C.", "AuthorID": "55774098100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}, "55754895100": {"Name": "Pajak R.", "AuthorID": "55754895100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}, "57191374646": {"Name": "Lau-Zhu A.", "AuthorID": "57191374646", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}, "57220476420": {"Name": "Chevalier A.", "AuthorID": "57220476420", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}, "56117393800": {"Name": "Watson S.", "AuthorID": "56117393800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology"}}}
