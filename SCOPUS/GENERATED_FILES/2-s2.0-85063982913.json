In this work, we present the promotional effect of Pd on this catalyst and investigate structure-performance relationships using in situ X-ray spectroscopy, ex situ characterization, and microkinetic modeling. Catalysts were synthesized with varying In:Pd ratios (1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 0:1) and tested for methanol synthesis from CO2/H2 at 40 bar and 300 \u00b0C. In:Pd(2:1)/SiO2 shows the highest activity (5.1 \u03bcmol MeOH/gInPds) and selectivity toward methanol (61%). While all bimetallic catalysts had enhanced catalytic performance, characterization reveals methanol synthesis was maximized when the catalyst contained both In-Pd intermetallic compounds and an indium oxide phase. Experimental results and density functional theory suggest the active phase arises from a synergy between the indium oxide phase and a bimetallic In-Pd particle with a surface enrichment of indium. We show that the promotion observed in the In-Pd system is extendable to non precious metal containing binary systems, in particular In-Ni, which displayed similar composition-activity trends to the In-Pd system. Both palladium and nickel were found to form bimetallic catalysts with enhanced methanol activity and selectivity relative to that of indium oxide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bimetallic", "CO2 utilization", "in situ characterization", "In-Ni", "In-Pd", "In2O3", "intermetallic", "methanol synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["bimetallic", "Bimetallic catalysts", "Catalytic performance", "In-situ characterization", "In2O3", "Methanol synthesis", "Microkinetic modeling", "Structure performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063982913", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57195135776": {"Name": "Snider J.L.", "AuthorID": "57195135776", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "57204424003": {"Name": "Streibel V.", "AuthorID": "57204424003", "AffiliationID": "60025590", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "57197748960": {"Name": "Hubert M.A.", "AuthorID": "57197748960", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "57057651100": {"Name": "Choksi T.S.", "AuthorID": "57057651100", "AffiliationID": "60025590", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "57195597522": {"Name": "Valle E.", "AuthorID": "57195597522", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "36905637900": {"Name": "Upham D.C.", "AuthorID": "36905637900", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, Department of Chemical Engineering, Stanford University"}, "56015522300": {"Name": "Duyar M.S.", "AuthorID": "56015522300", "AffiliationID": "60025590", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "56878389200": {"Name": "Gallo A.", "AuthorID": "56878389200", "AffiliationID": "60025590", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "6603398169": {"Name": "Jaramillo T.F.", "AuthorID": "6603398169", "AffiliationID": "60025590", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "55763214500": {"Name": "Schumann J.", "AuthorID": "55763214500", "AffiliationID": "60025590", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}, "55991126900": {"Name": "Abild-Pedersen F.", "AuthorID": "55991126900", "AffiliationID": "60025590", "AffiliationName": "SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory"}}}
