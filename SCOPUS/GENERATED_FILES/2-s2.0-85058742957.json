Here we report that pathological tau accumulation takes place predominantly in excitatory neurons compared to inhibitory neurons, not only in the entorhinal cortex, a brain region affected in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but also in areas affected later by the disease. By analyzing RNA transcripts from single-nucleus RNA datasets, we identified a specific tau homeostasis signature of genes differentially expressed in excitatory compared to inhibitory neurons. One of the genes, BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3), a facilitator of autophagy, was identified as a hub, or master regulator, gene. We verified that reducing BAG3 levels in primary neurons exacerbated pathological tau accumulation, whereas BAG3 overexpression attenuated it. These results define a tau homeostasis signature that underlies the cellular and regional vulnerability of excitatory neurons to tau pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins", "Brain", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neurons", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058742957", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57189847655": {"Name": "Fu H.", "AuthorID": "57189847655", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Chronic Brain Injury, Discovery Themes, The Ohio State University"}, "57205138093": {"Name": "Nakano Y.", "AuthorID": "57205138093", "AffiliationID": "100353140", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the Aging Brain"}, "57205136261": {"Name": "Villegas N.C.H.", "AuthorID": "57205136261", "AffiliationID": "100353140", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the Aging Brain"}, "57205136190": {"Name": "Cauhy P.V.M.", "AuthorID": "57205136190", "AffiliationID": "60015104", "AffiliationName": "Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia"}, "55822687900": {"Name": "Lassus B.A.", "AuthorID": "55822687900", "AffiliationID": "100353140", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the Aging Brain"}, "57205136720": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "57205136720", "AffiliationID": "100353140", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the Aging Brain"}, "57220593139": {"Name": "Fowler S.L.", "AuthorID": "57220593139", "AffiliationID": "100353140", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the Aging Brain"}, "23967665700": {"Name": "Figueroa H.Y.", "AuthorID": "23967665700", "AffiliationID": "100353140", "AffiliationName": "Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer\u2019s Disease and the Aging Brain"}, "13604678100": {"Name": "Huey E.D.", "AuthorID": "13604678100", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology, Columbia University"}, "35393105600": {"Name": "Duff K.E.", "AuthorID": "35393105600", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "Division of Integrative Neuroscience, New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "57204147346": {"Name": "Possenti A.", "AuthorID": "57204147346", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57189027520": {"Name": "Freer R.", "AuthorID": "57189027520", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7007094071": {"Name": "Vendruscolo M.", "AuthorID": "7007094071", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Misfolding Diseases, Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57195231820": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "57195231820", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Rochester"}, "7405720496": {"Name": "Johnson G.V.W.", "AuthorID": "7405720496", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Rochester"}}}
