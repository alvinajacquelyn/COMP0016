They are involved in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in clinically important pathogens. Although the ARGs are common in the oral cavity the association of integrons and antibiotic resistance has not been reported there. In this work, a PCR-based approach was used to investigate the presence of integrons and associated gene cassettes in human oral metagenomic DNA obtained from both the UK and Bangladesh. We identified a diverse array of gene cassettes containing ORFs predicted to confer antimicrobial resistance and other adaptive traits. The predicted proteins include a putative streptogramin A O-acetyltransferase, a bleomycin binding protein, cof-like hydrolase, competence and motility related proteins. This is the first study detecting integron gene cassettes directly from oral metagenomic DNA samples. The predicted proteins are likely to carry out a multitude of functions; however, the function of the majority is yet unknown.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacterial Proteins", "Bangladesh", "DNA, Bacterial", "Drug Resistance, Microbial", "Female", "Genes, Bacterial", "Humans", "Integrons", "Male", "Metagenome", "Microbiota", "Middle Aged", "Open Reading Frames", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Saliva", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975883814", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189907402": {"Name": "Tansirichaiya S.", "AuthorID": "57189907402", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "55312558500": {"Name": "Rahman M.A.", "AuthorID": "55312558500", "AffiliationID": "60020210", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, University of Rajshahi"}, "57189903307": {"Name": "Antepowicz A.", "AuthorID": "57189903307", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Gene Medicine Research Group, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7003643625": {"Name": "Mullany P.", "AuthorID": "7003643625", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "55464768800": {"Name": "Roberts A.P.", "AuthorID": "55464768800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
