The semi-analytical solutions obtained proved to be accurate when compared to numerical solution methods. These solutions were integrated into a multisection model with split-steps for mode dispersion and mode coupling. Simulations using this model matched the analytical predictions for the statistics of group-delays in few-mode fiber links, considering different coupling regimes with and without mode delay management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Few-mode fiber", "linear mode coupling", "mode-division multiplexing", "multimode fiber"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytical predictions", "Delay management", "Few-mode fibers", "Linear differential equation", "Linear modes", "Mode-division multiplexing", "Numerical solution method", "Semi-analytical solution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028865754", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"34881593800": {"Name": "Ferreira F.M.", "AuthorID": "34881593800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science"}, "57191035971": {"Name": "Costa C.S.", "AuthorID": "57191035971", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science"}, "55372527400": {"Name": "Sygletos S.", "AuthorID": "55372527400", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science"}, "7201547136": {"Name": "Ellis A.D.", "AuthorID": "7201547136", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, School of Engineering and Applied Science"}}}
