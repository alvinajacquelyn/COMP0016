In model (A) the interface feels a bulk term of random fields while in model (B) the disorder enters through the potential acting on the gradients. We assume a general distribution on the disorder with uniformly-bounded finite second moments. It is well known that for gradient models without disorder there are no Gibbs measures in infinite volume in dimension $$d = 2$$d=2, while there are shift-invariant gradient Gibbs measures describing an infinite-volume distribution for the gradients of the field, as was shown by Funaki and Spohn (Commun Math Phys 185:1\u201336, 1997). Van Enter and K\u00fclske proved in (Ann Appl Probab 18(1):109\u2013119, 2008) that adding a disorder term as in model (A) prohibits the existence of such gradient Gibbs measures for general interaction potentials in $$d = 2$$d=2. In Cotar and K\u00fclske (Ann Appl Probab 22(5):1650\u20131692, 2012) we proved the existence of shift-covariant random gradient Gibbs measures for model (A) when $$d\\ge 3$$d\u22653, the disorder is i.i.d and has mean zero, and for model (B) when $$d\\ge 1$$d\u22651 and the disorder has a stationary distribution. In the present paper, we prove existence and uniqueness of shift-covariant random gradient Gibbs measures with a given expected tilt$$u\\in {\\mathbb R}^{d}$$u\u2208Rd and with the corresponding annealed measure being ergodic: for model (A) when $$d\\ge 3$$d\u22653 and the disordered random fields are i.i.d. and symmetrically-distributed, and for model (B) when $$d\\ge 1$$d\u22651 and for any stationary disorder-dependence structure. We also compute for both models for any gradient Gibbs measure constructed as in Cotar and K\u00fclske (Ann Appl Probab 22(5):1650\u20131692, 2012), when the disorder is i.i.d. and its distribution satisfies a Poincar\u00e9 inequality assumption, the optimal decay of covariances with respect to the averaged-over-the-disorder gradient Gibbs measure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decay of covariances", "Disordered systems", "Gaussian Free Field", "Gradient Gibbs measure with disorder", "Poincar\u00e9 inequality", "Random conductance model", "Random interfaces", "Random walk representation", "Rotator model", "Stochastic homogenization", "Uniqueness of gradient Gibbs measures with disorder"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939271840", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"24485082800": {"Name": "Cotar C.", "AuthorID": "24485082800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Science Department, University College London"}, "6603522967": {"Name": "K\u00fclske C.", "AuthorID": "6603522967", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Mathematik, Ruhr-University of Bochum"}}}
