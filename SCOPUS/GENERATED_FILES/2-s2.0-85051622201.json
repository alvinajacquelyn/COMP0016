We find robust evidence that pupils in single-sex schools outperform their counterparts in coed schools, which could be due to single-sex peers in school and classroom, or unobservable school-level covariates. Focusing on switching schools, we find that the conversion of the pupil gender type from single-sex to coed leads to worse academic outcomes for both boys and girls, conditional on school fixed effects and time-varying observables. While for boys, the negative effect is largely driven by exposure to mixed-gender peers at school-level, it is class-level exposure to mixed-gender peers that explains this disadvantage for girls.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gender", "Random assignment", "School inputs", "Single sex schools"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051622201", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"7004410022": {"Name": "Dustmann C.", "AuthorID": "7004410022", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "55425266900": {"Name": "Ku H.", "AuthorID": "55425266900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "56090944700": {"Name": "Kwak D.", "AuthorID": "56090944700", "AffiliationID": "60005273", "AffiliationName": "Asiatic Research Institute, Korea University"}}}
