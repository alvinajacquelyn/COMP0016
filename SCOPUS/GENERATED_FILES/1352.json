As the loss of vision is directly the result of the loss of retinal cells, effective cell replacement through stem-cell-based therapies may have the potential to treat a great number of retinal diseases whatever their underlying etiology. The eye is an ideal organ to develop cell therapies as it is immune privileged, and modern surgical techniques enable precise delivery of cells to the retina. Furthermore, a range of noninvasive diagnostic tests and high-resolution imaging techniques facilitate the evaluation of any therapeutic intervention. In this review, we evaluate the progress to date of current cell therapy strategies for retinal repair, focusing on transplantation of pluripotent stem-cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and photoreceptor cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85089125459", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36702150800": {"Name": "West E.L.", "AuthorID": "36702150800", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Therapy, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56522353400": {"Name": "Ribeiro J.", "AuthorID": "56522353400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Therapy, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60022590, 60025778", "AffiliationName": "Kellogg Eye Center, University of Michigan"}}}
