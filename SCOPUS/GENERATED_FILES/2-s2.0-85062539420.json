Published by IOP Publishing Ltd on behalf of the Institute of Physics and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.Various company interactions can be described by networks, for instance the ownership networks and the board membership networks. To understand the ecosystem of companies, these interactions cannot be seen in isolation. For this purpose we construct a new multiplex network of interactions between companies in Germany and in the United Kingdom, combining ownership links, social ties through joint board directors, R&D collaborations and stock correlations in one linked multiplex dataset. We describe the features of this network and show there exists a non-trivial overlap between these different types of networks, where the different types of connections complement each other and make the overall structure more complex. This highlights that corporate control, boardroom influence and other connections have different structures and together make an even smaller corporate world than previously reported. We have a first look at the relation between company performance and location in the network structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["complex networks", "economics", "finance", "multilayer networks", "structure of markets"], "IndexKeywords": ["Company performance", "Corporate control", "Corporate networks", "Different structure", "Multi-layer network", "Multilayer structures", "Multiplex networks", "Network structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062539420", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57207468090": {"Name": "Jeude J.", "AuthorID": "57207468090", "AffiliationID": "60102060", "AffiliationName": "IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca"}, "55139905100": {"Name": "Caldarelli G.", "AuthorID": "55139905100", "AffiliationID": "60013494, 60083127", "AffiliationName": "European Centre for Living Technology, Universita di Venezia 'Ca' Foscari'"}, "7003460450": {"Name": "Aste T.", "AuthorID": "7003460450", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College London"}}}
