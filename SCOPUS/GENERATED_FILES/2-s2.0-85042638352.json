Despite this, relatively little work has been performed on the optimisation of their synthesis and subsequent reaction with immunoglobulins. Herein we present a novel synthetic route towards functionalised dibromopyridazinediones, proceeding via an isolatable dibromopyridazinedione-NHS ester. Reaction of this activated intermediate with a variety of amines produces functional dibromopyridazinediones in good to excellent yields. The disulfide rebridging capacity of these reagents was optimised on the clinically relevant IgG1 trastuzumab, resulting in a general method which allows for the generation of site-selectively modified native trastuzumab with over 90% homogeneity (no disulfide scrambling) without the need for protein engineering or enzymatic conjugation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antibody conjugation", "Bio-conjugation", "Disulfide bonds", "General method", "Optimisations", "Protein engineering", "Synthetic routes", "Trastuzumab", "Amines", "Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological", "Disulfides", "Humans", "Immunoconjugates", "Pyridazines", "Trastuzumab"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042638352", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57200940983": {"Name": "Bahou C.", "AuthorID": "57200940983", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57037847400": {"Name": "Richards D.", "AuthorID": "57037847400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55693565400": {"Name": "Maruani A.", "AuthorID": "55693565400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57195287990": {"Name": "Javaid F.", "AuthorID": "57195287990", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006818968": {"Name": "Caddick S.", "AuthorID": "7006818968", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57213031295": {"Name": "Baker J.", "AuthorID": "57213031295", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24536976100": {"Name": "Chudasama V.", "AuthorID": "24536976100", "AffiliationID": "60016187, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Medicines (IMed.ULisboa), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "57193857712": {"Name": "Love E.", "AuthorID": "57193857712", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "LifeArc Accelerator Building Open Innovation Campus"}}}
