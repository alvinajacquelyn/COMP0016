Quantifying the relative adverse and beneficial effects of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids should therefore be prioritized. Whereas newspaper headlines have focused on links between cannabis and psychosis, less attention has been paid to the much more common problem of cannabis addiction. Certain cognitive changes have also been attributed to cannabis use, although their causality and longevity are fiercely debated. Identifying why some individuals are more vulnerable than others to the adverse effects of cannabis is now of paramount importance to public health. Here, we review the current state of knowledge about such vulnerability factors, the variations in types of cannabis, and the relationship between these and cognition and addiction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Addictive", "Brain", "Cannabis", "Case-Control Studies", "Cognition", "Humans", "Marijuana Smoking", "Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962695119", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7005313659": {"Name": "Curran H.", "AuthorID": "7005313659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "35077456700": {"Name": "Freeman T.", "AuthorID": "35077456700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "55643477300": {"Name": "Mokrysz C.", "AuthorID": "55643477300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychopharmacology Unit, University College London"}, "57204536028": {"Name": "Morgan C.", "AuthorID": "57204536028", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Psychopharmacology and Addiction Research Centre, University of Exeter"}, "57058875800": {"Name": "Lewis D.", "AuthorID": "57058875800", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Pittsburgh"}, "7101771685": {"Name": "Parsons L.", "AuthorID": "7101771685", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Scripps Research Institute"}}}
