Whilst each domain has its own MANO, the MANOs are configured in a north-south way creating a hierarchy of service provision capabilities, rather than configured in the more common peer-to-peer approach. This approach works particularly well where each domain, from the mobile edge, to the core DC, can be managed independently of the others, but needs to be combined to form slices. End-to-end slices across the whole infrastructure provide a more effective resource management and also better support the customers' mobility requirements. The details of the architecture to support this scenario are described.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["End to end", "Multi domains", "On demands", "Peer-to-peer approach", "Resource management", "Service elements", "Service provisions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061530587", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"]], "AuthorData": {"35106246600": {"Name": "Tusa F.", "AuthorID": "35106246600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "35217494700": {"Name": "Clayman S.", "AuthorID": "35217494700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "55806720200": {"Name": "Valocchi D.", "AuthorID": "55806720200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "6603596791": {"Name": "Galis A.", "AuthorID": "6603596791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
