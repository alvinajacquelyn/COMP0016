However, effective water and temperature management calls for a different approach to conventional fuel cells. Improved understanding of the link between current density, temperature, water formation and hydration of the membrane is required to optimise cell design. This work uses thermal imaging, optical visualisation, gravimetric analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to study the links between these factors and also examines the effect of cell orientation on performance. The results reinforce the importance of cell temperature for water management, which is a function of current density. Regions of the cell with higher temperature avoid flooding by promoting vapour phase water; however, this can lead to higher membrane resistance due to dehydration. The results reveal that transition in the water balance regime from continuous hydration and flooding to drying with increasing current density occurs between 34 \u00b0C-40 \u00b0C (at 250 mA cm-2) and water generation is balanced with evaporation at \u223c50 \u00b0C (550 mA cm-2). Finally, fuel cell orientation affects performance after extended operation due to the effect of water accumulation and evaporation, with the cathode in a 'flat upwards' orientation found to be most resistant to flooding and cathode in a flat downwards orientation the most likely to flood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy", "Fuel cell gravimetric analysis", "Fuel cell orientation", "Open-cathode fuel cell", "Temperature mapping", "Water management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell orientation", "Extended operations", "Membrane resistance", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cells", "Temperature management", "Temperature mapping", "Thermal characterisation", "Water accumulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955344177", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55945556300": {"Name": "Obeisun O.", "AuthorID": "55945556300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202240331": {"Name": "Meyer Q.", "AuthorID": "57202240331", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56728647800": {"Name": "Engebretsen E.", "AuthorID": "56728647800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56613490600": {"Name": "Finegan D.", "AuthorID": "56613490600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55869997100": {"Name": "Robinson J.", "AuthorID": "55869997100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56140429400": {"Name": "Hinds G.", "AuthorID": "56140429400", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}}}
