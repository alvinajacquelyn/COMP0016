Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.The elevated rate of evolution for genes on sex chromosomes compared with autosomes (Fast-X or Fast-Z evolution) can result either from positive selection in the heterogametic sex or from nonadaptive consequences of reduced relative effective population size. Recent work in birds suggests that Fast-Z of coding sequence is primarily due to relaxed purifying selection resulting from reduced relative effective population size. However, gene sequence and gene expression are often subject to distinct evolutionary pressures; therefore, we tested for Fast-Z in gene expression using next-generation RNA-sequencing data from multiple avian species. Similar to studies of Fast-Z in coding sequence, we recover clear signatures of Fast-Z in gene expression; however, in contrast to coding sequence, our data indicate that Fast-Z in expression is due to positive selection acting primarily in females. In the soma, where gene expression is highly correlated between the sexes, we detected Fast-Z in both sexes, although at a higher rate in females, suggesting that many positively selected expression changes in females are also expressed in males. In the gonad, where intersexual correlations in expression are much lower, we detected Fast-Z for female gene expression, but crucially, not males. This suggests that a large amount of expression variation is sex-specific in its effects within the gonad. Taken together, our results indicate that Fast-Z evolution of gene expression is the product of positive selection acting on recessive beneficial alleles in the heterogametic sex. More broadly, our analysis suggests that the adaptive potential of Z chromosome gene expression may be much greater than that of gene sequence, results which have important implications for the role of sex chromosomes in speciation and sexual selection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drift", "Fast-X", "female heterogamety", "gene expression divergence", "selection", "sex chromosomes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Birds", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Male", "Selection, Genetic", "Species Specificity", "Spleen", "Statistics, Nonparametric"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943422600", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"16240675400": {"Name": "Dean R.", "AuthorID": "16240675400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "36916754200": {"Name": "Harrison P.", "AuthorID": "36916754200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "54883184700": {"Name": "Wright A.", "AuthorID": "54883184700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "37058254400": {"Name": "Zimmer F.", "AuthorID": "37058254400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6603493469": {"Name": "Mank J.", "AuthorID": "6603493469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
