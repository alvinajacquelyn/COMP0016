Electron-spin resonance, magnetometry and heat capacity measurements reveal the presence of staggered g tensors, a rich low-temperature excitation spectrum, a staggered susceptibility, and a spin gap that opens on the application of a magnetic field. These phenomena are reminiscent of those previously observed in nonchiral staggered chains, which are explicable within the sine-Gordon quantum-field theory. In the present case, however, although the sine-Gordon model accounts well for the form of the temperature dependence of the heat capacity, the size of the gap and its measured linear field dependence do not fit with the sine-Gordon theory as it stands. We propose that the differences arise due to additional terms in the Hamiltonian resulting from the chiral structure of [Cu(pym)(H2O)4]SiF6\u00b7H2O, particularly a uniform Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling and a fourfold periodic staggered field.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chiral structures", "Dzyaloshinskii-moriya", "Heat capacity measurements", "Low temperature excitation", "Quantum field theory", "Sine Gordon model", "Staggered susceptibility", "Temperature dependence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061255865", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36093108500": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "36093108500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55838510124": {"Name": "Johnson R.", "AuthorID": "55838510124", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "7003985246": {"Name": "Ardavan A.", "AuthorID": "7003985246", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "56522145600": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "56522145600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "7004826134": {"Name": "Blundell S.", "AuthorID": "7004826134", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "16022423000": {"Name": "Kittaka S.", "AuthorID": "16022423000", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo"}, "7202130719": {"Name": "Sakakibara T.", "AuthorID": "7202130719", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo"}, "13004637000": {"Name": "Kohama Y.", "AuthorID": "13004637000", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo"}, "8935569900": {"Name": "Lancaster T.", "AuthorID": "8935569900", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Materials Physics, Durham University"}, "8090929600": {"Name": "Singleton J.", "AuthorID": "8090929600", "AffiliationID": "60029965, 60006164", "AffiliationName": "National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory"}, "21638027900": {"Name": "Van Tol J.", "AuthorID": "21638027900", "AffiliationID": "60012284, 60002092", "AffiliationName": "National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Florida State University"}, "57193063455": {"Name": "Manson Z.", "AuthorID": "57193063455", "AffiliationID": "60011188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Eastern Washington University"}, "7402004912": {"Name": "Manson J.", "AuthorID": "7402004912", "AffiliationID": "60011188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Eastern Washington University"}, "7102842122": {"Name": "Goddard P.", "AuthorID": "7102842122", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}}}
