PPAR\u03b3 was initially identified through its role in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism and cell differentiation. It also influences the expression or activity of a number of genes in a variety of signalling networks. These include regulation of redox balance, fatty acid oxidation, immune responses and mitochondrial function. Recent studies suggest that the PPAR\u03b3 agonists may serve as good candidates for the treatment of several neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, even though multiple etiological factors contribute to the development of these disorders. Recent reports have also signposted a role for PPAR\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) in several neurodegenerative disorders including PD. In this review, we explore the current knowledge of mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of PPAR\u03b3 agonists and PGC-1\u03b1 in models of PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Neuroprotection", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "PGC-1 alpha", "PPAR gamma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Humans", "Parkinson Disease", "PPAR gamma", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939883815", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"8116623700": {"Name": "Corona J.", "AuthorID": "8116623700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7005847722": {"Name": "Duchen M.", "AuthorID": "7005847722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
