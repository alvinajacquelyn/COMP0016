Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are already translation equivariant: input image translations produce proportionate feature map translations. This is not the case for rotations. Global rotation equivariance is typically sought through data augmentation, but patch-wise equivariance is more difficult. We present Harmonic Networks or H-Nets, a CNN exhibiting equivariance to patch-wise translation and 360-rotation. We achieve this by replacing regular CNN filters with circular harmonics, returning a maximal response and orientation for every receptive field patch. H-Nets use a rich, parameter-efficient and fixed computational complexity representation, and we show that deep feature maps within the network encode complicated rotational invariants. We demonstrate that our layers are general enough to be used in conjunction with the latest architectures and techniques, such as deep supervision and batch normalization. We also achieve state-of-the-art classification on rotated-MNIST, and competitive results on other benchmark challenges.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Circular harmonics", "Convolutional neural network", "Data augmentation", "Global rotation", "Harmonic networks", "Receptive fields", "Rotational invariants", "State of the art"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044541940", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"57191706633": {"Name": "Worrall D.E.", "AuthorID": "57191706633", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57191486204": {"Name": "Garbin S.J.", "AuthorID": "57191486204", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56781497200": {"Name": "Turmukhambetov D.", "AuthorID": "56781497200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15135206900": {"Name": "Brostow G.J.", "AuthorID": "15135206900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
