The most basic model is called simple assembly line balancing problem type 1 (SALBP-1). We provide a survey on 12 heuristics and 9 lower bounds for this model and test them on a traditional and a lately-published benchmark dataset. The present paper focuses on algorithms published before 2011. We improve an already existing dynamic programming and a tabu search approach significantly. These two are also identified as the most effective heuristics; each with advantages for certain problem characteristics. Additionally we show that lower bounds for SALBP-1 can be distinctly sharpened when merging them and applying problem reduction techniques. \u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.
