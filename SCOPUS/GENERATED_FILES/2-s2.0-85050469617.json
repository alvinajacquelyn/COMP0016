This paper studies the downlink coverage performance of mmWave cellular networks with beam alignment errors. An enhanced antenna model is adopted to model the directional antenna beamforming pattern, in which the mainlobe beamwidth and directivity gains can be expressed as functions of the number of elements in the antenna array. After deriving the probability density function (PDF) of distance between mobile station (MS) and its serving base station (BS), the directivity gain with beam alignment errors is obtained as a discrete random variable. Then, a computationally tractable expression is derived for the coverage probability of mmWave cellular networks. Numerical results indicate that small beam alignment errors will not deteriorate the coverage probability significantly. Moreover, when the beam alignment error is small enough, the coverage performance can be improved by increasing the number of elements in the antenna array.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coverage analysis", "Coverage probabilities", "Directional Antenna", "Discrete random variables", "Millimeter waves (mmwave)", "Next generation mobile communications", "Numerical results", "Probability density function (pdf)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050469617", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"56438546000": {"Name": "Cheng M.", "AuthorID": "56438546000", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "56578841900": {"Name": "Wang J.B.", "AuthorID": "56578841900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "56206125100": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "56206125100", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "55767262500": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "55767262500", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Navigation and Location Based Services, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "7402179288": {"Name": "Xia X.G.", "AuthorID": "7402179288", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55724121000": {"Name": "Lin M.", "AuthorID": "55724121000", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "College of Telecommunications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}}}
