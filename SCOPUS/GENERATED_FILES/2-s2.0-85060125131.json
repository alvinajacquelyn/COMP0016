Zalabardo argues that safety fails to dominate sensitivity; specifically: some cases of knowledge failure can only be explained by sensitivity. In this paper, I resist Zalabardo\u2019s conclusion that domination failure confers differential support for sensitivity. Specifically, I argue that counterexamples to sensitivity undermine differential support for sensitivity. Using Zalabardo\u2019s modal framework, I consider a less demanding modal condition, what I call weak sensitivity, and I explain how weak sensitivity avoids an influential counterexample to sensitivity. However, I argue that we can subvert that counterexample only by abandoning Zalabardo\u2019s case for domination failure. So either way, we cannot differentially support sensitivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Differential support", "Epistemic luck", "Modal epistemology", "Safety", "Sensitivity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060125131", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"57205471099": {"Name": "Neil C.", "AuthorID": "57205471099", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}}}
