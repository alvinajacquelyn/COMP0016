Following suturing of the implant to the sclera, the device was flow tested. No flow was observed through the device tube and a significant ballooning of the tube diameter occurred with increased pressure on the device. The device was explanted from the eye and replaced with a different implant without further postoperative complication. The explanted device was assessed using custom microfluidic equipment in an in vitro environment.Results:This phenomenon occurred despite using several different batches of the 3-0 Supramid stent suture and the device had to be removed and replaced with another device without complication. In vitro microfluidic assessment of the device demonstrated no flow across the device tube despite over 150 mm Hg of pressure being exerted on the device.Conclusions:We hypothesize that the blockage occurred at the junction between the device tube and plate and that the ballooning phenomenon observed was due to a defect in the tube wall. This case highlights the importance of flow testing all glaucoma drainage devices before insertion given the variation in manufacturing conditions to avoid the risk of intraoperative complications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Baerveldt", "complication", "GDD", "glaucoma", "IOP", "surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Glaucoma Drainage Implants", "Glaucoma, Open-Angle", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Intraoperative Complications", "Nylons", "Prosthesis Failure", "Retrospective Studies", "Sutures", "Tonometry, Ocular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060740168", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56878015600": {"Name": "Lee R.M.H.", "AuthorID": "56878015600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "15724255800": {"Name": "Bouremel Y.", "AuthorID": "15724255800", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6701323615": {"Name": "Brocchini S.", "AuthorID": "6701323615", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7006126106": {"Name": "Eames I.", "AuthorID": "7006126106", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Mechanical Engineering"}}}
