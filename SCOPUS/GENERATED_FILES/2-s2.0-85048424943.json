{"Title": "Part 2: Is the maxillary canting and its surgical correction in patients with CFM correlated to the mandibular deformity?", "Year": 2018, "Source": "J. Cranio-Maxillofac. Surg.", "Volume": "46", "Issue": 9, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 1436, "PageEnd": 1440, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1016/j.jcms.2018.05.044", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048424943&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018Introduction: Patients with Craniofacial Microsomia (CFM) mandibles Types I/IIa benefit from combined LeFort 1 osteotomy and Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis (LeFort + MDO); Type IIb from LeFort + MDO or Bimaxillary osteotomy (BiMax); and Type III from BiMax (with 50% of cases having preceding mandibular procedures, including patient-fitted prosthesis); as seen in Part 1. This leads to the question how maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia are correlated and influence the types of maxillary correction. Material and methods: A retrospective chart study was conducted including patients diagnosed with CFM from 2 large craniofacial units. Radiographic and clinical information were obtained. Unilateral affected patients with available (ConeBeam) CT-scan of the maxillary-mandibular complex, without treatment of the upper jaw prior to the CT-scan were included. A maxillary cant grading system was set up and evaluated. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to correlate the maxillary cant and the severity of the mandibular hypoplasia. Results: Eighty-one patients were included, of whom 39.5% had a Pruzansky-Kaban type III mandible and 42% a mild maxillary cant. There was a significant positive correlation between severity of the mandibular hypoplasia and the categorized canting (r = 0.370; p < 0.001; n = 81). Twenty-four patients had maxillary surgery, mainly a BiMax. Conclusion: There is a positive correlation between the severity of mandibular hypoplasia and maxillary cant. The severity of mandibular hypoplasia seems to dictate an intervention for both maxillary and mandibular surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mandibular distraction osteogenesis", "Oculo-auriculo-vertebral syndrome", "OMENS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Cone-Beam Computed Tomography", "Esthetics, Dental", "Facial Asymmetry", "Female", "Goldenhar Syndrome", "Humans", "Male", "Mandibular Reconstruction", "Maxillofacial Development", "Osteogenesis, Distraction", "Osteotomy, Le Fort", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048424943", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"54793463300": {"Name": "Pluijmers B.I.", "AuthorID": "54793463300", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "The Dutch Craniofacial Centre, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center, Sophia's Children's Hospital"}, "57196370439": {"Name": "van de Lande L.S.", "AuthorID": "57196370439", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Oral Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "55951479500": {"Name": "Caron C.J.J.M.", "AuthorID": "55951479500", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "The Dutch Craniofacial Centre, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center, Sophia's Children's Hospital"}, "6602721170": {"Name": "Wolvius E.B.", "AuthorID": "6602721170", "AffiliationID": "60015627, 60032114", "AffiliationName": "The Dutch Craniofacial Centre, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center, Sophia's Children's Hospital"}, "6603112761": {"Name": "Koudstaal M.J.", "AuthorID": "6603112761", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7004067604": {"Name": "Padwa B.L.", "AuthorID": "7004067604", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Oral Surgery, Boston Children's Hospital"}, "7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.J.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
