Computational tools that predict the course and severity of these symptoms have the potential to assist oncology clinicians to personalize the patient\u2019s treatment regimen more efficiently and provide more aggressive and timely interventions. Three common and inter-related symptoms in cancer patients are depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. In this paper, we elaborate on the efficiency of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Non-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis by Neural Networks (n-CCA) to predict the severity of the aforementioned symptoms between two different time points during a cycle of chemotherapy (CTX). Our results demonstrate that these two methods produced equivalent results for all three symptoms. These types of predictive models can be used to identify high risk patients, educate patients about their symptom experience, and improve the timing of pre-emptive and personalized symptom management interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Neoplasms", "Neural Networks (Computer)", "Support Vector Machine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059291212", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57196396234": {"Name": "Papachristou N.", "AuthorID": "57196396234", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}, "56121040400": {"Name": "Puschmann D.", "AuthorID": "56121040400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}, "9337843600": {"Name": "Barnaghi P.", "AuthorID": "9337843600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}, "6601973141": {"Name": "Ream E.", "AuthorID": "6601973141", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing, University of Surrey"}, "57203199622": {"Name": "Cooper B.", "AuthorID": "57203199622", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "55603985300": {"Name": "Hu X.", "AuthorID": "55603985300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "23027830700": {"Name": "Kober K.", "AuthorID": "23027830700", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "35516352100": {"Name": "Levine J.", "AuthorID": "35516352100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "55741224100": {"Name": "Paul S.", "AuthorID": "55741224100", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "7005529575": {"Name": "Miaskowski C.", "AuthorID": "7005529575", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}, "15077262300": {"Name": "Maguire R.", "AuthorID": "15077262300", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "University of Strathclyde"}, "7006688048": {"Name": "McCann L.", "AuthorID": "7006688048", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "University of Strathclyde"}, "57194461192": {"Name": "Apostolidis K.", "AuthorID": "57194461192", "AffiliationID": "119500391", "AffiliationName": "European Cancer Patient Coalition"}, "6601973665": {"Name": "Conley Y.", "AuthorID": "6601973665", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, University of Pittsburgh"}, "16315356900": {"Name": "Hammer M.", "AuthorID": "16315356900", "AffiliationID": "60000764", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nursing, Mount Sinai Medical Center"}, "6602429085": {"Name": "Katsaragakis S.", "AuthorID": "6602429085", "AffiliationID": "60003684", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Nursing, University of Peloponnese"}, "6507101723": {"Name": "Patiraki E.", "AuthorID": "6507101723", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "National and Kapodistrian University of Athens"}, "20433757000": {"Name": "Furlong E.", "AuthorID": "20433757000", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems"}, "57194471451": {"Name": "Fox P.", "AuthorID": "57194471451", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "UCD School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems"}, "56188021100": {"Name": "Wright F.", "AuthorID": "56188021100", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Yale University"}}}
