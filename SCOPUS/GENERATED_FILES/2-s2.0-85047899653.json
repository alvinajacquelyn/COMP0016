Namely, distancing may not be a binary, continuously on/off process. Rather we suggest that changes in distancing as actualized via the relation between the individual and art (e.g., through empathy) might be a useful avenue for further consideration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Emotions", "Empathy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047899653", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"36150001500": {"Name": "Gerger G.", "AuthorID": "36150001500", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna"}, "24401605300": {"Name": "Ishizu T.", "AuthorID": "24401605300", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna"}, "16304982900": {"Name": "Pelowski M.", "AuthorID": "16304982900", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna"}}}
