We investigate whether event-related potentials (ERPs), too, are predicted by information measures. Three types of language models estimated four different information measures on each word of a sample of English sentences. Six different ERP deflections were extracted from the EEG signal of participants reading the same sentences. A comparison between the information measures and ERPs revealed a reliable correlation between N400 amplitude and word surprisal. Language models that make no use of syntactic structure fitted the data better than did a phrase-structure grammar, which did not account for unique variance in N400 amplitude. These findings suggest that different information measures quantify cognitively different processes and that readers do not make use of a sentence's hierarchical structure for generating expectations about the upcoming word.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Entropy", "Event-related potentials", "Information theory", "Reading", "Sentence comprehension", "Surprisal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Linguistics", "Male", "Probability", "Reading"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84910611051", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"7202570349": {"Name": "Frank S.", "AuthorID": "7202570349", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Language Studies, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "55919485500": {"Name": "Vigliocco G.", "AuthorID": "55919485500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "7005408598": {"Name": "Otten L.", "AuthorID": "7005408598", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56817076900": {"Name": "Galli G.", "AuthorID": "56817076900", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, University of Siena"}}}
