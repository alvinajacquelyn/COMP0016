Infinite dilution activity coefficient data for solutes dissolved in propanenitrile and butanenitrile have been compiled from the published chemical and engineering literature and converted into gas-to-liquid partition coefficients and water-to-organic solvent partition coefficients through standard thermodynamic relationships. Abraham model correlations were developed for describing solute transfer into both propanenitrile and butanenitrile by combining our measured solubility data with the partition coefficients that we calculated from the published activity coefficient data. The derived Abraham model correlations were found to back-calculate the observed partition coefficients and molar solubility data to within 0.14 log units.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abraham model correlations", "butanenitrile solvent", "partition coefficients", "propanenitrile solvent", "Solubility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abraham model", "Infinite dilution activity coefficients", "Molecular solute", "Organic solutes", "Partition coefficient", "Solubility data", "Solute transfer", "Thermodynamic relationships"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032810723", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57194724766": {"Name": "Klein A.", "AuthorID": "57194724766", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "55485915700": {"Name": "Barrera M.", "AuthorID": "55485915700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57195836604": {"Name": "Jodray M.", "AuthorID": "57195836604", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57196392275": {"Name": "Rodriguez K.", "AuthorID": "57196392275", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
