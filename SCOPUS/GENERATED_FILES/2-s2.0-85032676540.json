Protein drugs and live cells could be incorporated into the hydrogels during the in situ cross-linking, displaying sustained and pH/glucose-triggered drug release from the hydrogels and cell viability and proliferation in the three-dimensional hydrogel matrix as well. Hence, the hydrogels with insulin and fibroblasts were considered as bioactive dressings for diabetic wound healing. A streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model was used to evaluate the efficacy of hydrogel dressings in wound repair. The results revealed that the incorporation of insulin and L929 in the hydrogels could promote neovascularization and collagen deposition and enhance the wound-healing process of diabetic wounds. Thus, the drug- and cell-loaded hydrogels have promising potential in wound healing as a medicated system for various therapeutic proteins and live cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diabetic foot ulcers", "drug delivery system", "glucose responsive", "injectable hydrogel", "pH responsive", "wound dressing", "wound healing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diabetic foot ulcer", "Drug delivery system", "Glucose-responsive", "Injectable hydrogels", "PH-responsive", "Wound dressings", "Wound healing", "Animals", "Bandages", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Fibroblasts", "Glucose", "Hydrogels", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Insulin", "Rats", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032676540", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57203033250": {"Name": "Zhao L.", "AuthorID": "57203033250", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57196346604": {"Name": "Niu L.", "AuthorID": "57196346604", "AffiliationID": "60031419", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University"}, "7402854031": {"Name": "Liang H.", "AuthorID": "7402854031", "AffiliationID": "60031419", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Materials Science and Chemical Engineering, Ningbo University"}, "57193125677": {"Name": "Tan H.", "AuthorID": "57193125677", "AffiliationID": "60122036", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Neurosurgery, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital"}, "57188879979": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "57188879979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55262051200": {"Name": "Zhu F.", "AuthorID": "55262051200", "AffiliationID": "60122036", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Tissue Engineering, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital"}}}
