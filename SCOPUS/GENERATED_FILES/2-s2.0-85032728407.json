New approaches to CF gene therapy involving recent improvements to vector systems, both viral and non-viral, as well as new nucleic acid technologies have led to renewed interest in the field. The field of therapeutic gene editing is rapidly developing with the emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 as well as chemically modified mRNA therapeutics. These new types of nucleic acid therapies are also a good fit with delivery by non-viral delivery approaches which has led to a renewed interest in lipid-based and other nanoformulations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Dependovirus", "Gene Editing", "Genetic Therapy", "Genetic Vectors", "Humans", "Lentivirus", "Nucleic Acids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032728407", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57203103916": {"Name": "Hart S.L.", "AuthorID": "57203103916", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Personalised Medicines Section, Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7401612553": {"Name": "Harrison P.T.", "AuthorID": "7401612553", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, BioSciences Institute, University College Cork"}}}
