Here we report that some small prochiral molecules exhibit ee-dependent splitting of 1H NMR signals at room temperature based on acid/base interactions with chiral analytes, especially when either a chiral or prochiral acid contains a phenoxy group at the \u03b1-position of the carboxylic acid. As a representative case, the benzylamine (BA)/2-phenoxylpropionic acid (PPA) complex was comprehensively investigated by using various methods. Notably, X-ray crystallographic analysis shows that there are multipoint interactions in the BA/PPA complex, implying that \"fixing\" of molecular conformation is critical for efficient intermolecular transfer of magnetic anisotropy. Our results suggest that a wide range of prochiral molecules are available for NMR determination of ee when intermolecular interactions between prochiral molecules and chiral analytes are adequately designed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Intermolecular interactions", "Intermolecular transfer", "Molecular conformation", "Multi-point interaction", "NMR spectroscopic analysis", "Representative case", "Spectroscopic determinations", "X-ray crystallographic analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046413103", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"35069415900": {"Name": "Ishihara S.", "AuthorID": "35069415900", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}, "14045259500": {"Name": "Labuta J.", "AuthorID": "14045259500", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}, "7006586066": {"Name": "Ariga K.", "AuthorID": "7006586066", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Materials Science, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "55478833800": {"Name": "Hill J.", "AuthorID": "55478833800", "AffiliationID": "60002414", "AffiliationName": "World Premier International Center for Materials Nanoarchitectonics (WPI-MANA), National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS)"}, "32067636300": {"Name": "Futera Z.", "AuthorID": "32067636300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "36918953400": {"Name": "Mori S.", "AuthorID": "36918953400", "AffiliationID": "60002090", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Research Support Center, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Ehime University"}, "7410398350": {"Name": "Sato H.", "AuthorID": "7410398350", "AffiliationID": "60002090", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Ehime University"}}}
