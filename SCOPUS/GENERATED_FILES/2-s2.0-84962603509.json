The theorem was presented by Moessner in 1951 without a proof and later proved and generalized in several directions. More recently, a coinductive proof of the original theorem was given by Niqui and Rutten. We present a formalization of their proof in the Coq proof assistant. This formalization serves as a non-trivial illustration of the use of coinduction in Coq. During the formalization, we discovered that Long and Sali\u00e9\u2019s generalizations could also be proved using (almost) the same bisimulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bisimulations", "Coinduction", "Coq proof assistant", "Natural number", "Non-trivial"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962603509", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"37111004200": {"Name": "Krebbers R.", "AuthorID": "37111004200", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Aarhus University"}, "57188714703": {"Name": "Parlant L.", "AuthorID": "57188714703", "AffiliationID": "60005667", "AffiliationName": "\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon"}, "23398564400": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "23398564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
