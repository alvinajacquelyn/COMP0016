Elevated cardiac tissue cobalt levels are associated with myocardial injury while chromium is a well-established genotoxin. Though metal composition of tissues surrounding hip implants has been established, few investigators attempted to characterize the metal deposits in systemic tissues of total joint arthroplasty patients. Methods We report the first use of micro-X-ray fluorescence coupled with micro-X-ray absorption spectroscopy to probe distribution and chemical form of cobalt, chromium and titanium in postmortem samples of splenic, hepatic and cardiac tissue of patients with metal-on-polyethylene hip implants (n = 5). Results Majority of the cobalt was in the 2+ oxidation state, while titanium was present exclusively as titanium dioxide, in either rutile or anatase crystal structure. Chromium was found in a range of forms including a highly oxidised, carcinogenic species (CrV/VI), which has never been identified in human tissue before. Conclusions Carcinogenic forms of chromium might arise in vital organs of total joint arthroplasty patients. Further studies are warranted with patients with metal-on-metal implants, which tend to have an increased release of cobalt and chromium compared to metal-on-polyethylene hips.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alloys", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Chromium", "Cobalt", "Corrosion", "Female", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Laser Therapy", "Liver", "Male", "Mass Spectrometry", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Polyethylene", "Spleen", "Synchrotrons", "Tissue Distribution", "Titanium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039741550", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57200115000": {"Name": "Swiatkowska I.", "AuthorID": "57200115000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7003565868": {"Name": "Mosselmans J.F.W.", "AuthorID": "7003565868", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55255313700": {"Name": "Geraki T.", "AuthorID": "55255313700", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55618837400": {"Name": "Wyles C.C.", "AuthorID": "55618837400", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}, "6603951447": {"Name": "Maleszewski J.J.", "AuthorID": "6603951447", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}, "7004333127": {"Name": "Trousdale R.T.", "AuthorID": "7004333127", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7006243534": {"Name": "Sampson B.", "AuthorID": "7006243534", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Trace Element Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust"}, "57200116297": {"Name": "Osman I.", "AuthorID": "57200116297", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Trace Element Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College NHS Healthcare Trust"}, "57189304226": {"Name": "Potter D.B.", "AuthorID": "57189304226", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Departament of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
