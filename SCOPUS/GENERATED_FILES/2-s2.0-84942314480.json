Simulated Annealing (SA) and Greedy Algorithms have been widely used to find CIT test suites. From the literature, there is a widely-held belief that SA is slower, but produces more effective tests suites than Greedy and that SA cannot scale to higher strength coverage. We evaluated both algorithms on seven real-world subjects for the well-studied two-way up to the rarely-studied six-way interaction strengths. Our findings present evidence to challenge this current orthodoxy: real-world constraints allow SA to achieve higher strengths. Furthermore, there was no evidence that Greedy was less effective (in terms of time to fault revelation) compared to SA; the results for the greedy algorithm are actually slightly superior. However, the results are critically dependent on the approach adopted to constraint handling. Moreover, we have also evaluated a genetic algorithm for constrained CIT test suite generation. This is the first time strengths higher than 3 and constraint handling have been used to evaluate GA. Our results show that GA is competitive only for pairwise testing for subjects with a small number of constraints.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Combinatorial Interaction Testing", "Empirical Studies", "Prioritisation", "Software Testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combinatorial interaction testing", "Configuration space", "Constraint handling", "Empirical findings", "Empirical studies", "Interaction strength", "Prioritisation", "Real world constraints"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942314480", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"36615643200": {"Name": "Petke J.", "AuthorID": "36615643200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College London"}, "7006379048": {"Name": "Harman M.", "AuthorID": "7006379048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College London"}, "20435019400": {"Name": "Yoo S.", "AuthorID": "20435019400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science Department, University College London"}, "8719004300": {"Name": "Cohen M.", "AuthorID": "8719004300", "AffiliationID": "60026306", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science and Engineering Department, University of Nebraska-Lincoln"}}}
