Here, we compare the effects of \u03b12\u03b4-1 and an \u03b12\u03b4-like protein called Cachd1 on neuronal N-type (CaV2.2) channels, which are important in neurotransmission. Previous structural studies show the \u03b12\u03b4-1 VWA domain interacting with the first loop in CaV1.1 domain-I via its metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) motif and additional Cache domain interactions. Cachd1 has a disrupted MIDAS motif. However, Cachd1 increases CaV2.2 currents substantially (although less than \u03b12\u03b4-1) and increases CaV2.2 cell surface expression by reducing endocytosis. Although the effects of \u03b12\u03b4-1 are abolished by mutation of Asp122 in CaV2.2 domain-I, which mediates interaction with its VWA domain, the Cachd1 responses are unaffected. Furthermore, Cachd1 co-immunoprecipitates with CaV2.2 and inhibits co-immunoprecipitation of \u03b12\u03b4-1 by CaV2.2. Cachd1 also competes with \u03b12\u03b4-1 for effects on trafficking. Thus, Cachd1 influences both CaV2.2 trafficking and function and can inhibit responses to \u03b12\u03b4-1. Dahimene et al. examine the role of Cachd1, a protein with similarity to the auxiliary \u03b12\u03b4 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels. They find that Cachd1 increases N-type calcium currents substantially despite having a disrupted VWA interaction domain. Cachd1 also enhances channel trafficking and inhibits responses to \u03b12\u03b4-1.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cachd1", "cache domain", "cell surface expression", "interaction site", "voltage-gated calcium channel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Cell Membrane", "Hippocampus", "Ion Channel Gating", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mutation", "Neurites", "Protein Binding", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055913273", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"8225538400": {"Name": "Dahimene S.", "AuthorID": "8225538400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "35952724400": {"Name": "Page K.", "AuthorID": "35952724400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "13614243400": {"Name": "Kadurin I.", "AuthorID": "13614243400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "8506464000": {"Name": "Ferron L.", "AuthorID": "8506464000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57204519639": {"Name": "Ho D.", "AuthorID": "57204519639", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7201577660": {"Name": "Pratt W.", "AuthorID": "7201577660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "24498942300": {"Name": "Dolphin A.", "AuthorID": "24498942300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "19337605600": {"Name": "Powell G.", "AuthorID": "19337605600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "55228586400": {"Name": "Wilson S.", "AuthorID": "55228586400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
