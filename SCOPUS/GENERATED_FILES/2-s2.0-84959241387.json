We conducted meta-ethnography to synthesise 34 studies, using theories of stigma to further develop the synthesis. Studies suggested that the classroom context requiring pupils to sit still, be quiet and concentrate could trigger symptoms of ADHD, and that symptoms could then be exacerbated through informal/formal labelling and stigma, damaged self-perceptions and resulting poor relationships with staff and pupils. Influences of the school context on symptoms of ADHD were often invisible to teachers and pupils, with most attributions made to the individual pupil and/or the pupil\u2019s family. We theorise that this \u2018invisibility\u2019 is at least partly an artefact of stigma, and that the potential for stigma for ADHD to seem \u2018natural and right\u2019 in the context of schools needs to be taken into account when planning any intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADHD", "attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", "attributions", "meta-ethnography", "qualitative research", "school stigma"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959241387", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35487202400": {"Name": "Gwernan-Jones R.", "AuthorID": "35487202400", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "56708017300": {"Name": "Russell A.", "AuthorID": "56708017300", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "7202760757": {"Name": "Ford T.", "AuthorID": "7202760757", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "7003819360": {"Name": "Garside R.", "AuthorID": "7003819360", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "56493758000": {"Name": "Moore D.", "AuthorID": "56493758000", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC), University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "55250541500": {"Name": "Rogers M.", "AuthorID": "55250541500", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC), University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "35565208700": {"Name": "Thompson-Coon J.", "AuthorID": "35565208700", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC), University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "56367026700": {"Name": "Stein K.", "AuthorID": "56367026700", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "NIHR CLAHRC South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC), University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "55414812700": {"Name": "Cooper P.", "AuthorID": "55414812700", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Brunel University"}, "36053555200": {"Name": "Richardson M.", "AuthorID": "36053555200", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
