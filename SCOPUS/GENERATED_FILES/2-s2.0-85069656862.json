Lipotransfer is a method of reconstruction that can be used in the treatment of oro-facial fibrosis. The effect of this treatment not only restores oro-facial volume but has also been found to reverse the effects of orofacial fibrosis. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) within the engrafted adipose tissue have been shown to be anti-fibrotic in SSc and are proposed as the mechanism of the anti-fibrotic effect of lipotransfer. A cohort of 62 SSc patients with oro-facial fibrosis were assessed before and after stem cell enriched lipotransfer treatment. Clinical evaluation included assessment of mouth function using a validated assessment tool (Mouth Handicap in Systemic Sclerosis Scale-MHISS), validated psychological measurements and pre and postoperative volumetric assessment. In addition, to understand the mechanism by which the anti-fibrotic effect of ADSCs occur, SSc derived fibroblasts and ADSCs from this cohort of patients were co-cultured in direct and indirect culture systems and compared to monoculture controls. Cell viability, DNA content, protein secretion of known fibrotic mediators including growth factor- \u03b21 (TGF \u03b2-1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) using ELISA analysis and fibrosis gene expression using a fibrosis pathway specific qPCR array were evaluated. Mouth function (MHISS) was significantly improved (6.85\u00b15.07) (p<0.0001) after treatment. All psychological measures were significantly improved: DAS 24 (12.1\u00b19.5) (p<0.0001); HADS-anxiety (2.8\u00b13.2) (p<0.0001), HADS-depression (2.0\u00b13.1) (p<0.0001); BFNE (2.9 \u00b1 4.3) (p<0.0001); VAS (3.56\u00b14.1) (p<0.0001). Multiple treatments further improved mouth function (p<0.05), DAS (p<0.0001) and VAS (p = 0.01) scores. SSc fibroblast viability and proliferation was significantly reduced in co-culture compared to monoculture via a paracrine effect over 14 days (p < 0.0001). Protein secretion of transforming growth factor (TGF-\u03b21) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was significantly reduced in co-culture compared to monoculture (p < 0.0001). Multiple fibrosis associated genes were down regulated in SSc co-culture compared to monoculture after 14 days including Matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMMP-8), Platelet derived growth factor-\u03b2 (PDGF-\u03b2) funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adipose Tissue", "Aged", "Cells, Cultured", "Connective Tissue Growth Factor", "Female", "Fibroblasts", "Fibrosis", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Integrin beta Chains", "Male", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 8", "Middle Aged", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis", "Recovery of Function", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Stem Cells", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069656862", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56117624300": {"Name": "Almadori A.", "AuthorID": "56117624300", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Charles Wolfson Center for Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "36833858100": {"Name": "Griffin M.", "AuthorID": "36833858100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Charles Wolfson Center for Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "56900489600": {"Name": "Ryan C.M.", "AuthorID": "56900489600", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "57210150213": {"Name": "Hunt D.F.", "AuthorID": "57210150213", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "57210148899": {"Name": "Kumar R.", "AuthorID": "57210148899", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Charles Wolfson Center for Reconstructive Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "35549898400": {"Name": "Butler P.E.M.", "AuthorID": "35549898400", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60182839", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "24390768600": {"Name": "Hansen E.", "AuthorID": "24390768600", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "57203195982": {"Name": "Abraham D.J.", "AuthorID": "57203195982", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60182839", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60182839", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, UCL Division of Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}}}
