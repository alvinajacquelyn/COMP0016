{"Title": "Study protocol: DEcisions in health Care to Introduce or Diffuse innovations using Evidence (DECIDE)", "Year": 2016, "Source": "Implement.

However, cultural and organisational factors often prevent the translation of such evidence into practice. Using a multi-level framework, this project will analyse how interactions between the evidence available and processes at the micro (individual/group) and meso (organisational/system) levels influence decisions to introduce or diffuse innovations in acute and primary care within the National Health Service in the UK. Methods/design: This study will use a mixed methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, and involves four interdependent work streams: (1) rapid evidence synthesis of relevant literature with stakeholder feedback; (2) in-depth case studies of 'real-world' decision-making in acute and primary care; (3) a national survey and discrete choice experiment; and (4) development of guidance for decision-makers and evaluators to support the use of evidence in decision-making. Discussion: This study will enhance the understanding of decision-makers' use of diverse forms of evidence. The findings will provide insights into how and why some evidence does inform decisions to introduce healthcare innovations, and why barriers persist in other cases. It will also quantify decision-makers' preferences, including the 'tipping point' of evidence needed to shift stakeholders' views. Practical guidance will be shared with healthcare decision-makers and evaluators on uses of evidence to enable the introduction and diffusion of innovation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Decision-making", "Discrete choice experiment", "Ethnography", "Evidence", "Innovation", "Ophthalmology", "Qualitative", "Service improvement", "troke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making", "Diffusion of Innovation", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Interdisciplinary Communication", "Neoplasms", "State Medicine", "Stroke", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Translational Medical Research", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007489645", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"23478504000": {"Name": "Turner S.", "AuthorID": "23478504000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "6505965176": {"Name": "Sheringham J.", "AuthorID": "6505965176", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "57192690324": {"Name": "Hudson E.", "AuthorID": "57192690324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "7003777671": {"Name": "Fulop N.", "AuthorID": "7003777671", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}}}
