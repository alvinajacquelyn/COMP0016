Methods: Two hundred and fifty-four SSc patients from six Rheumatology Centres were included. Sera were collected and stored according to EUSTAR biobanking recommendations and analysed through automated high throughput diagnostics. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software. Results: Two hundred and forty-seven SSc patients (mean age 55.7 \u00b1 13.9 years, 202 F) were analysed. ELF score, TIMP-1 and PIIINP levels were higher in males (P = 0.0197, P = 0.0107, P = 0.0108 respectively) and in dcSSc (P = 0.001, P = 0.0008, P < 0.0001 respectively). ELF score and the single markers significantly correlated with modified Rodnan skin score (r = 0.37, P < 0.0001), disease activity and severity (P < 0.0001 for all markers, except for HA P = 0.0001) and inversely with forced vital capacity, (FVC) % (TIMP-1, r = -0.21, P = 0.0012; PIIINP, r = -0.26, P = 0.0001), TLC% (ELF score, r = -0.20, P = 0.0036; TIMP-1, r = -0.32, P < 0.0001; PIIINP, r = -0.28, P < 0.0001), diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) % (P < 0.0001 for all markers, except for HA P = 0.0115). Multivariate analysis indicated that age (P < 0.001), modified Rodnan skin score (P < 0.001) and DLCO% (P = 0.005) were independently associated with ELF score. Conclusion: Between the first and this validation studies, the value of the ELF score as independent marker of skin and lung involvement in SSc is confirmed in 457 patients. A longitudinal study is on-going to identify an SSc specific algorithm with predictive value for skin and lung progression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biological Specimen Banks", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Hyaluronic Acid", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Procollagen", "Pulmonary Fibrosis", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Severity of Illness Index", "Skin", "Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060592861", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"26031269600": {"Name": "Abignano G.", "AuthorID": "26031269600", "AffiliationID": "60086662", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Department of Lucania, San Carlo Hospital of Potenza and Madonna delle Grazie Hospital of Matera"}, "55919075900": {"Name": "Blagojevic J.", "AuthorID": "55919075900", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, University of Florence"}, "56123949200": {"Name": "Bissell L.A.", "AuthorID": "56123949200", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57188631952": {"Name": "Dumitru R.B.", "AuthorID": "57188631952", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57215276730": {"Name": "Eng S.", "AuthorID": "57215276730", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55863215700": {"Name": "Hutchinson M.", "AuthorID": "55863215700", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds"}, "7003995450": {"Name": "Buch M.H.", "AuthorID": "7003995450", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7201777137": {"Name": "Emery P.", "AuthorID": "7201777137", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57202944561": {"Name": "Del Galdo F.", "AuthorID": "57202944561", "AffiliationID": "60012508, 60170333", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7005642558": {"Name": "Matucci-Cerinic M.", "AuthorID": "7005642558", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, University of Florence"}, "7003519327": {"Name": "Allanore Y.", "AuthorID": "7003519327", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University of Paris Descartes"}, "23995253600": {"Name": "Avouac J.", "AuthorID": "23995253600", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University of Paris Descartes"}, "12777276300": {"Name": "Bosello S.", "AuthorID": "12777276300", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli"}, "35432450100": {"Name": "Ferraccioli G.", "AuthorID": "35432450100", "AffiliationID": "60073799", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London"}, "8398311200": {"Name": "Ong V.", "AuthorID": "8398311200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London"}, "7003679934": {"Name": "Distler O.", "AuthorID": "7003679934", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Zurich"}, "55853648800": {"Name": "Jordan S.", "AuthorID": "55853648800", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University Hospital Zurich"}, "36770624500": {"Name": "Messenger M.", "AuthorID": "36770624500", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Diagnostic Evidence Co-operative, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
