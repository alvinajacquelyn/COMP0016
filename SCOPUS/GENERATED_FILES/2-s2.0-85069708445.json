Design: Retrospective interventional case series. Methods: Medical records of all 28 SYCAMORE participants recruited at the Bristol Eye Hospital were reviewed at approximately 3-monthly intervals up to 5 years from the trial randomization date. Uveitis activity, treatment course, visual outcomes, ocular complications, and adverse events were recorded. Data are presented using summary statistics. Results: Following withdrawal of the investigational medicinal product (IMP), 25 of the 28 participants were started on adalimumab for active JIA-U. Of the 12 participants in the active treatment arm of the SYCAMORE study, 11 (92%) were restarted on adalimumab after withdrawal of the IMP for active JIA-U (median time to flare 188 days [range 42-413 days). Two participants stopped adalimumab for uncontrolled JIA-U. One participant had a reduction in vision to 0.3 owing to cataract. Mean visual acuity for the remaining 27 participants was -0.04 (right eye) and -0.05 (left eye). Conclusions: Drug-induced remission of JIA-U did not persist when adalimumab was withdrawn after 1-2 years of treatment. Adalimumab was well tolerated and visual acuity outcomes were excellent.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adalimumab", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Arthritis, Juvenile", "Child", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Uveitis", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069708445", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57203806804": {"Name": "Horton S.", "AuthorID": "57203806804", "AffiliationID": "60016719, 60170515", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Eye Hospital, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26666076700": {"Name": "Guly C.M.", "AuthorID": "26666076700", "AffiliationID": "60016719, 60170515", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Eye Hospital, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55712827400": {"Name": "Lee R.W.", "AuthorID": "55712827400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "7103296976": {"Name": "Dick A.D.", "AuthorID": "7103296976", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research and Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "26660306600": {"Name": "Jones A.P.", "AuthorID": "26660306600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Research Centre, Department of Biostatistics, University of Liverpool"}, "55999128200": {"Name": "Hardwick B.", "AuthorID": "55999128200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Trials Research Centre, Department of Biostatistics, University of Liverpool"}, "6603662700": {"Name": "Beresford M.W.", "AuthorID": "6603662700", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003605847": {"Name": "Ramanan A.V.", "AuthorID": "7003605847", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
