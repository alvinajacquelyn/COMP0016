However, these projects can only succeed if they are constantly assessed; namely, the projects infrastructure deployment must be closely monitored and evaluated. In this paper, we introduce a system called SIMMC, which is currently monitoring and evaluating more than 4,500 computing devices from Brazilian digital inclusion projects. This system is innovative because, in addition to being used by the government for managing and expanding its projects, the collected data is also publicly available on a web page, allowing the citizens to follow the projects' deployment. We describe the SIMMC architecture, reporting some techniques used to optimize its data analysis processes, and describe how the information acquired and presented by the system has been used to enable public administration overhaul and improve efficiency on the project management, as well as its strategic use for security, theft, and defrauding.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis process", "Computing devices", "Developing regions", "Digital inclusion", "Government IS", "Infrastructure deployments", "Internet connection", "ITS data"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046099210", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"37100670400": {"Name": "Trois C.", "AuthorID": "37100670400", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "15737469200": {"Name": "Weingaertner D.", "AuthorID": "15737469200", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "56595236100": {"Name": "Pasqualin D.", "AuthorID": "56595236100", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "57214015416": {"Name": "Maciel E.", "AuthorID": "57214015416", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "55253991900": {"Name": "Almeida E.", "AuthorID": "55253991900", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "23391072500": {"Name": "Silva F.", "AuthorID": "23391072500", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "56028204700": {"Name": "Tissot H.", "AuthorID": "56028204700", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "24821259100": {"Name": "Bona L.", "AuthorID": "24821259100", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "6701923033": {"Name": "Castilho M.", "AuthorID": "6701923033", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "57201777422": {"Name": "Didonet M.", "AuthorID": "57201777422", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}, "6506918536": {"Name": "Sunye M.", "AuthorID": "6506918536", "AffiliationID": "60015043", "AffiliationName": "Center for Scientific Computing and Free Software, Department of Informatics, Federal University of Paran\u00e1 (UFPR)"}}}
