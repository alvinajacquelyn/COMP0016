Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Sorting endosomes (SEs) are the regulatory hubs for sorting cargo to multiple organelles, including lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes in melanocytes. In parallel, melanosome biogenesis is initiated from SEs with the processing and sequential transport of melanocyte-specific proteins toward maturing melanosomes. However, the mechanism of cargo segregation on SEs is largely unknown. Here, RNAi screening in melanocytes revealed that knockdown of Rab4A results in defective melanosome maturation. Rab4A-depletion increases the number of vacuolar endosomes and disturbs the cargo sorting, which in turn lead to the mislocalization of melanosomal proteins to lysosomes, cell surface and exosomes. Rab4A localizes to the SEs and forms an endosomal complex with the adaptor AP-3, the effector rabenosyn-5 and the motor KIF3, which possibly coordinates cargo segregation on SEs. Consistent with this, inactivation of rabenosyn-5, KIF3A or KIF3B phenocopied the defects observed in Rab4A-knockdown melanocytes. Further, rabenosyn-5 was found to associate with rabaptin-5 or Rabip4/4\u2032 (isoforms encoded by Rufy1) and differentially regulate cargo sorting from SEs. Thus, Rab4A acts a key regulator of cargo segregation on SEs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AP-3", "KIF3", "Melanosome biogenesis", "Rab4A", "Rabaptin-5", "Rabenosyn-5", "Rabip4\u2032", "Sorting endosome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Endosomes", "Humans", "Lysosomes", "rab4 GTP-Binding Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053707611", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57203936232": {"Name": "Nag S.", "AuthorID": "57203936232", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science"}, "56940075900": {"Name": "Rani S.", "AuthorID": "56940075900", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science"}, "57004568200": {"Name": "Mahanty S.", "AuthorID": "57004568200", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science"}, "57203941844": {"Name": "Arora P.", "AuthorID": "57203941844", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science"}, "8619095100": {"Name": "Setty S.", "AuthorID": "8619095100", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science"}, "25937180900": {"Name": "Bissig C.", "AuthorID": "25937180900", "AffiliationID": "60105741, 60030640, 60008134, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS, UMR 144, Structure and Membrane Compartments"}, "24168354500": {"Name": "Delevoye C.", "AuthorID": "24168354500", "AffiliationID": "60105741, 60030640, 60008134, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS, UMR144, Cell and Tissue Imaging Facility (PICT-IBiSA)"}, "6507039228": {"Name": "Van Niel G.", "AuthorID": "6507039228", "AffiliationID": "60105741, 60030640, 60008134, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS, UMR144, Cell and Tissue Imaging Facility (PICT-IBiSA)"}, "7003343185": {"Name": "Raposo G.", "AuthorID": "7003343185", "AffiliationID": "60105741, 60030640, 60008134, 60108665", "AffiliationName": "Institut Curie, PSL Research University, CNRS, UMR144, Cell and Tissue Imaging Facility (PICT-IBiSA)"}, "12786687200": {"Name": "Azevedo C.", "AuthorID": "12786687200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6701885812": {"Name": "Saiardi A.", "AuthorID": "6701885812", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7003849364": {"Name": "Van Der Sluijs P.", "AuthorID": "7003849364", "AffiliationID": "60010954, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Cellular Protein Chemistry, Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research, Utrecht University"}}}
