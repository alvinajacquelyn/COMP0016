Behavioural and neurological changes in elderly subjects suggest that the spatial representations of the environment might decline compared to young participants. However, no data are available on the use of different reference frames within topographical space in aging. Here we investigated the use of allocentric and egocentric frames in aging, by asking young and older participants to encode the location of a target in a virtual room relative either to stable features of the room (allocentric environment-based frame), or to an unstable objects set (allocentric objects-based frame), or to the viewer\u2019s viewpoint (egocentric frame). After a viewpoint change of 0\u00b0 (absent), 45\u00b0 (small) or 135\u00b0 (large), participants judged whether the target was in the same spatial position as before relative to one of the three frames. Results revealed a different susceptibility to viewpoint changes in older than young participants. Importantly, we detected a worst performance, in terms of reaction times, for older than young participants in the allocentric frames. The deficit was more marked for the environment-based frame, for which a lower sensitivity was revealed as well as a worst performance even when no viewpoint change occurred. Our data provide new evidence of a greater vulnerability of the allocentric, in particular environment-based, spatial coding with aging, in line with the retrogenesis theory according to which cognitive changes in aging reverse the sequence of acquisition in mental development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Spatial Memory", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930864737", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"55735884100": {"Name": "Montefinese M.", "AuthorID": "55735884100", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Advanced Biomedical Technologies - ITAB, Foundation G. d\u2019Annunzio"}, "8314075000": {"Name": "Committeri G.", "AuthorID": "8314075000", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Advanced Biomedical Technologies - ITAB, Foundation G. d\u2019Annunzio"}, "53986787200": {"Name": "Sulpizio V.", "AuthorID": "53986787200", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuropsychology, Fondazione Santa Lucia IRCCS"}, "57195031340": {"Name": "Galati G.", "AuthorID": "57195031340", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Brain Imaging Laboratory, Department of Psychology, Sapienza University"}}}
