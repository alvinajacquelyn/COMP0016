More recently, overexpression of Axl has emerged as a key molecular determinant underlying the development of acquired resistance to targeted anticancer agents. The activation of Axl is overexpression-dependent and controls a number of hallmarks of cancer progression including proliferation, migration, resistance to apoptosis and survival through a complex network of intracellular second messengers. Axl has been noted to influence clinically meaningful end points including metastatic recurrence and survival in the vast majority of tumour types. With Axl inhibitors having gained momentum as novel anticancer therapies, we provide an overview of the biological and clinical relevance of this molecular pathway, outlining the main directions of research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins", "Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960923043", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"57169174500": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "57169174500", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}, "57169443100": {"Name": "Black J.R.M.", "AuthorID": "57169443100", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}, "56434950800": {"Name": "Sharma R.", "AuthorID": "56434950800", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}, "56343983100": {"Name": "Stebbing J.", "AuthorID": "56343983100", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}, "35180464500": {"Name": "Pinato D.J.", "AuthorID": "35180464500", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus"}}}
