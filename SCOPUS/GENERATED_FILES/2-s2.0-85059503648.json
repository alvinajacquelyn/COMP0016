METHODS: DMEK was performed in 2 patients with aphakic bullous keratopathy. The indications for keratoplasty were endothelial failure caused by chronic intermediate uveitis and glaucoma in 1 case and decompensated previous penetrating keratoplasty in the other. Both cases had enlarged pupils and had previously undergone pars plana vitrectomy. In both cases, the DMEK graft dislocated into the vitreous cavity during unfolding maneuvers and could not be retrieved during the same procedure. RESULTS: No signs of retinal detachment were observed during follow-up (6 months and 1 year). Although visualization of the graft was not possible on examination, B-scan confirmed the presence of the lenticule lying over the retina. One case underwent repeat DMEK, and 1 case underwent repeat penetrating keratoplasty. In 1 case, the graft was retrieved after a month and sent for histopathology. In both cases, corneal transparency and corrected visual acuity improved to full potential after the final procedure. Histopathology of the retrieved graft showed only endothelial cell loss and no fibrocellular proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of fibrous proliferation and retinal detachment after posterior dislocation of DMEK grafts may be less than in grafts including corneal stroma, but pars plana vitrectomy and retrieval of the dislocated corneal transplant are still indicated after revision corneal transplant surgery where visual symptoms or signs of fibrotic change around the dislocated graft are evident.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Corneal Diseases", "Descemet Membrane", "Descemet Stripping Endothelial Keratoplasty", "Endothelium, Corneal", "Female", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Vitreous Body", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059503648", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57191439856": {"Name": "Vasquez-Perez A.", "AuthorID": "57191439856", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and External Diseases Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56478557400": {"Name": "Brennan N.", "AuthorID": "56478557400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and External Diseases Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "24176560900": {"Name": "Ayoub T.", "AuthorID": "24176560900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and External Diseases Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7102506160": {"Name": "Allan B.", "AuthorID": "7102506160", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and External Diseases Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005642367": {"Name": "Larkin D.F.P.", "AuthorID": "7005642367", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and External Diseases Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6701376895": {"Name": "da Cruz L.", "AuthorID": "6701376895", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
