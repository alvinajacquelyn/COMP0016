KGaA, Weinheim.Experimental support for the dominance of van der Waals dispersion forces in aromatic stacking interactions occurring in organic solution is surprisingly limited. The size-dependence of aromatic stacking in an organic solvent was examined. The interaction energy was found to vary by about 7.5 kJ mol-1 on going from a phenyl-phenyl to an anthracene-pyrene stack. Strikingly, the experimental data were highly correlated with dispersion energies determined using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT), while the induction, exchange, electrostatic, and solvation energy components correlated poorly. Both the experimental data and the SAPT-dispersion energies gave high-quality correlations with the change in solvent accessible area upon complexation. Thus, the size-dependence of aromatic stacking interactions is consistent with the dominance of van der Waals dispersion forces even in the presence of a competing polarizable solvent. Size matters: Dispersion forces are found to govern the stacking interactions of aromatic rings even in the presence of a competitive polarizable organic solvent.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aromatic interactions", "molecular recognition", "supramolecular chemistry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aromatic interactions", "Aromatic stacking interactions", "Dispersion energies", "Interaction energies", "Organic solutions", "Polarizable solvents", "Stacking interaction", "Symmetry adapted perturbation theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954284874", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"55961095400": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "55961095400", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, Joseph Black Building"}, "57055145400": {"Name": "Brazier J.B.", "AuthorID": "57055145400", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, Joseph Black Building"}, "56126925500": {"Name": "Hubbard T.A.", "AuthorID": "56126925500", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, Joseph Black Building"}, "57214370903": {"Name": "Rogers D.M.", "AuthorID": "57214370903", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, Joseph Black Building"}, "6601989998": {"Name": "Cockroft S.L.", "AuthorID": "6601989998", "AffiliationID": "60027272, 60181355", "AffiliationName": "EaStCHEM School of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, Joseph Black Building"}}}
