Electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library) were searched up to 2nd July 2012 for published literature comparing hostility levels in women with different levels of PRL. Keyword pairs (prolactin and aggression, prolactin and hostil\u2217, prolactin and anger, and prolactin and angry) were entered simultaneously. From 1065 resulting titles, and one unpublished study, 214 articles underwent full-text review by authors JB and EM. Studies were selected based on clinical relevance. Eight comparative studies consisting of 242 female patients with high PRL levels, 207 female patients with normal PRL levels and 127 healthy controls with normal PRL levels were included. Data were analysed using the inverse variance method with a random-effects model. Analysis revealed significantly higher hostility in patients with high PRL compared with that in healthy control women (Z = 1.94, p < 0.05; Hedges g = 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]:-0.01-1.45), significantly higher hostility in patient controls compared with that in healthy controls (Z = 1.94, p < 0.05; Hedges g = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.00-0.94) and non-significantly higher hostility levels in patients with high PRL compared with that in patients with normal PRL levels (Z = 1.45, p < 0.15; Hedges g = 0.38; 95% CI:-0.13-0.89). In this meta-analysis, hostility appears to be accounted for partly by PRL levels and also partly by patient status, perhaps due to the stress of being a patient. Methodological considerations and implications for patient care are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hostility", "meta-analysis", "patient care", "prolactin", "review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Hostility", "Humans", "Inpatients", "Prolactin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944678242", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"24368170900": {"Name": "Barry J.A.", "AuthorID": "24368170900", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London Medical School"}, "7004362582": {"Name": "Hardiman P.J.", "AuthorID": "7004362582", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London Medical School"}, "57197027939": {"Name": "Moran E.", "AuthorID": "57197027939", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine"}, "57220878273": {"Name": "Thomas M.", "AuthorID": "57220878273", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Royal Free London Hospital"}}}
