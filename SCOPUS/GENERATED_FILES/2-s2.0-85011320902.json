However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic \u2018closed\u2019 conformation, and resulting increase in the A\u03b242/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011320902", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36500888200": {"Name": "Maesako M.", "AuthorID": "36500888200", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57193166099": {"Name": "Horlacher J.", "AuthorID": "57193166099", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Ulm"}, "57191163770": {"Name": "Zoltowska K.", "AuthorID": "57191163770", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "36241698600": {"Name": "Kastanenka K.", "AuthorID": "36241698600", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "55212159900": {"Name": "Kara E.", "AuthorID": "55212159900", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57192690439": {"Name": "Svirsky S.", "AuthorID": "57192690439", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57193167576": {"Name": "Keller L.", "AuthorID": "57193167576", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "35320158100": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "35320158100", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "35351120600": {"Name": "Hyman B.", "AuthorID": "35351120600", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7003973512": {"Name": "Bacskai B.", "AuthorID": "7003973512", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "6701387296": {"Name": "Berezovska O.", "AuthorID": "6701387296", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Laboratory, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
