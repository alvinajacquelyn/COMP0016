It is postulated as a way of restoring helpful missing microbes and preventing long term non-communicable diseases of babies delivered by caesarean section. Currently, there is a deluge of evidence being published on the human microbiome, which can be challenging to digest and absorb by scientists, clinicians and patients. The specific evidence base around this technique is at its early stages. This commentary discusses what advice is currently available from a feminist and a person-centred care perspective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caesarean section", "Ecology", "Feminism", "Microbiome seeding", "Non-communicable diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cesarean Section", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Microbiota", "Patient-Centered Care", "Pregnancy", "Vagina"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068370888", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57215370007": {"Name": "Lokugamage A.U.", "AuthorID": "57215370007", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}, "57193167092": {"Name": "Pathberiya S.D.C.", "AuthorID": "57193167092", "AffiliationID": "122799415", "AffiliationName": "Acculegal Solicitors"}}}
