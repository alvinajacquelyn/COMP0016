Design: Multicenter, cross-sectional, case-control study. Participants: We sequentially enrolled 499 patients with glaucoma and 444 normal subjects to analyze relative precision. A separate group of 44 patients with glaucoma and 54 normal subjects was analyzed to assess test\u2013retest variability. Methods: One eye of recruited subjects was tested with the index tests: HFA (Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm [SITA] standard strategy) and CMP (Zippy Estimation by Sequential Testing [ZEST] strategy), 24-2 grid. The reference test for GON was specialist evaluation of fundus photographs or OCT, independent of the visual field (VF). For both devices, linear regression was used to calculate the sensitivity decrease with age in the normal group to compute pointwise total deviation (TD) values and mean deviation (MD). We derived 5% and 1% pointwise normative limits. The MD and the total number of TD values below 5% (TD 5%) or 1% (TD 1%) limits per field were used as classifiers. Main Outcome Measures: We used partial receiver operating characteristic (pROC) curves and partial area under the curve (pAUC) to compare the diagnostic precision of the devices. Pointwise mean absolute deviation and Bland\u2013Altman plots for the mean sensitivity (MS) were computed to assess test\u2013retest variability. Results: Retinal sensitivity was generally lower with CMP, with an average mean difference of 1.85\u00b10.06 decibels (dB) (mean \u00b1 standard error, P < 0.001) in healthy subjects and 1.46\u00b10.05 dB (mean \u00b1 standard error, P < 0.001) in patients with glaucoma. Both devices showed similar discriminative power. The MD metric had marginally better discrimination with CMP (pAUC difference \u00b1 standard error, 0.019\u00b10.009, P = 0.035). The 95% limits of agreement for the MS were reduced by 13% in CMP compared with HFA in participants with glaucoma and by 49% in normal participants. Mean absolute deviation was similar, with no significant differences. Conclusions: Relative diagnostic precision of the 2 devices is equivalent. Test\u2013retest variability of MS for CMP was better than for HFA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Algorithms", "Area Under Curve", "Case-Control Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Glaucoma, Open-Angle", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Fibers", "Optic Nerve Diseases", "Reproducibility of Results", "Retina", "Retinal Ganglion Cells", "ROC Curve", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053839805", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56681936600": {"Name": "Montesano G.", "AuthorID": "56681936600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6506256494": {"Name": "Fogagnolo P.", "AuthorID": "6506256494", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "University of Milan \u2013 ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo"}, "57078136300": {"Name": "Rossetti L.M.", "AuthorID": "57078136300", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "University of Milan \u2013 ASST Santi Paolo e Carlo"}, "55881690500": {"Name": "Bryan S.R.", "AuthorID": "55881690500", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City, University of London, Optometry and Visual Sciences"}, "54790536300": {"Name": "Crabb D.P.", "AuthorID": "54790536300", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City, University of London, Optometry and Visual Sciences"}, "7004460319": {"Name": "Garway-Heath D.F.", "AuthorID": "7004460319", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6507657212": {"Name": "Oddone F.", "AuthorID": "6507657212", "AffiliationID": "60103773", "AffiliationName": "G.
