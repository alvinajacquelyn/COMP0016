In particular, we investigate labour market data in the past two decades for the Enlarged Europe and adopt a variable accounting for the idiosyncratic severity shock of the crisis. This time-varying and country-specific crisis variable enables us to test empirically and in a novel way the joint impact of labour market policies and the economic crisis on labour market dynamics even when accounting for common macro shocks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crisis", "Labour market policies", "Unemployment", "Youth unemployment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925940011", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"56500692800": {"Name": "Dal Bianco S.", "AuthorID": "56500692800", "AffiliationID": "60002826", "AffiliationName": "London Metropolitan University"}, "13606033800": {"Name": "Bruno R.", "AuthorID": "13606033800", "AffiliationID": "114950149", "AffiliationName": "Rodolfo De Benedetti Foundation"}, "24774145900": {"Name": "Signorelli M.", "AuthorID": "24774145900", "AffiliationID": "60003003", "AffiliationName": "University of Perugia"}}}
