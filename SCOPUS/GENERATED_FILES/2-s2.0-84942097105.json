All rights reserved.Aims Genetic mouse models have yielded conflicting conclusions about the role of PI3K\u03b1 in heart physiology: specifically, the question of whether PI3K\u03b1 has a direct role in regulating myocardial contractility. This has led to concerns that PI3K inhibitors currently in clinical trials for cancer may potentiate cardiotoxicity. Here we seek to clarify the role of PI3K\u03b1 in normal heart physiology and investigate changes in related signalling pathways. Methods and results Targeted deletion of PI3K\u03b1 and PI3K\u03b2 in the heart with a tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombinase transgene caused transient heart dysfunction in all genotypes, but only PI3K\u03b1 deletion prevented functional recovery. Reduction in tamoxifen dosing allowed for maintained gene deletion without any cardiomyopathy, possibly through activation of survival signalling through the related ERK pathway. Similarly, mice with PI3K\u03b1 deletion induced by constitutively active Cre recombinase had normal heart function. Insulin-mediated activation of Akt, a marker of PI3K\u03b1 activity, was impaired with increased ERK1/2 activation in PI3K\u03b1 mutant hearts. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K\u03b1 with BYL-719 also caused impaired insulin signalling in murine and human cardiomyocytes as well as in vivo in mice, with increased fasting blood glucose levels, but did not affect myocardial contractility as determined by echocardiography and invasive pressure-volume loop analysis. Conclusion Our results show that PI3K\u03b1 does not directly regulate myocardial contractility, but is required for recovery from tamoxifen/ Cre toxicity. The important role for PI3K\u03b1 in insulin signalling and recovery from tamoxifen/Cre toxicity justifies caution when using PI3K\u03b1 inhibitors in combination with other cardiovascular comorbidities and cardiotoxic compounds in cancer patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiomyocytes", "Contractility", "Cre recombinase", "Insulin", "PI3K"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genotype", "Heart Diseases", "Insulin", "Integrases", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myocardial Contraction", "Myocardium", "Phenotype", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Signal Transduction", "Tamoxifen", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942097105", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55327834700": {"Name": "McLean B.A.", "AuthorID": "55327834700", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "35168473800": {"Name": "Basu R.", "AuthorID": "35168473800", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "35478318300": {"Name": "Kassiri Z.", "AuthorID": "35478318300", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "6603892354": {"Name": "Oudit G.Y.", "AuthorID": "6603892354", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "6506196125": {"Name": "Zhabyeyev P.", "AuthorID": "6506196125", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "36143179700": {"Name": "Patel V.B.", "AuthorID": "36143179700", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "34977285600": {"Name": "Parajuli N.", "AuthorID": "34977285600", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "55790896200": {"Name": "DesAulniers J.", "AuthorID": "55790896200", "AffiliationID": "60030835, 60111305", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute, University of Alberta"}, "57203560195": {"Name": "Murray A.G.", "AuthorID": "57203560195", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of Alberta"}, "7004331309": {"Name": "Vanhaesebroeck B.", "AuthorID": "7004331309", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
