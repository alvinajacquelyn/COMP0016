Journal of Biogeography Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim: There has been recent interest in the origin and assembly of continental biotas based on densely sampled species-level clades, however, studies from African freshwaters are few so that the commonality of macroevolutionary patterns and processes among continental clades remain to be tested. Within the Afrotropics, the Congo Basin contains the highest diversity of riverine fishes, yet it is unclear how this fauna was assembled. To address this, and the diversification dynamics of a continental radiation, we focus on African Mastacembelus spiny eels. Location: Afrotropical freshwaters. Methods: The most complete molecular phylogeny to date was reconstructed for African spiny eels. Divergence times were estimated applying a Bayesian relaxed clock comparing fossil and geological calibrations across nuclear and mitochondrial trees. Biogeographic reconstructions, applying a dispersal\u2013extinction\u2013cladogenesis model and lineage diversification dynamics were examined. Results: Spiny eels originated in Asia and colonized Africa c. 15.4 Ma (95% HPD: 23.9\u20138.8 Ma) from which their subsequent radiation across the Afrotropics was best fitted by a constant rate model. Ancestral state estimation identified multiple colonization events into the Congo Basin, whereas all other regions were likely to have been colonized once indicating considerable geographic constraints. Application of the fossil calibration gave similar age estimates across datasets, whereas a geological calibration estimated considerably older nuclear divergences. Main conclusions: Despite profound environmental events during the evolutionary history of the group, there is no evidence for rapid lineage diversification. This finding supports several recent studies on tropical continental radiations that contrast to the common pattern of density-dependent diversification. We further show that dispersal has occurred into, as well as out of the Congo Basin, indicating the importance of this region in the generation of biodiversity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biogeography", "Congo Basin", "continental radiation", "dispersal", "diversification dynamics", "Lake Tanganyika", "Mastacembelidae", "molecular dating"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020439545", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"]], "AuthorData": {"36061648200": {"Name": "Day J.J.", "AuthorID": "36061648200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "56893687600": {"Name": "Fages A.", "AuthorID": "56893687600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "57212204327": {"Name": "Brown K.J.", "AuthorID": "57212204327", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, The Natural History Museum"}, "55966095800": {"Name": "Vreven E.J.", "AuthorID": "55966095800", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven, Laboratory of Biodiversity and Evolutionary Genomics"}, "6603582681": {"Name": "Stiassny M.L.J.", "AuthorID": "6603582681", "AffiliationID": "60011425", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ichthyology, American Museum of Natural History"}, "6701803471": {"Name": "Bills R.", "AuthorID": "6701803471", "AffiliationID": "60012233", "AffiliationName": "South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity"}, "7005547242": {"Name": "Friel J.P.", "AuthorID": "7005547242", "AffiliationID": "60025371", "AffiliationName": "Alabama Museum of Natural History, The University of Alabama"}, "6602183330": {"Name": "R\u00fcber L.", "AuthorID": "6602183330", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ecology and Evolution, University of Bern"}}}
