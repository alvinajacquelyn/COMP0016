The animal had abscessation of the deep right cervical lymph node, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. The S. pyogenes strain isolated from the lesions, peritoneal and pleural cavities was characterised as emm 28, which can be associated with invasive disease in humans. This is the first known report of S. pyogenes in a hedgehog and in any free-living wild animal that has been confirmed by gene sequencing. As close associations between wild hedgehogs and people in England are common, we hypothesise that this case might have resulted from anthroponotic infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anthroponosis", "anthroponotic", "European hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus)", "reverse zoonosis", "Streptococcus pyogenes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Wild", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "England", "Hedgehogs", "Streptococcal Infections", "Streptococcus pyogenes", "Zoonoses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953260371", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57039138300": {"Name": "Franklinos L.", "AuthorID": "57039138300", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57213854763": {"Name": "John S.", "AuthorID": "57213854763", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "56039471800": {"Name": "Hopkins T.", "AuthorID": "56039471800", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "8944571900": {"Name": "Lawson B.", "AuthorID": "8944571900", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "7004989765": {"Name": "Efstratiou A.", "AuthorID": "7004989765", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "7103228035": {"Name": "Macgregor S.", "AuthorID": "7103228035", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Living Collections, Zoological Society of London"}}}
