Survey results in our study and elsewhere show strong gender disparities in anticipated pursuit of Physics after completion of compulsory education. In order to explore the constructions of gender and Physics underlying these trends, we focus on qualitative interview data, applying Foucaultian analysis of discourse to investigate gendered narratives underpinning adolescents\u2019 and their parents\u2019 articulations. This analysis reveals three key discourses at work on the topic of women\u2019s access to Physics: (a) equality of opportunity, (b) continued gender discrimination in and around Physics, and (c) Physics as quintessentially masculine. We additionally identify five distinct narratives supporting the discourse of physics as masculine. These various discourses and narratives are interrogated, and their implications explored. We conclude that it is only by disrupting prevalent constructions of the Physical sciences as a masculine and \u201chard\u201d domain will we increase the presence of women in the sector. Working with young people to analyse and deconstruct the discursive assumptions made in relation to gender and Physics, as well as further work to increase accessibility and broaden representation in Physics, may be fruitful ways to challenge these longstanding associations between Physics and masculinity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education policy", "Femininity", "Gender", "Gender equality", "Masculinity", "Physics", "STEM"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986320374", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"7102276052": {"Name": "Francis B.", "AuthorID": "7102276052", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7103359770": {"Name": "Archer L.", "AuthorID": "7103359770", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education & Professional Studies, King\u2019s College London"}, "57190948899": {"Name": "Moote J.", "AuthorID": "57190948899", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education & Professional Studies, King\u2019s College London"}, "16202360400": {"Name": "DeWitt J.", "AuthorID": "16202360400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education & Professional Studies, King\u2019s College London"}, "57191069735": {"Name": "MacLeod E.", "AuthorID": "57191069735", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education & Professional Studies, King\u2019s College London"}, "57190951064": {"Name": "Yeomans L.", "AuthorID": "57190951064", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education & Professional Studies, King\u2019s College London"}}}
