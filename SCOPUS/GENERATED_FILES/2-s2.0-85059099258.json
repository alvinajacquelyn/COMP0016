They are designed and fabricated on a flexible substrate, and their performance are verified through measurement for both flat and curved configurations. The efficiency is investigated with respect to power density. It is observed that the proposed systems can achieve high conversion efficiency for low input power while at the same time occupying a compact footprint areas. In addition, the output DC power by harvester system using multi-resonator array is compered to a system with a single resonator. The measurement results demonstrate that an enhancement in the performance of up to 4 times are achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electromagnetic energy harvesting and wireless power transmission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy Harvester", "Flexible substrate", "High conversion efficiency", "Input power", "Power densities", "Resonator arrays", "Small loops", "Wireless power transmission"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059099258", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"57195323079": {"Name": "Aljaloud K.", "AuthorID": "57195323079", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, Roberts Building, University College London"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, Roberts Building, University College London"}}}
