The data available from commercial growers, however, is of variable duration, due to commercial considerations. We employ a recently proposed regression technique termed Variable-Domain Functional Regression in order to be able to accommodate these irregular-length datasets. In this way, we are able to quantify the contribution of covariates such as temperature, humidity and water spraying volumes across the growing process, and for different lengths of growing processes. Our results indicate that optimal oxygen and temperature levels vary across the growing cycle and we propose environmental schedules for these covariates to optimise overall yields.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Agaricus", "Agricultural Irrigation", "Crops, Agricultural", "Humidity", "Models, Statistical", "Regression Analysis", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030461029", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55843384500": {"Name": "Panayi E.", "AuthorID": "55843384500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Sciences, University College London"}, "55764426800": {"Name": "Peters G.", "AuthorID": "55764426800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Sciences, University College London"}, "57195951884": {"Name": "Kyriakides G.", "AuthorID": "57195951884", "AffiliationID": "119546140", "AffiliationName": "Kyiakides Mushrooms Ltd."}}}
