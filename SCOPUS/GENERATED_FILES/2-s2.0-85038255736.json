A good patrolling strategy is required to minimise the average time lag between two consecutive visits to hotspots, as well as coordinating multiple patrollers and imparting unpredictability in patrol routes. Previous studies have designed different police patrol strategies for routing police patrol, but these strategies have difficulty in generalising to real patrolling and meeting various requirements. In this research we develop a new police patrolling strategy based on Bayesian method and ant colony algorithm. In this strategy, virtual marker (pheromone) is laid to mark the visiting history of each crime hotspot, and patrollers continuously decide which hotspot to patrol next based on pheromone level and other variables. Simulation results using real data testifies the effective, scalable, unpredictable and extensible nature of this strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038255736", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57191834457": {"Name": "Chen H.", "AuthorID": "57191834457", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "35200522100": {"Name": "Cheng T.", "AuthorID": "35200522100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57197263285": {"Name": "Wise S.", "AuthorID": "57197263285", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "SpaceTimeLab, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
