Therefore, keeping the joints fully functional is of utmost importance to ensure a desired structural performance of timber buildings under various actions. Since replacement of damaged parts of an existing structure is expensive and in many cases very difficult to perform in situ, retrofitting to avoid failure becomes an increasingly widespread strategy. In this paper, the capacity and failure mechanisms of single notch joints before and after a simple retrofitting intervention by means of self-tapping screws were investigated. To this end, a series of tests were carried out during the 5th COST FP 1101 Training School, held in University of Minho, Portugal. The joints were first tested under compression, and the load-bearing capacity values obtained at the end of tests were compared to the capacity values calculated using theoretical models proposed in a variety of national codes. Then, tested joints were retrofitted using self-tapping screws. The retrofitting strategy aimed to prevent failure mechanism that was shown to dominate joints\u2019 behaviour in the unreinforced state, rather than to increase the load-bearing capacity or stiffness. The impact of retrofitting on the joints\u2019 performance was discussed and the success of the proposed intervention was further debated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Retrofitting", "Self-tapping screws", "Single notch joints", "Traditional carpentry joints"], "IndexKeywords": ["Capacity value", "Existing structure", "Failure mechanism", "Load-bearing capacity", "Self-tapping screws", "Structural behaviour", "Structural performance", "Timber buildings"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051134338", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"55753073100": {"Name": "\u0160obra K.", "AuthorID": "55753073100", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "57205673372": {"Name": "de Rijk R.", "AuthorID": "57205673372", "AffiliationID": "60032882", "AffiliationName": "Eindhoven University of Technology"}, "56254804900": {"Name": "Akta\u015f Y.D.", "AuthorID": "56254804900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57057706300": {"Name": "Avez C.", "AuthorID": "57057706300", "AffiliationID": "60010758", "AffiliationName": "University of Mons"}, "56530862700": {"Name": "Burawska I.", "AuthorID": "56530862700", "AffiliationID": "60085173", "AffiliationName": "Warsaw University of Life Sciences"}, "56228789000": {"Name": "Branco J.M.", "AuthorID": "56228789000", "AffiliationID": "60020475", "AffiliationName": "ISISE, University of Minho"}}}
