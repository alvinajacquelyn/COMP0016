Here, ZnO/ZnMgO core-shell nanowires are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. At growth temperatures above 750 \u00b0C, Mg diffuses into ZnO making heterostructure growth impossible; at lower shell-growth temperatures (500 \u00b0C), the core-shell structure is retained. Even very thin ZnMgO shells show increased intensity photoluminescence (PL) across the ZnO band-gap and a suppression in defect-related PL intensity, relative to plain ZnO nanowires. EDX measurements on shell thickness show a correlation between shell thickness and core diameter which is explained by a simple growth model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["heterostructure", "MBE", "Nanowires", "ZnO"], "IndexKeywords": ["Core shell structure", "Core-shell nanowires", "Functional properties", "Growth modeling", "Nanowire heterostructures", "Shell thickness", "Single nanowires", "Vapour-liquid-solid growths"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062432251", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57192929269": {"Name": "Kennedy O.W.", "AuthorID": "57192929269", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, UCL"}, "7005264376": {"Name": "Warburton P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005264376", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, UCL"}, "56625502800": {"Name": "White E.R.", "AuthorID": "56625502800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Chemistry and Materials, Imperial College London"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.S.P.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Chemistry and Materials, Imperial College London"}}}
