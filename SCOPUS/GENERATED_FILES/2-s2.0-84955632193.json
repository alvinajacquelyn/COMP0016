The microscopic and nanoscopic petrology of organic matter in stromatolitic phosphorites might provide insights into the suite of diagenetic processes that formed these types of stromatolites. Correlated geochemical micro-analyses of the organic matter could also yield molecular, elemental and isotopic compositions and thus insights into the role of specific micro-organisms among these communities. Here, we report on the occurrence of nanoscopic disseminated organic matter in the Palaeoproterozoic stromatolitic phosphorite from the Aravalli Supergroup of north-west India. Organic petrography by micro-Raman and Transmission Electron Microscopy demonstrates syngeneity of the organic matter. Total organic carbon contents of these stromatolitic phosphorite columns are between 0.05 and 3.0 wt% and have a large range of \u03b413Corg values with an average of -18.5\u2030 (1\u03c3 = 4.5\u2030). \u03b415N values of decarbonated rock powders are between -1.2 and +2.7\u2030. These isotopic compositions point to the important role of biological N2-fixation and CO2-fixation by the pentose phosphate pathway consistent with a population of cyanobacteria. Microscopic spheroidal grains of apatite (MSGA) occur in association with calcite microspar in microbial mats from stromatolite columns and with chert in the core of diagenetic apatite rosettes. Organic matter extracted from the stromatolitic phosphorites contains a range of molecular functional group (e.g. carboxylic acid, alcohol, and aliphatic hydrocarbons) as well as nitrile and nitro groups as determined from C- and N-XANES spectra. The presence of organic nitrogen was independently confirmed by a CN- peak detected by ToF-SIMS. Nanoscale petrography and geochemistry allow for a refinement of the formation model for the accretion and phototrophic growth of stromatolites. The original microbial biomass is inferred to have been dominated by cyanobacteria, which might be an important contributor of organic matter in shallow-marine phosphorites.
