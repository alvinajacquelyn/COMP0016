Our result depends on the sign of the Gauss\u2013Bonnet coupling constant \u03b1. When \u03b1> 0 , we find, unlike in general relativity, that the bound is dependent on the stellar structure, in particular the central energy density and we find that stable stellar structures can exist arbitrarily close to the black hole horizon. Thus stable stars can exist with extra mass in this theory compared to five dimensional general relativity. For \u03b1< 0 it is found that the Buchdahl bound is more restrictive than the general relativistic case.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buchdahl inequality", "Gauss\u2013Bonnet gravity", "Mass radius ratio bounds"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975832595", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55015594800": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "55015594800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
