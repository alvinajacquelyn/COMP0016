Defining structural actions (loads) is quite challenging, as structures and infrastructures are associated with volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) environments while in service (as described in Chap. 1). The characteristic values of structural actions must also be determined for safety studies, which represent nominal values during their lifetime. The factored nominal (characteristic) loads associated with VUCA environments are called design loads (actions). This chapter describes computational models for ship structural load analysis in ocean waves, which can be used to determine the nominal values of structural loads in different events. An illustrative example is used to define the design values of structural loads acting on a ship\u2019s hull in ocean waves.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070697419", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.K.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
