The dynamic Attention Theory posits that neural entrainment to musical rhythm results in synchronized oscillations in attention, enhancing perception of other events occurring at the same rate. In this study, this prediction was tested in 10 year-old children by means of a psychoacoustic speech recognition in babble paradigm. It was hypothesized that rhythm effects evoked via a short isochronous sequence of beats would provide optimal word recognition in babble when beats and word are in sync. We compared speech recognition in babble performance in the presence of isochronous and in sync vs. non-isochronous or out of sync sequence of beats. Results showed that (a) word recognition was the best when rhythm and word were in sync, and (b) the effect was not uniform across syllables and gender of subjects. Our results suggest that pure tone beats affect speech recognition at early levels of sensory or phonemic processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory processing", "Dynamic attention theory", "Hearing", "Neural oscillations", "Psychoacoustics", "Rhythm", "Speech processing", "Speech segmentation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024495212", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57189342958": {"Name": "Sidiras C.", "AuthorID": "57189342958", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychoacoustics Laboratory, Neuroscience Division, 3rd Psychiatric Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6602345724": {"Name": "Iliadou V.", "AuthorID": "6602345724", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychoacoustics Laboratory, Neuroscience Division, 3rd Psychiatric Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6507583540": {"Name": "Nimatoudis I.", "AuthorID": "6507583540", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Psychoacoustics Laboratory, Neuroscience Division, 3rd Psychiatric Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "14060798600": {"Name": "Reichenbach T.", "AuthorID": "14060798600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "6701719104": {"Name": "Bamiou D.E.", "AuthorID": "6701719104", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Brain Sciences, UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}}}
