However, there is little evidence-based guidance describing the role of BDR testing in preschool children and it is unclear whether published cut-off values, which are derived from adult data, can be applied to this population. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases (inception\u2014September 2015) for studies reporting response to a bronchodilator in healthy preschool children, response following placebo inhalation, and the diagnostic efficacy of BDR compared with a clinical diagnosis of asthma/recurrent wheezing. Findings: We included 14 studies. Thirteen studies provided BDR data from healthy preschool children. Two studies reported response to placebo in preschool children with asthma/recurrent wheezing. Twelve studies compared BDR measurements from preschool children with asthma/recurrent wheeze to those from healthy children and seven of these studies reported diagnostic efficacy. Significant differences between the BDR measured in healthy preschool children compared with that in children with asthma/recurrent wheeze were demonstrated in some, but not all studies. Techniques such as interrupter resistance, oscillometry, and plethysmography were more consistently successfully completed than spirometry. Between study heterogeneity precluded determination of an optimum technique. Interpretation: There is little evidence to suggest spirometry-based BDR can be used in the clinical assessment of preschool children who wheeze. Further evaluation of simple alternative techniques is required. Future studies should recruit children in whom airways disease is suspected and should evaluate the ability of BDR testing to predict treatment response.
