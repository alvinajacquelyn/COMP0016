All rights reserved.Despite its ubiquitous character and relevance in many branches of science and engineering, nucleation from solution remains elusive. In this framework, molecular simulations represent a powerful tool to provide insight into nucleation at the molecular scale. In this work, we combine theory and molecular simulations to describe urea nucleation from aqueous solution. Taking advantage of well-tempered metadynamics, we compute the free-energy change associated to the phase transition. We find that such a free-energy profile is characterized by significant finite-size effects that can, however, be accounted for. The description of the nucleation process emerging from our analysis differs from classical nucleation theory. Nucleation of crystal-like clusters is in fact preceded by large concentration fluctuations, indicating a predominant two-step process, whereby embryonic crystal nuclei emerge from dense, disordered urea clusters. Furthermore, in the early stages of nucleation, two different polymorphs are seen to compete.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Enhanced sampling", "Molecular dynamics", "Nucleation", "Solution", "Well-tempered metadynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Crystallization", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Solutions", "Thermodynamics", "Urea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920505610", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35741835600": {"Name": "Salvalaglio M.", "AuthorID": "35741835600", "AffiliationID": "60006824", "AffiliationName": "Facolt\u00e0 di Informatica, Istituto di Scienze Computazionali, Universit\u00e0 Della Svizzera Italiana"}, "7005206227": {"Name": "Mazzotti M.", "AuthorID": "7005206227", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Process Engineering, Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule Zurich"}, "35194707100": {"Name": "Perego C.", "AuthorID": "35194707100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Eidgen\u00f6ssiche Technische Hochschule Zurich"}, "55392021300": {"Name": "Giberti F.", "AuthorID": "55392021300", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Eidgen\u00f6ssiche Technische Hochschule Zurich"}, "57203055296": {"Name": "Parrinello M.", "AuthorID": "57203055296", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Eidgen\u00f6ssiche Technische Hochschule Zurich"}}}
