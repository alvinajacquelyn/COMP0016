They have also emerged as an important alternative for fabricating tissue substitutes because they can be molecularly tailored to have vast array of molecular weights, block structures, active functional groups, and mechanical properties. To this date however, there has been very few successful and fully functional synthetic tissue and organ substitutes and with the rapidly spreading 3D printing technology beginning to reshape the tissue engineering and regenerative field, the need for an effective, safe, and bio printable biomaterial is becoming more and more urgent. Here, we have developed a synthetic polymer from controlled living radical polymerisation that can be printed into well-defined structures. The polymer showed low cytotoxicity before and after printing. Additionally, the incorporation of gelatine-methacrylate coated PLGA microparticles within the hydrogel provided cell adhesion surfaces for cell proliferation. The results point to possible application of the microparticle seeded, synthetic hydrogel as a direct printable tissue or organ substitute.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioprinting", "Hydrogels", "Synthetic polymer", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045763353", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"54891724700": {"Name": "Aied A.", "AuthorID": "54891724700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL, 9th floor division of royal free hospital, Division of surgery and interventional science"}, "57221015387": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "57221015387", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL, 9th floor division of royal free hospital, Division of surgery and interventional science"}, "57201692621": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "57201692621", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL, 9th floor division of royal free hospital, Division of surgery and interventional science"}, "57193336110": {"Name": "Baki A.", "AuthorID": "57193336110", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL, 9th floor division of royal free hospital, Division of surgery and interventional science"}, "55911044800": {"Name": "Sigen A.", "AuthorID": "55911044800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "UCL, 9th floor division of royal free hospital, Division of surgery and interventional science"}}}
