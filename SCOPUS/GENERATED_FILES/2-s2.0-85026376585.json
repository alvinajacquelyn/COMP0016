Groups that were given shorter action phases followed by longer transition phases discussed more errors, and produced steeper performance trajectories, which led to more positive group atmospheres, improved coordination, and better final outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Phase duration", "Transition phasis", "Trial and error"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026376585", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"], ["Industrial Relations", "BUSI", "1410"]], "AuthorData": {"57195228986": {"Name": "Goh K.", "AuthorID": "57195228986", "AffiliationID": "60115928, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Richard Ivey School of Business, University of Western Ontario"}, "57126726900": {"Name": "Fisher C.", "AuthorID": "57126726900", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Boston University"}, "56489833200": {"Name": "Sommer S.", "AuthorID": "56489833200", "AffiliationID": "60068566", "AffiliationName": "HEC Paris"}}}
