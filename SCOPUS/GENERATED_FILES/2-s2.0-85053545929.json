Few, however, describe language and life with aphasia from the perspective of the person with aphasia. Across healthcare, patient experience and user involvement are increasingly acknowledged as fundamental to person-centred care. As part of this movement, Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) are being used in service evaluation and planning. Aims: This paper reports the quantitative aspects of a mixed methods study that developed and validated a concise PROM, the Aphasia Impact Questionnaire (AIQ), co-produced with People with Aphasia (PWA). Methods & Procedures: The AIQ was developed within the social model of disability and all stages of the development of the AIQ were performed in partnership with PWA. It was adapted from a pre-existing and lengthier PROM for PWA, the Communication Disability Profile. The first iterations of the AIQ focused on domains of communication, participation and well-being/emotional state. Subsequently the AIQ was extended to include additional items relating to reading and writing (AIQ-21). The research design was iterative. Initially, concurrent validity, internal consistency, and sensitivity of the AIQ-prototype were obtained. The AIQ-prototype was modified to become the AIQ-21. Statistical testing with a new group of PWA was performed, investigating internal consistency and concurrent validity of the AIQ-21. Outcomes & Results: Results for both the AIQ-prototype and AIQ-21 showed statistically significant concurrent validity and good internal consistency. Repeated measurement using the AIQ-prototype demonstrated statistically significant change after PWA accessed a community intervention. Conclusions: The AIQ-21 is a PROM that has great potential to be one of the core set of aphasia tests for clinical and research use. Results can be used alongside language assessment to enable person-centred goal setting and partnership working for people with aphasia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIQ", "Aphasia", "assessment", "co-production", "patient-reported-outcome-measures", "reliability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053545929", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["LPN and LVN", "NURS", "2912"]], "AuthorData": {"6505737707": {"Name": "Swinburn K.", "AuthorID": "6505737707", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language & Cognition, Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57203912426": {"Name": "Pearce Willis E.", "AuthorID": "57203912426", "AffiliationID": "105876631", "AffiliationName": "Formerly Connect, Connect- the communication disability network"}, "56499351000": {"Name": "McVicker S.J.", "AuthorID": "56499351000", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Division of Language & Communication Science, City, University of London"}, "7006621998": {"Name": "Best W.", "AuthorID": "7006621998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language & Cognition, Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57203917835": {"Name": "Beeke S.", "AuthorID": "57203917835", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language & Cognition, Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57203913660": {"Name": "Ledingham K.", "AuthorID": "57203913660", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language & Cognition, Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57203912055": {"Name": "Sweeney J.", "AuthorID": "57203912055", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language & Cognition, Division of Psychology & Language Sciences, University College London"}, "55894023100": {"Name": "Cruice M.", "AuthorID": "55894023100", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Division of Language & Communication Science, City, University of London"}, "57203031534": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "57203031534", "AffiliationID": "60030469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s Public Health, Facility of health Science, University of Hull"}}}
