However, person-centered accounts of moral judgment suggest that a motivation to infer the moral character of others can itself impact on an evaluation of their choices. Building on this person-centered account, we examine whether inferences about agents\u2019 moral character shape the sensitivity of moral judgments to the consequences of agents\u2019 choices, and agents\u2019 role in the causation of those consequences. Participants observed and judged sequences of decisions made by agents who were either bad or good, where each decision entailed a trade-off between personal profit and pain for an anonymous victim. Across trials we manipulated the magnitude of profit and pain resulting from the agent's decision (consequences), and whether the outcome was caused via action or inaction (causation). Consistent with previous findings, we found that moral judgments were sensitive to consequences and causation. Furthermore, we show that the inferred character of an agent moderated the extent to which people were sensitive to consequences in their moral judgments. Specifically, participants were more sensitive to the magnitude of consequences in judgments of bad agents\u2019 choices relative to good agents\u2019 choices. We discuss and interpret these findings within a theoretical framework that views moral judgment as a dynamic process at the intersection of attention and social cognition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blame", "Character", "Moral judgment", "Morality", "Omission bias", "Praise"], "IndexKeywords": ["Choice Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Morals", "Social Behavior", "Social Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020126397", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56435337700": {"Name": "Siegel J.Z.", "AuthorID": "56435337700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "24450177000": {"Name": "Crockett M.J.", "AuthorID": "24450177000", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Yale University"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing, University College London"}}}
