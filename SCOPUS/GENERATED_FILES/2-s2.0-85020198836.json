Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 license\u03b3-Secretases are a family of intramembrane cleaving aspartyl proteases and important drug targets in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we generated mice deficient for all \u03b3-secretases in the pyramidal neurons of the postnatal forebrain by deleting the three anterior pharynx defective 1 (Aph1) subunits (Aph1abc cKO Cre+). The mice show progressive cortical atrophy, neuronal loss, and gliosis. Interestingly, this is associated with more than 10-fold accumulation of membrane-bound fragments of App, Aplp1, Nrg1, and Dcc, while other known substrates of \u03b3-secretase such as Aplp2, Lrp1, and Sdc3 accumulate to lesser extents. Despite numerous reports linking neurodegeneration to accumulation of membrane-bound App fragments, deletion of App expression in the combined Aph1 knockout does not rescue this phenotype. Importantly, knockout of only Aph1a- or Aph1bc-secretases causes limited and differential accumulation of substrates. This was not associated with neurodegeneration. Further development of selective Aph1-\u03b3-secretase inhibitors should be considered for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Aph1 subunit", "selective inhibition", "side effects", "\u03b3-Secretase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Disease Models, Animal", "Endopeptidases", "Histocytochemistry", "Immunohistochemistry", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Prosencephalon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020198836", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"56038725500": {"Name": "Acx H.", "AuthorID": "56038725500", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven Department for Neurosciences, Leuven Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (LIND) and Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, University of Leuven"}, "6603064153": {"Name": "Serneels L.", "AuthorID": "6603064153", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven Department for Neurosciences, Leuven Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (LIND) and Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, University of Leuven"}, "36896901600": {"Name": "Radaelli E.", "AuthorID": "36896901600", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven Department for Neurosciences, Leuven Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (LIND) and Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, University of Leuven"}, "49961970100": {"Name": "Pepermans E.", "AuthorID": "49961970100", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven Department for Neurosciences, Leuven Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (LIND) and Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, University of Leuven"}, "6505758892": {"Name": "Ch\u00e1vez-Guti\u00e9rrez L.", "AuthorID": "6505758892", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven Department for Neurosciences, Leuven Institute for Neurodegenerative Disorders (LIND) and Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, University of Leuven"}, "7006241978": {"Name": "De Strooper B.", "AuthorID": "7006241978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Dementia Research Institute (DRI-UK)"}, "7005810441": {"Name": "Muyldermans S.", "AuthorID": "7005810441", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "8622097100": {"Name": "Vincke C.", "AuthorID": "8622097100", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "7403120092": {"Name": "M\u00fcller U.", "AuthorID": "7403120092", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology (IPMB), University of Heidelberg"}}}
