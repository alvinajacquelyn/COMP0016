Methods: This retrieval study involved nine magnetically controlled growth rods, of a single design, revised from five patients for metal staining, progression of scoliosis, swelling, fractured actuator pin, and final fusion. All the retrieved rods were radiographed and assessed macroscopically and microscopically for material loss. Two implants were further analysed using micro-CT scanning and then sectioned to allow examination of the internal mechanism. No funding was obtained to analyse these implants. There were no potential conflicts interests. Results: Plain radiographs revealed that three out of nine retrieved rods had a fractured pin. All had evidence of surface degradation on the extendable telescopic rod. There was considerable corrosion along the internal mechanism. Conclusions: We found that a third of the retrieved magnetically controlled growth rods had failed due to pin fracture secondary to corrosion of the internal mechanism. We recommend that surgeons consider that any inability of magnetically controlled growth rods to distract may be due to corrosive debris building up inside the mechanism, thereby preventing normal function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corrosion", "Early onset scoliosis", "Magnetically controlled growth rods", "Spine implants", "Spine retrievals"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bone Nails", "Child", "Corrosion", "Device Removal", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Phenomena", "Male", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Prosthesis Failure", "Retrospective Studies", "Scoliosis", "Spine", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009841617", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"55235216800": {"Name": "Panagiotopoulou V.C.", "AuthorID": "55235216800", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "55982205200": {"Name": "Whittaker R.K.", "AuthorID": "55982205200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.S.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, University College London"}, "56089319500": {"Name": "Henckel J.", "AuthorID": "56089319500", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "15042533600": {"Name": "Leong J.J.H.", "AuthorID": "15042533600", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7202408761": {"Name": "Tucker S.K.", "AuthorID": "7202408761", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6505934139": {"Name": "Ember T.", "AuthorID": "6505934139", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy\u2019s and St Thomas NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
