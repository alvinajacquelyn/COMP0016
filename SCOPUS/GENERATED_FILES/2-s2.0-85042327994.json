The precuneus (PC) has been recently emphasized as a key area for the memory impairment observed in early AD, likely due to disconnection mechanisms within large-scale networks such as the default mode network (DMN). Using a multimodal approach we investigated in a two-week, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded trial the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the PC on cognition, as measured by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite in 14 patients with early AD (7 females). TMS combined with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) was used to detect changes in brain connectivity. We found that rTMS of the PC induced a selective improvement in episodic memory, but not in other cognitive domains. Analysis of TMS-EEG signal revealed an increase of neural activity in patients' PC, an enhancement of brain oscillations in the beta band and a modification of functional connections between the PC and medial frontal areas within the DMN. Our findings show that high-frequency rTMS of the PC is a promising, non-invasive treatment for memory dysfunction in patients at early stages of AD. This clinical improvement is accompanied by modulation of brain connectivity, consistently with the pathophysiological model of brain disconnection in AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AD", "Memory", "Precuneus", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Beta Rhythm", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Memory, Episodic", "Parietal Lobe", "Prodromal Symptoms", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042327994", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36866518200": {"Name": "Koch G.", "AuthorID": "36866518200", "AffiliationID": "60005075", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Unit, Tor Vergata Policlinic"}, "26533986400": {"Name": "Bonn\u00ec S.", "AuthorID": "26533986400", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "6504027566": {"Name": "Pellicciari M.C.", "AuthorID": "6504027566", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "55613454600": {"Name": "Casula E.P.", "AuthorID": "55613454600", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "57200725983": {"Name": "Esposito R.", "AuthorID": "57200725983", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "56316725000": {"Name": "Ponzo V.", "AuthorID": "56316725000", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "55751811700": {"Name": "Picazio S.", "AuthorID": "55751811700", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "6603888625": {"Name": "Di Lorenzo F.", "AuthorID": "6603888625", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "36461399500": {"Name": "Motta C.", "AuthorID": "36461399500", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "57194787766": {"Name": "Maiella M.", "AuthorID": "57194787766", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Non Invasive Brain Stimulation Unit/Department of Behavioral and Clinical Neurology, Santa Lucia Foundation IRCCS"}, "7005822633": {"Name": "Martorana A.", "AuthorID": "7005822633", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "35228717800": {"Name": "Caltagirone C.", "AuthorID": "35228717800", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}, "56647524300": {"Name": "Mancini M.", "AuthorID": "56647524300", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Laboratory, Santa Lucia Foundation, IRCCS"}, "8266381200": {"Name": "Serra L.", "AuthorID": "8266381200", "AffiliationID": "60014416", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Laboratory, Santa Lucia Foundation, IRCCS"}, "6701548417": {"Name": "Bozzali M.", "AuthorID": "6701548417", "AffiliationID": "60017317, 60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex"}, "7102675596": {"Name": "Marra C.", "AuthorID": "7102675596", "AffiliationID": "60031984", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Neurology Department, Catholic University of Rome"}, "6603813790": {"Name": "Cercignani M.", "AuthorID": "6603813790", "AffiliationID": "60017317, 60100018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex"}}}
