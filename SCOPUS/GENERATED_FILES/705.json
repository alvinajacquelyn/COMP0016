Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground and Aim: Dental trauma is a common public health issue that can be associated with high costs and lifelong treatment. Children and parents should have the correct information regarding its management to reduce the potential long-term sequelae. Understanding their information seeking behaviour is therefore important to ensure that they are able to access, understand and retain the relevant information. The aim of this study was to investigate (a) the different ways that patients undertaking treatment for dental trauma, and their parents, look for relevant information, (b) their information needs, and (c) their preferred format of information. Material and Methods: This was a two-phase study: Phase I involved in-depth interviews with 10 patients who were currently undergoing treatment for dental trauma, and 11 parents. In phase II, the themes and sub-themes identified from the interviews were used to develop patient and parent questionnaires, which were distributed to all trauma patients and parents who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and who were attending the dental clinics from March to May 2014. Results: Patients and parents had different concerns immediately following the trauma, during treatment and in the long term, and they wanted different forms of information to answer their concerns. Reliability was the main issue about trusting the information available in the Internet, social media and other online sources. Therefore, patients preferred to obtain information verbally from their dentist, while parents preferred written information. Conclusion: Patients and parents have different information needs, and these also vary at different stages of treatment. It is therefore important to customize the way information is provided for each group accordingly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "dental trauma", "in-depth interviews", "information provision", "information seeking behaviour", "knowledge"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Humans", "Information Seeking Behavior", "Parents", "Patients", "Reproducibility of Results", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087909623", "SubjectAreas": [["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"]], "AuthorData": {"57218098173": {"Name": "Bamashmous N.", "AuthorID": "57218098173", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Dentistry Department, King Abdulaziz University"}, "7201937126": {"Name": "Cunningham S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201937126", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Orthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "14010574900": {"Name": "Parekh S.", "AuthorID": "14010574900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Paediatric Dentistry, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
