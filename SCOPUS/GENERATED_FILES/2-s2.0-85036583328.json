Selective reaction of primary alcohols in the presence of secondary alcohols is possible. The reaction of secondary alcohols proceeds stereospecifically with inversion of configuration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Iminium salts", "Inversion of configuration", "Primary alcohols", "Rapid conversion", "Secondary alcohols", "Selective reactions", "Thioiminium salts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036583328", "SubjectAreas": [["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"34978548000": {"Name": "Grounds H.", "AuthorID": "34978548000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "55448069700": {"Name": "Ermanis K.", "AuthorID": "55448069700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "56815165800": {"Name": "Newgas S.", "AuthorID": "56815165800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}, "7201467488": {"Name": "Porter M.", "AuthorID": "7201467488", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Building"}}}
