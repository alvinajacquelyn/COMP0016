As part of their function, they must withstand extrinsic mechanical stresses applied at high strain rates. However, little is known about how monolayers respond to mechanical deformations. Here, by subjecting suspended epithelial monolayers to stretch, we find that they dissipate stresses on a minute timescale and that relaxation can be described by a power law with an exponential cut-off at timescales larger than about 10 s. This process involves an increase in monolayer length, pointing to active remodelling of cellular biopolymers at the molecular scale during relaxation. Strikingly, monolayers consisting of tens of thousands of cells relax stress with similar dynamics to single rounded cells, and both respond similarly to perturbations of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. By contrast, cell\u2013cell junctional complexes and intermediate filaments do not relax tissue stress, but form stable connections between cells, allowing monolayers to behave rheologically as single cells. Taken together, our data show that actomyosin dynamics governs the rheological properties of epithelial monolayers, dissipating applied stresses and enabling changes in monolayer length.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Epithelial monolayers", "External environments", "High strain rates", "Intermediate filaments", "Mechanical deformation", "Mechanical stress", "Molecular scale", "Rheological property"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065785571", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55940612800": {"Name": "Khalilgharibi N.", "AuthorID": "55940612800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computation, Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "35108927300": {"Name": "Fouchard J.", "AuthorID": "35108927300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56255236900": {"Name": "Yonis A.", "AuthorID": "56255236900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57199315939": {"Name": "Harris A.", "AuthorID": "57199315939", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering and Biophysics Program, University of California, Berkeley"}, "57208458979": {"Name": "Charras G.", "AuthorID": "57208458979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "57208770259": {"Name": "Barrientos R.", "AuthorID": "57208770259", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "55619600200": {"Name": "Asadipour N.", "AuthorID": "55619600200", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Laboratori de C\u00e0lcul Num\u00e8ric (LaC\u00e0N), Department of Mathematics, Escola d\u2019Enginyeria Barcelona Est (EEBE), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya\u2014Barcelona Tech (UPC)"}, "56535382600": {"Name": "Mosaffa P.", "AuthorID": "56535382600", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Laboratori de C\u00e0lcul Num\u00e8ric (LaC\u00e0N), Department of Mathematics, Escola d\u2019Enginyeria Barcelona Est (EEBE), Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya\u2014Barcelona Tech (UPC)"}, "7402874069": {"Name": "Mu\u00f1oz J.J.", "AuthorID": "7402874069", "AffiliationID": "60116923", "AffiliationName": "Barcelona Graduate School of Mathematics (BGSMath)"}, "57205443564": {"Name": "Duda M.", "AuthorID": "57205443564", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "55459037100": {"Name": "Mao Y.", "AuthorID": "55459037100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7201826445": {"Name": "Baum B.", "AuthorID": "7201826445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "56526936500": {"Name": "Bonfanti A.", "AuthorID": "56526936500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, Cambridge University"}, "23008923600": {"Name": "Kabla A.", "AuthorID": "23008923600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, Cambridge University"}, "57199478003": {"Name": "Fujita Y.", "AuthorID": "57199478003", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University"}, "55827028600": {"Name": "Miodownik M.", "AuthorID": "55827028600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
