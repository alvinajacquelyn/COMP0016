Users first harvest energy from the downlink WPT, and then use the harvested energy for uplink transmission. We adopt the downlink received signal power (DRSP) based user association to maximize the harvested energy, and address the impact of massive MIMO on the user association. By using new statistical properties, we then obtain the exact expressions for the average harvested energy and the average uplink achievable rate of a user in such networks. Numerical results corroborate our analysis and demonstrate that compared to deploying more small cells, the use of a large number of antennas is more appealing since it brings in significant increase in the harvested energy of the HetNets. In addition, results illustrate that serving more users in the massive MIMO aided macrocells decreases the harvested energy and the uplink achievable rate of the HetNets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Heterogeneous network (HetNets)", "Multiple input multiple output antennas", "Numerical results", "Statistical properties", "Up-link transmissions", "User associations", "Wireless power transfer", "Wireless power transfer (WPT)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006009618", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56021641700": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "56021641700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56072896600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56072896600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}}}
