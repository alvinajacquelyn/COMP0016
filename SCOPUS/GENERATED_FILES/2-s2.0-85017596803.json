All rights reserved.In this chapter, we will particularly focus on topography, both at micro- and nanoscale, and its effect on cellular functions. An overview on the way cells recognize these specific clues guiding their future behavior, together with the different fabrication techniques utilized to create those specific topographic features, are presented. Additionally, various in vitro and in vivo interventions utilizing the concepts of manipulating surface topography in order to guide specific biological phenomena (like cell spreading, proliferation, and differentiation), together with guided host response (such as inflammatory reaction and implant integration), are also explained with specific case studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Host response", "In vitro", "In vivo", "Microtopography", "Modification", "Nanotopography", "Surface"], "IndexKeywords": ["Host response", "In-vitro", "In-vivo", "Micro topography", "Modification", "Nanotopographies"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017596803", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"24070966200": {"Name": "Kalaskar D.", "AuthorID": "24070966200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55706838700": {"Name": "Alshomer F.", "AuthorID": "55706838700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
