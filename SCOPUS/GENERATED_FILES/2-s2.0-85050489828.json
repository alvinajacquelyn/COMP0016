Often believed to be a prodromal feature of neurodegenerative disease, anxiety may also be an independent risk factor for dementia, operationally defined here as preceding dementia diagnosis by \u226510 years. Design: A systematic review of the literature on anxiety diagnosis and long-term risk for dementia was performed following published guidelines. Setting and participants: Medline, PsycINFO and Embase were searched for peer-reviewed journals until 8 March 2017. Publications reporting HR/OR for all-cause dementia based on clinical criteria from prospective cohort or case-control studies were selected. Included studies measured clinically significant anxiety in isolation or after controlling for symptoms of depression, and reported a mean interval between anxiety assessment and dementia diagnosis of at least 10 years. Methodological quality assessments were performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Outcome measure HR/OR for all-cause dementia. Results: Searches yielded 3510 articles, of which 4 (0.02%) were eligible. The studies had a combined sample size of 29 819, and all studies found a positive association between clinically significant anxiety and future dementia. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, a meta-analysis was not conducted. Conclusions: Clinically significant anxiety in midlife was associated with an increased risk of dementia over an interval of at least 10 years. These findings indicate that anxiety may be a risk factor for late-life dementia, excluding anxiety that is related to prodromal cognitive decline. With increasing focus on identifying modifiable risk factors for dementia, more high-quality prospective studies are required to clarify whether clinical anxiety is a risk factor for dementia, separate from a prodromal symptom.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety disorders", "dementia", "epidemiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Anxiety", "Australia", "Dementia", "Humans", "Prospective Studies", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050489828", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57190288321": {"Name": "Gimson A.", "AuthorID": "57190288321", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "57192154383": {"Name": "Schlosser M.", "AuthorID": "57192154383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "37012043900": {"Name": "Huntley J.D.", "AuthorID": "37012043900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "23992626100": {"Name": "Marchant N.L.", "AuthorID": "23992626100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
