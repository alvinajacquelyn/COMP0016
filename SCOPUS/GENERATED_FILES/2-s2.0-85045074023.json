She was diagnosed with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) as a consequence of poor adherence to anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic and anti-retroviral medications. PRES is a rare condition, which may cause cortical blindness; contrary to its name it is not always reversible. Rapid diagnosis and aggressive management of underlying causes facilitate reversibility of PRES. We also summarise the literature on patients with HIV and PRES.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral therapy", "HIV", "posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Brain", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045074023", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57189636803": {"Name": "Pool E.", "AuthorID": "57189636803", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57202670153": {"Name": "Porte M.", "AuthorID": "57202670153", "AffiliationID": "112681382", "AffiliationName": "York Teaching Hospital"}, "57201484199": {"Name": "Durham N.", "AuthorID": "57201484199", "AffiliationID": "112681382", "AffiliationName": "York Teaching Hospital"}, "57201480463": {"Name": "Urwin S.", "AuthorID": "57201480463", "AffiliationID": "112681382", "AffiliationName": "York Teaching Hospital"}, "23668261400": {"Name": "Laboi P.", "AuthorID": "23668261400", "AffiliationID": "112681382", "AffiliationName": "York Teaching Hospital"}, "7403518878": {"Name": "Martin F.", "AuthorID": "7403518878", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
