This is one of the first reports of using an SHS derived powder for gas sensing applications. The gas response of the materials was tested against a wide range of environmentally important gases (ethanol, ethane, ethene, ammonia, propane, and CO) at a range of different operating temperatures. Good gas response behavior was found with excellent selectivity toward ethanol, particularly in the case of the LaFeO3 sensor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ceramics", "Chemical and biological sensors", "Ferrite films", "Thick film sensors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ceramics", "Chemical and biological sensors", "Ferrite films", "Gas sensing applications", "Gas sensing properties", "Operating temperature", "Self-propagating high temperature synthesis", "Thick film sensors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84909606345", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56035779700": {"Name": "Sathiwitayakul T.", "AuthorID": "56035779700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56035171900": {"Name": "Newton E.", "AuthorID": "56035171900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7102379362": {"Name": "Kuznetsov M.", "AuthorID": "7102379362", "AffiliationID": "108345687", "AffiliationName": "All-Russian Research Institute on Problems of Civil Defence, Emergencies of Emergency Control Ministry of Russia"}, "7801602505": {"Name": "Binions R.", "AuthorID": "7801602505", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary, University of London"}}}
