Children & Society published by National Children's Bureau and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This study reports on the questions, thoughts and feelings of children aged 4\u20139 conceived by donor insemination to single mothers. Fifty-one mothers and 47 children from the same families were each administered a semi-structured interview. Mothers generally reported that while children either lack understanding, or have not yet been told, about their donor conception, they may be thinking and talking about the absence of a father. Most children did not mention either donor conception or father absence and reported positive feelings about their families and friendships. Possible explanations for the discrepancy between mothers\u2019 and children's reports are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children's perspectives", "donor conception", "father absence", "solo mother"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016519319", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"57052627600": {"Name": "Zadeh S.", "AuthorID": "57052627600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "24168523400": {"Name": "Freeman T.", "AuthorID": "24168523400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "7006221075": {"Name": "Golombok S.", "AuthorID": "7006221075", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}}}
