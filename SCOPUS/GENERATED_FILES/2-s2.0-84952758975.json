Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.The band gap of earth-abundant ZnSnN2 can be tuned between 1 and 2 eV by varying the growth conditions and resulting cation disorder. The optical absorption edges and carrier densities fall between model curves for cation-ordered orthorhombic and disordered wurtzite ZnSnN2. Hard X-ray photoemission spectra suggest different degrees of cation disorder from comparison with hybrid DFT-calculated densities of states.", "AuthorKeywords": ["band gap", "energy materials", "semiconductors", "thin films", "ZnSnN2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cation disorder", "Densities of state", "Energy materials", "Growth conditions", "Hard X-ray photoemission", "Model curve", "Optical absorption edge", "ZnSnN2"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952758975", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"6603739582": {"Name": "Veal T.D.", "AuthorID": "6603739582", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, Department of Physics, School of Physical Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "57217847654": {"Name": "Linhart W.M.", "AuthorID": "57217847654", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Stephenson Institute for Renewable Energy, Department of Physics, School of Physical Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "55490499600": {"Name": "Feldberg N.", "AuthorID": "55490499600", "AffiliationID": "60032083", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University at Buffalo"}, "55746184600": {"Name": "Quackenbush N.F.", "AuthorID": "55746184600", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Binghamton University"}, "8861646500": {"Name": "Piper L.F.J.", "AuthorID": "8861646500", "AffiliationID": "60020273", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Binghamton University"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "23021088400": {"Name": "Durbin S.M.", "AuthorID": "23021088400", "AffiliationID": "60000879", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Western Michigan University"}}}
