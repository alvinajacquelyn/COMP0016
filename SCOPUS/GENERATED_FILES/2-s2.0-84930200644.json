KGaA, Weinheim.Host-guest inclusion complexes are abundant in molecular systems and of fundamental importance in living organisms. Realizing a colloidal analogue of a molecular dynamic inclusion complex is challenging because inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) with a well-defined cavity and portal are difficult to synthesize in high yield and with good structural fidelity. Herein, a generic strategy towards the fabrication of dynamic 1:1 inclusion complexes of metal nanoparticles inside oxide nanocups with high yield (>70 %) and regiospecificity (>90 %) by means of a reactive double Janus nanoparticle intermediate is reported. Experimental evidence confirms that the inclusion complexes are formed by a kinetically controlled mechanism involving a delicate interplay between bipolar galvanic corrosion and alloying-dealloying oxidation. Release of the NP guest from the nanocups can be efficiently triggered by an external stimulus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["host-guest systems", "inclusion complexes", "Janus nanoparticles", "nanocups", "nanostructures"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental evidence", "Host-guest inclusion complexes", "Host-guest system", "Inclusion complex", "Inorganic nanoparticle", "Janus nanoparticles", "Kinetically controlled", "nanocups", "Gold", "Nanostructures", "Oxides", "Particle Size", "Silicon Dioxide", "Silver", "Surface Properties", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930200644", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56158519600": {"Name": "Alarc\u00f5n-Correa M.", "AuthorID": "56158519600", "AffiliationID": "60015815", "AffiliationName": "Inst. for Phys.
