Learning the characteristics of the variable input neural signals and adapting the functionality of the sorting process can improve the accuracy. An adaptive spike sorting processor is presented accounting for the variation in the input signal noise characteristics and the variable difficulty in the selection of the spike characteristics, which significantly improves the accuracy. The adaptive spike processor was fabricated in 180-nm CMOS technology for proof of concept. It performs conditional detection, alignment, adaptive feature extraction, and online clustering with sorting threshold self-tuning capability. The chip was tested under different input signal conditions to demonstrate its adaptation capability providing a median classification accuracy of 84.5% and consuming 148 \u03bcW from a 1.8 V supply voltage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive decomposition", "brain machine interface", "feature extraction", "processor", "reconfigurable embedded frames", "signal model learning", "spike sorting", "unsupervised clustering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation models", "Adaptive decomposition", "Brain machine interface", "processor", "Reconfigurable", "Signal modeling", "Spike-sorting", "Unsupervised clustering", "Action Potentials", "Animals", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047180729", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57198744432": {"Name": "Zamani M.", "AuthorID": "57198744432", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15922999900": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "15922999900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
