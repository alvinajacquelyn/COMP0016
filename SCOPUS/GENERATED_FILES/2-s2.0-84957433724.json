Study Design and Setting Using the Canadian cystic fibrosis registry (CCFR), the median age of survival was calculated using both the Cox proportional hazards (PH) and the life-table methods. Through simulations, we examined how the median age of survival would change when: (1) patients were excluded, (2) death dates were inaccurate, (3) patients were lost to follow-up, (4) entire years with no clinic visits were excluded even if the patient had a visit in subsequent years, and (5) censoring patients at their date of transplant. Simulations were run assuming 5-35% of data were affected by each scenario. Results Over the period 2009-2013, there were 4,666 individuals in the CCFR with 240 deaths. The observed median age of survival calculated by the Cox PH method was 50.9 [95% confidence interval (CI): 47.4, 54.3] and 50.5 from the life-table method (95% CI: 47.5, 53.5). Censoring patients at their transplant date overestimated the median age of survival by 7.2 years (58.1; 95% CI: 53.3, 64.7). Simulations determined that by missing just 15% of deaths, the median age of survival can be overestimated by 3.5 years (54.4; 95% CI: 54.2, 56.1), and having 25% of patients lost to follow-up can underestimate the median age of survival by 3.3 years (47.6; 95% CI: 46.8, 47.7). Conclusion We present several recommendations to assist national cystic fibrosis registries in calculating and reporting the median age of survival in a standardized fashion. It is imperative to state the statistical method used as well as the proportion lost to follow-up and the treatment of missing data and transplanted patients. Registries must be diligent in their data collection as incomplete data can lead to overestimation and underestimation of survival.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cox proportional hazards", "Cystic fibrosis", "International comparisons", "Life tables", "Registry", "Survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Canada", "Cystic Fibrosis", "Humans", "Life Tables", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Registries", "Survival Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957433724", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"54793496300": {"Name": "Sykes J.", "AuthorID": "54793496300", "AffiliationID": "60017018", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respirology, St. Michael's Hospital"}, "55642233800": {"Name": "Stephenson A.L.", "AuthorID": "55642233800", "AffiliationID": "60085802, 60017018, 60085801", "AffiliationName": "Keenan Research Centre, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute, St Michael's Hospital"}, "22636433100": {"Name": "Stanojevic S.", "AuthorID": "22636433100", "AffiliationID": "60193840, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto"}, "7005849325": {"Name": "Goss C.H.", "AuthorID": "7005849325", "AffiliationID": "60033293", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine and Pediatrics, University of Washington Medical Center"}, "8972975500": {"Name": "Quon B.S.", "AuthorID": "8972975500", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia"}, "56680181600": {"Name": "Marshall B.C.", "AuthorID": "56680181600", "AffiliationID": "100323254", "AffiliationName": "Cystic Fibrosis Foundation"}, "56074409400": {"Name": "Petren K.", "AuthorID": "56074409400", "AffiliationID": "100323254", "AffiliationName": "Cystic Fibrosis Foundation"}, "56989679800": {"Name": "Ostrenga J.", "AuthorID": "56989679800", "AffiliationID": "100323254", "AffiliationName": "Cystic Fibrosis Foundation"}, "56074770700": {"Name": "Fink A.", "AuthorID": "56074770700", "AffiliationID": "100323254", "AffiliationName": "Cystic Fibrosis Foundation"}, "56522801000": {"Name": "Elbert A.", "AuthorID": "56522801000", "AffiliationID": "100323254", "AffiliationName": "Cystic Fibrosis Foundation"}}}
