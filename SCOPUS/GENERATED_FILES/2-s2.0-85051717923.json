We propose in the present paper such a magnetoelectric ceramic system for an application as miniaturized resonator antenna in GHz range. BaTi1-xFexO3-x/2 (0 \u2264 x \u2264 0.02) polycrystalline ceramics have been produced by solid state reaction. X-ray diffraction analysis and Rietveld refinement have shown that Fe doping of BaTiO3 lattice produces a transition from tetragonal crystalline symmetry (for x \u2264 0.01) to a superposition of tetragonal and hexagonal phases for the compositions x = 0.015 and 0.02. As result of Fe addition, the Curie temperature of BaTi1-xFexO3-x/2 ceramics exhibit a shift from 127 \u00b0C towards lower values and reaches 85 \u00b0C for x = 0.02. A competition between weak ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic character as a function of composition and temperature is determined both by the presence of transition metal ion and of the oxygen vacancies. Due to its electromagnetic properties, an optimized composition x = 0.01 was used for producing a miniaturized antenna which was found to show a frequency dependent S11 response similar to the simulated one.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ba(Ti1-xFex)O3-x/2 ceramics", "Dielectric properties", "Dielectric resonator antenna", "Diluted magnetic oxides", "EPR spectra"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dielectric resonator antennas", "Diluted magnetic oxide", "Electromagnetic properties", "EPR spectra", "Ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic", "Functional characterization", "Magnetoelectric devices", "Polycrystalline ceramics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051717923", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"24528845600": {"Name": "Gheorghiu F.", "AuthorID": "24528845600", "AffiliationID": "60014596", "AffiliationName": "Research Center on Advanced Materials and Technologies, Sciences Department, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi"}, "16647543800": {"Name": "Tascu S.", "AuthorID": "16647543800", "AffiliationID": "60014596", "AffiliationName": "Research Center on Advanced Materials and Technologies, Sciences Department, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi"}, "6508243157": {"Name": "Ciomaga C.", "AuthorID": "6508243157", "AffiliationID": "60014596", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Physics, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi"}, "55865561500": {"Name": "Simenas M.", "AuthorID": "55865561500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Lab. of Microwave Spectroscopy, Radio Physics Department, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "8299944700": {"Name": "Kalendra V.", "AuthorID": "8299944700", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Lab. of Microwave Spectroscopy, Radio Physics Department, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "7003687871": {"Name": "Banys J.", "AuthorID": "7003687871", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Lab. of Microwave Spectroscopy, Radio Physics Department, Faculty of Physics, Vilnius University"}, "35263736500": {"Name": "Airimioaei M.", "AuthorID": "35263736500", "AffiliationID": "60014596", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi"}, "6505633935": {"Name": "Avadanei O.", "AuthorID": "6505633935", "AffiliationID": "60014596", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi"}, "7004155983": {"Name": "Mitoseriu L.", "AuthorID": "7004155983", "AffiliationID": "60014596", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iasi"}, "7102437311": {"Name": "Qiao S.", "AuthorID": "7102437311", "AffiliationID": "60020880, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State key laboratory of functional materials for informatics, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
