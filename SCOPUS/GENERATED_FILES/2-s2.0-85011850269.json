A. Barth Verlag in Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.Purpose: Blockade of the angiotensin-renin system, with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), has been shown to improve cardiac outcomes following myocardial infarction and delay progression of heart failure. Acromegaly is associated with a disease-specific cardiomyopathy, the pathogenesis of which is poorly understood. Methods: The cardiac indices of patients with active acromegaly with no hypertension (Group A, n=4), established hypertension not taking ACEi/ARBs (Group B, n=4) and established hypertension taking ACEi/ARBs (Group C, n=4) were compared using cardiac magnetic imaging. Results: Patients taking ACEi/ARBs had lower end diastolic volume index (EDVi) and end systolic volume index (ESVi) than the other 2 groups ([C] 73.24 vs. [A] 97.92 vs. [B] 101.03 ml/m 2, ANOVA p=0.034, B vs. C p<0.01). Groups A and B had EDVi and ESVi values at the top of published reference range values; Group C had values in the middle of the range. Conclusion: Acromegaly patients on ACEi/ARBs for hypertension demonstrate improved cardiac indices compared to acromegaly patients with hypertension not taking these medications. Further studies are needed to determine if these drugs have a beneficial cardiac effect in acromegaly in the absence of demonstrable hypertension.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acromegaly", "cardiac magnetic resonance", "pituitary", "renin-angiotensin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acromegaly", "Adult", "Aged", "Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Female", "Heart", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Renin-Angiotensin System"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011850269", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57198922220": {"Name": "Thomas J.D.J.", "AuthorID": "57198922220", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56451044500": {"Name": "Dattani A.", "AuthorID": "56451044500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7004190977": {"Name": "Korbonits M.", "AuthorID": "7004190977", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Endocrinology, Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "53865866400": {"Name": "Zemrak F.", "AuthorID": "53865866400", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7003737440": {"Name": "Burchell T.", "AuthorID": "7003737440", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7202449475": {"Name": "Davies L.C.", "AuthorID": "7202449475", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6603201686": {"Name": "Akker S.A.", "AuthorID": "6603201686", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "36611833200": {"Name": "Kaplan F.J.L.", "AuthorID": "36611833200", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Lister Hospital"}, "36185394100": {"Name": "Khoo B.", "AuthorID": "36185394100", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Royal Free Campus, UCL Medical School"}, "55882708600": {"Name": "Aylwin S.", "AuthorID": "55882708600", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, King's College Hospital"}, "35401342800": {"Name": "Grossman A.B.", "AuthorID": "35401342800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University of Oxford"}}}
