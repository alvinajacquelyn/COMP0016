It considers the mechanisms of circulation and reception that shaped responses to Hegelianism within the broader context of European debates on La Scienza Nuova. These developments largely directed Neapolitans\u2019 understanding of Hegel\u2019s ideas and encouraged the merging of local thought with wider European currents. Neapolitan Hegelians engaged very extensively with the works of French and northern Italian authors, such as Jules Michelet and Carlo Cattaneo, who had understood Vico as a proponent of an absolute concept of historical time that neatly dovetailed with the philosophical preoccupations common among German idealists. The article makes a case for a transnational understanding of Neapolitan Hegelianism, arguing that this current of thought did not merely stem from the passive absorption of Hegel\u2019s ideas, but emerged as the synthesis of a local and a European dimension of philosophy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["circulation", "conceptual", "Europe", "Hegel", "history", "intellectual history", "Naples", "philosophy", "reception", "transnational", "Vico"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064916523", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57208497238": {"Name": "de Arcangelis A.", "AuthorID": "57208497238", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
