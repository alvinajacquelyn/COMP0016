All rights reserved.We explore the relationship between materials properties and Earth structure from the bottom up: moving systematically from the structure and bonding of single crystals to the elasticity of rocks to the interpretation of seismological observations and models. Our approach is that of the forward problem, beginning with the fundamentals of mineral elasticity, including the basic theory of lattice vibrations, dispersion and normal modes, and its relationship to the various experimental probes of elasticity, to the thermodynamic properties of minerals, and to the underlying quantum mechanics of bonding. The discussion of the elasticity of rocks includes an outline of the theory of composites as applied to the elastic constants and the essentials of anelasticity. This leads naturally to a consideration of scaling in length and time from the laboratory to the Earth. We end with thoughts on the prospects for the inverse problem, that is, formally inverting seismological observations for quantities such as the temperature and compositional fields at depth via knowledge of materials properties.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attenuation", "Composites", "Earth's core", "Earth's mantle", "Elasticity", "High pressure", "Lattice dynamics", "Mantle discontinuities", "Phase transitions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978911200", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7003403662": {"Name": "Stixrude L.", "AuthorID": "7003403662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7101977125": {"Name": "Jeanloz R.", "AuthorID": "7101977125", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "University of California at Berkeley"}}}
