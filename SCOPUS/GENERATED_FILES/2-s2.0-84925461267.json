It is an important part of the structure of the academic work of SRTL community that at the end of each conference, a small group of discussants are given the space to present their reflections and reactions with the aim of raising questions and issues which may carry forward into the future work of the community of researchers. Traditionally, they have the freedom to choose the perspectives from which they do this, and this paper has been developed in the same spirit. At SRTL7, the authors of this paper addressed issues on which they have been working for some time, namely, task design and the emergence of big data and are now able to offer a commentary from these two perspectives on what might be learnt from the papers in this special issue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big data", "Samples", "Task design"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925461267", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8970762600": {"Name": "Ainley J.", "AuthorID": "8970762600", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "University of Leicester School of Education"}, "35450624700": {"Name": "Gould R.", "AuthorID": "35450624700", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "55999846500": {"Name": "Pratt D.", "AuthorID": "55999846500", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
