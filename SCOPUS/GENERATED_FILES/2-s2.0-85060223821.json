Kyklos Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.This paper examines the effect of extending the primary school day on maternal labor supply. I exploit the staggered nature of the recent German reform to extend school hours and assess whether or not gaining access to a full day school increases the likelihood that mothers enter into the labor market or extend their hours worked if already employed. I use the German Socio-Economic Panel data set (GSOEP) and link it to a self-collected school-level data set with geographical information software (GIS). Using a flexible difference-in-difference approach in the estimation of linear probability and logit models, I find that the policy has a statistically significant effect of approximately five percentage points at the extensive margin, drawing more women into the labor market. I find no significant effect of the policy at the intensive margin; women who were already working do not extend their hours worked. This has implications for policies to extend the school day that do not correspond to the working day.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060223821", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"57195424413": {"Name": "Shure N.", "AuthorID": "57195424413", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
