In our paediatric tertiary referral hospital, we have come across several types of implanted devices that were not confidently recognised or identified by front-line staff and were often only identified by discussion with the patient, family or clinical team. This pictorial review highlights the appearance of nonvascular devices on paediatric radiographs in order to help clinicians identify the most frequent complications and to improve awareness of these important devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Devices", "Equipment failure", "Implants", "Radiography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Humans", "Prostheses and Implants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930209750", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56663031400": {"Name": "Urquia A.", "AuthorID": "56663031400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57197637137": {"Name": "Watson T.", "AuthorID": "57197637137", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
