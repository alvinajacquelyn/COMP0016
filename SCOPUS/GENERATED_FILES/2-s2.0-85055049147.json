Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Sleep problems relate to brain changes in aging and disease, but the mechanisms are unknown. Studies suggest a relationship between \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) accumulation and sleep, which is likely augmented by interactions with multiple variables. Here, we tested how different cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for brain pathophysiology, brain atrophy, memory function, and depressive symptoms predicted self-reported sleep patterns in 91 cognitively healthy older adults over a 3-year period. The results showed that CSF levels of total-and phosphorylated (P) tau, and YKL-40-a marker of neuroinflammation/astroglial activation-predicted poor sleep in A\u03b2 positive older adults. Interestingly, although brain atrophy was strongly predictive of poor sleep, the relationships between CSF biomarkers and sleep were completely independent of atrophy. A joint analysis showed that unique variance in sleep was explained by P-tau and the P-tau \u00d7 A\u03b2 interaction, memory function, depressive symptoms, and brain atrophy. The results demonstrate that sleep relates to a range of different pathophysiological processes, underscoring the importance of understanding its impact on neurocognitive changes in aging and people with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrophy", "Depression", "Memory", "MRI", "YKL-40"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Atrophy", "Brain", "Chitinase-3-Like Protein 1", "Encephalitis", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Status Schedule", "Middle Aged", "Neurofilament Proteins", "Sleep Wake Disorders", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055049147", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6601949049": {"Name": "Fjell A.M.", "AuthorID": "6601949049", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "56798381200": {"Name": "Idland A.V.", "AuthorID": "56798381200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Oslo Delirium Research Group, Department of Geriatric Medicine, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo"}, "35198893100": {"Name": "Sala-Llonch R.", "AuthorID": "35198893100", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Center for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition, University of Oslo"}, "6603364599": {"Name": "Walhovd K.B.", "AuthorID": "6603364599", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "55946965200": {"Name": "Watne L.O.", "AuthorID": "55946965200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo"}, "7006685915": {"Name": "Wyller T.B.", "AuthorID": "7006685915", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital"}, "55135406900": {"Name": "Borza T.", "AuthorID": "55135406900", "AffiliationID": "60108588", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Old Age Psychiatric Research, Innlandet Hospital Trust"}, "6603569408": {"Name": "Br\u00e6khus A.", "AuthorID": "6603569408", "AffiliationID": "60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Oslo University Hospital"}, "57193912871": {"Name": "Lona T.", "AuthorID": "57193912871", "AffiliationID": "60069317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Diakonhjemmet Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
