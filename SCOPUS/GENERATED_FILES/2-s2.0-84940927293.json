The aim of the present research was to explore the association between ethnicity and care pathway through child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), in terms of reason for referral and case closure, in children presenting with emotional problems. A sample of N = 11,592 children from 26 CAMHS was taken from a national routinely collected dataset (56 % female; 7 % aged 0\u20135 years, 40 % 6\u201312 years, 53 % 13\u201318 years, and <1 % 19\u201325 years). Multinomial logistic regressions showed that BAME children were consistently more likely to be referred to CAMHS through education, social, and other services than primary care, compared to White British children (odds ratio (OR) = 1.52\u20139.96, p < .001) and they were less likely to end treatment due to child and family non-attendance (OR = 0.59\u20130.79, p < .05). Similar to adults, children from BAME groups may be more likely to access CAMHS through compulsory than voluntary care pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CAMHS", "Care pathway", "Emotional disorder", "Ethnic minority", "Referral", "Service use"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Health Services", "Adult", "Affective Symptoms", "Child", "Child Health Services", "Child, Preschool", "Databases, Factual", "Emotions", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Mental Health Services", "Referral and Consultation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940927293", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56339951200": {"Name": "Edbrooke-Childs J.", "AuthorID": "56339951200", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "41861122100": {"Name": "Deighton J.", "AuthorID": "41861122100", "AffiliationID": "60170329, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Evidence Based Practice Unit, UCL and Anna Freud Centre"}, "6701596440": {"Name": "Wolpert M.", "AuthorID": "6701596440", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium, Anna Freud Centre"}, "56583391100": {"Name": "Newman R.", "AuthorID": "56583391100", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium, Anna Freud Centre"}, "56281139400": {"Name": "Fleming I.", "AuthorID": "56281139400", "AffiliationID": "60170329", "AffiliationName": "Child Outcomes Research Consortium, Anna Freud Centre"}}}
