Methods: A retrospective review of all new appointments with 11 community-based specialist optometrists in glaucoma (SOG) was conducted. There are two tiers of SOG, whereby tier 2 SOGs have increased levels of autonomy. All optometrist assessments were reviewed by a consultant ophthalmologist, and levels of agreement were calculated for assessment of optic nerve head appearance, Humphrey visual field test interpretation, diagnosis and outcome. Results: 1639 new patients were assessed by SOGs over a 4-year period. The median waiting time for patients from referral to SOG assessment was 0 days (IQR 0-56), and from SOG assessment to consultant review in a virtual clinic was 12 days (IQR 8-18days). After first appointment, over 60% of patients were classified as low-risk and remained within the SOG scheme. Rates of frank disagreement between SOG and consultant regarding diagnosis and proposed outcome were 5.6 and 10.4%, respectively, for tier 2 SOGs and 15.3 and 28.6%, respectively, for tier 1 SOGs. Conclusions: The SOG scheme demonstrates acceptable levels of accuracy between SOG and glaucoma consultant. This scheme allows many stable low-risk patients to remain out of hospital eye department outpatient clinics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community", "Glaucoma", "Optometrist", "Shared care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anterior Chamber", "Community Health Services", "Corneal Pachymetry", "Decision Making", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glaucoma", "Gonioscopy", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Ocular Hypertension", "Ophthalmology", "Optometry", "Patient Care Team", "Referral and Consultation", "Retrospective Studies", "Specialization", "Tonometry, Ocular", "Visual Field Tests", "Visual Fields", "Waiting Lists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930718778", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56030249800": {"Name": "Roberts H.W.", "AuthorID": "56030249800", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Eye Department, Peterborough and Stamford NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough City Hospital"}, "57190444742": {"Name": "Syam P.", "AuthorID": "57190444742", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Eye Department, Peterborough and Stamford NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough City Hospital"}, "8623187400": {"Name": "Dhingra S.", "AuthorID": "8623187400", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Eye Department, Peterborough and Stamford NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough City Hospital"}, "8397445500": {"Name": "Ramirez-Florez S.", "AuthorID": "8397445500", "AffiliationID": "60170290", "AffiliationName": "Eye Department, Peterborough and Stamford NHS Foundation Trust, Peterborough City Hospital"}, "42762003400": {"Name": "Rughani K.", "AuthorID": "42762003400", "AffiliationID": "60177696", "AffiliationName": "Specsavers (Optometrists)"}}}
