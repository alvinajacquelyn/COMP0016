We introduce a reconstruction formula for c that is based on the Boundary Control method and incorporates features also from the complex geometric optics solutions approach. Moreover, we show that the reconstruction formula is locally Lipschitz stable for a low frequency component of c\u22122under the assumption that the Riemannian manifold (M, c\u22122dx2) has a strictly convex function with no critical points. That is, we show that for all bounded C2 neighborhoods U of c, there is a C1neighborhood V of c and constants C,R > 0 such that (formula presented) for all c \u2208 U \u2229 V , where \u039b is the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map corresponding to the wave speed c and |\u00b7|\u2217 is a norm capturing certain regularity properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inverse problems", "Lipschitz stability", "Wave equation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944754979", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36617560900": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "36617560900", "AffiliationID": "60026610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, Clemson University"}, "36241865400": {"Name": "Oksanen L.", "AuthorID": "36241865400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
