{"Title": "Normal Electrooculography in Best Disease and Autosomal Recessive Bestrophinopathy", "Year": 2018, "Source": "Retina", "Volume": "38", "Issue": 2, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 379, "PageEnd": 386, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.1097/IAE.0000000000001523", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85047298225&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 Ophthalmic Communications Society, Inc.Purpose: To evaluate the electrooculogram (EOG) in a large series of patients with Best disease and autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy. Methods: A retrospective review of consecutive cases at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom. Patients with Best disease or autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy who, after electrophysiologic testing, had a normal or atypical EOG light rise were identified. Main outcome measure was EOG amplitude, clinical phenotype and genotype. Results: One hundred thirteen patients were identified with likely disease-causing sequence variants in BEST1 (99 Best disease and 14 autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy). Electrooculograms had been performed in 75 patients. Twenty patients (27%) had no detectable light rise (Arden ratio of 100%) and 49 (65%) had Arden ratios of between 100% to 165%. Six patients (8%) were found to have an EOG light rise of >165%. No cases demonstrated significant interocular asymmetry in EOG amplitude. Conclusion: The current work provides significant clinical evidence that the EOG phenotype in Best disease and autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy is more variable than currently appreciated. As a normal EOG may occur in the presence of a classical fundus appearance, the consequences of BEST1 mutation may be independently expressed, possibly mediated through differential effects on intracellular calcium homeostasis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autosomal bestrophinopathy", "Best disease", "Best-related retinopathy", "electrooculography", "retina", "retinal dystrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bestrophins", "Dark Adaptation", "DNA", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Electrooculography", "Electroretinography", "Eye Diseases, Hereditary", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Macula Lutea", "Male", "Mutation", "Phenotype", "Reference Values", "Retinal Diseases", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047298225", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36646250000": {"Name": "Khan K.N.", "AuthorID": "36646250000", "AffiliationID": "60020454, 60023959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine, St James' University Hospital"}, "7102202117": {"Name": "Holder G.E.", "AuthorID": "7102202117", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57203259026": {"Name": "Robson A.", "AuthorID": "57203259026", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "56573251100": {"Name": "Moore A.T.", "AuthorID": "56573251100", "AffiliationID": "60031970, 60023691", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, University of California, San Francisco Medical School"}, "57202482672": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "57202482672", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "39961598300": {"Name": "Islam F.", "AuthorID": "39961598300", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
