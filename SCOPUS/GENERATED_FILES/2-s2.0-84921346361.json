The current energy and exergy flows are shown based on a categorisation by climatic regions with the aim of understanding the impact of local characteristics on regional efficiencies. Due to the limited data currently available, the study is supported by the development of a detailed archetype-based stock model using EnergyPlus as a first law analysis tool combined with an existing exergy analysis method. Twenty-one reference models were created to estimate the electric and gas use in the sector. The results indicate that sectoral energy and exergy annual input are 95.37. PJ and 94.28. PJ, respectively. Regional exergy efficiencies were found to be 17.8%, 16.6% and 23.2% for the hot-dry, hot-humid and temperate climates, respectively. The study concludes that significant potential for improvements still exists, especially in the cases of space conditioning, lighting, refrigeration, and cooking where most exergy destructions occur. Additionally, this work highlights that the method described may be further used to study the impact of large-scale refurbishments and promote national regulations and standards for sustainable buildings that takes into consideration energy and exergy indicators.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bottom-up model", "Energy analysis", "Exergy analysis", "Mexico", "Non-domestic sector", "Stock modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bottom-up modeling", "Domestic sector", "Energy analysis", "Exergy Analysis", "Me-xico"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921346361", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"57215934565": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda Kerdan I.", "AuthorID": "57215934565", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Departamentode Mec\u00e1nicay Energ\u00eda, Institutode Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3nomade M\u00e9xico"}, "6507276018": {"Name": "Ruyssevelt P.", "AuthorID": "6507276018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Energy Institute, University College London"}, "56429668200": {"Name": "Morill\u00f3n G\u00e1lvez D.", "AuthorID": "56429668200", "AffiliationID": "60032442", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Mec\u00e1nica y Energ\u00eda, Instituto de Ingenier\u00eda, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico"}, "35956865000": {"Name": "Raslan R.", "AuthorID": "35956865000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London"}}}
