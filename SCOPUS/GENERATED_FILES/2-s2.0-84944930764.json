One factor contributing to this variability may be the diversity of the BCG strains that are used around the world, in part from genomic changes accumulated during vaccine production and their resulting differences in gene expression. We have compared the genomes and transcriptomes of a global collection of fourteen of the most widely used BCG strains at single base-pair resolution. We have also used quantitative proteomics to identify key differences in expression of proteins across five representative BCG strains of the four tandem duplication (DU) groups. We provide a comprehensive map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variation and insertions and deletions (indels) across fourteen BCG strains. Genome-wide SNP characterization allowed the construction of a new and robust phylogenic genealogy of BCG strains. Transcriptional and proteomic profiling revealed a metabolic remodeling in BCG strains that may be reflected by altered immunogenicity and possibly vaccine efficacy. Together, these integrated-omic data represent the most comprehensive catalogue of genetic variation across a global collection of BCG strains.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acclimatization", "BCG Vaccine", "Cell Wall", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genome, Bacterial", "Humans", "Mycobacterium bovis", "Phylogeny", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Proteomics", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944930764", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"34568022600": {"Name": "Abdallah A.M.", "AuthorID": "34568022600", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Pathogen Genomics Group, Biological, Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "55963500700": {"Name": "Hill-Cawthorne G.A.", "AuthorID": "55963500700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity and School and Public Health, University of Sydney"}, "55484991300": {"Name": "Gao G.", "AuthorID": "55484991300", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Pathogen Genomics Group, Biological, Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "55578549000": {"Name": "Naeem R.", "AuthorID": "55578549000", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Pathogen Genomics Group, Biological, Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "26537186800": {"Name": "Ansari H.", "AuthorID": "26537186800", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Pathogen Genomics Group, Biological, Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "55316911900": {"Name": "Adroub S.A.", "AuthorID": "55316911900", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Pathogen Genomics Group, Biological, Environmental Sciences and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "7004341451": {"Name": "Pain A.", "AuthorID": "7004341451", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Global Station for Zoonosis Control, Global Institution for Collaborative Research and Education (GI-CoRE), Hokkaido University"}, "7103379081": {"Name": "Otto T.D.", "AuthorID": "7103379081", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Pathogen Genomics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "55490333300": {"Name": "Coll F.", "AuthorID": "55490333300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "36026665000": {"Name": "Guerra-Assun\u00e7\u00e3o J.A.", "AuthorID": "36026665000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, QMUL"}, "7003915692": {"Name": "McNerney R.", "AuthorID": "7003915692", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7403216793": {"Name": "Clark T.G.", "AuthorID": "7403216793", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55681754300": {"Name": "Malas T.B.", "AuthorID": "55681754300", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Computational Bioscience Research Center (CBRC), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "6507401951": {"Name": "Verboom T.", "AuthorID": "6507401951", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, VU University Medical Center"}, "23977110500": {"Name": "Ummels R.", "AuthorID": "23977110500", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, VU University Medical Center"}, "7004022195": {"Name": "Bitter W.", "AuthorID": "7004022195", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology and Infection Control, VU University Medical Center"}, "15841049300": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "15841049300", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Bioscience Core Laboratory, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "7006153791": {"Name": "Panigrahi A.K.", "AuthorID": "7006153791", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Bioscience Core Laboratory, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}, "7005066273": {"Name": "Brosch R.", "AuthorID": "7005066273", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Institut Pasteur, Unit for Integrated Mycobacterial Pathogenomics"}, "7102978533": {"Name": "Behr M.A.", "AuthorID": "7102978533", "AffiliationID": "60006558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre"}}}
