Data quality is determined by the type of data, data collection methods and available resources. Data collectors\u2019 views regarding the acceptability of data collection process for validation studies are also important to consider. Aim: To explore data collectors\u2019 views on the acceptability of data collection processes used for a European validation PPS of HAI and antimicrobial use (AMU). Methods: An anonymous online survey was conducted with 67 data collectors from 10 European countries involved in the study. Findings: Twenty-five (64.1%) participants viewed AMU data collection as easy/quite easy whereas only five (12.8%) thought HAI data collection was easy/quite easy. Six (17%) participants indicated that incentives and 21 (56.8%) that disincentives were possibly/definitely present for reporting cases of HAI. Engagement of staff was not thought to have adversely affected data collection as only one (2.6%) and five (15.4%) participants thought involvement of hospital PPS teams and administration was low/very low, respectively. Discussion: Participants believed the approaches used were appropriate but that more training was required prior to data collection, some case definitions should be reviewed and the number of variables reduced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acceptability", "antimicrobial use (AMU)", "Healthcare-associated infection (HAI)", "point prevalence survey (PPS)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964301747", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"8295509800": {"Name": "Price L.", "AuthorID": "8295509800", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Applied Health Research, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "15518913600": {"Name": "Reilly J.", "AuthorID": "15518913600", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Applied Health Research, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "57196395089": {"Name": "Godwin J.", "AuthorID": "57196395089", "AffiliationID": "60007573", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Applied Health Research, Glasgow Caledonian University"}, "26022778100": {"Name": "Cairns S.", "AuthorID": "26022778100", "AffiliationID": "60111371, 60111372", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection Scotland, National Services Scotland"}, "53264392100": {"Name": "Malcolm W.", "AuthorID": "53264392100", "AffiliationID": "60111371, 60111372", "AffiliationName": "Health Protection Scotland, National Services Scotland"}, "7202260726": {"Name": "Hopkins S.", "AuthorID": "7202260726", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "57210548108": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "57210548108", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "35493717000": {"Name": "Cookson B.", "AuthorID": "35493717000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003400221": {"Name": "Lyytik\u00e4inen O.", "AuthorID": "7003400221", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "16023753500": {"Name": "Coignard B.", "AuthorID": "16023753500", "AffiliationID": "60010845", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Veille Sanitaire"}, "7403080130": {"Name": "Hansen S.", "AuthorID": "7403080130", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin"}}}
