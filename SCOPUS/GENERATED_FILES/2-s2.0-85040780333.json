All rights reserved.We report a case of subacute cerebellar infarction mimicking metastasis on prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT. A 77-year-old man with prostate cancer treated with androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy with rising prostate-specific antigen was referred for 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Apart from PSMA-expressing tumor of the left prostate, PSMA PET/CT demonstrated radiotracer uptake in the right cerebellar hemisphere, corresponding to a site of subacute infarction demonstrated on an MRI of the brain performed 35 days previously. As cerebellar infarcts are considerably less common than cerebral infarcts, they may not be anticipated as a potential cause for false-positive radiotracer uptake on PSMA PET.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cerebral metastasis", "ischemic stroke", "MRI", "PET/CT", "PSMA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Biological Transport", "Cerebral Infarction", "Edetic Acid", "Humans", "Male", "Oligopeptides", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040780333", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57200316797": {"Name": "Oh G.", "AuthorID": "57200316797", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Imaging, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}, "16948025200": {"Name": "Miles K.", "AuthorID": "16948025200", "AffiliationID": "60025258", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Imaging, Princess Alexandra Hospital"}}}
