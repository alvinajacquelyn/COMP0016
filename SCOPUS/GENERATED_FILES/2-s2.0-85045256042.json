Patients and methods: Bioinformatic and experimental methods were used to assess the distribution of MSR1 across the genome, evaluate the regulatory potential of such elements and explore the role of MSR1 elements in cancer, particularly non-familial breast cancer and prostate cancer. Results: MSR1s are predominately located at chromosome 19 and are functionally enriched in regulatory regions of the genome, particularly regions implicated in short-range regulatory activities (H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and H3K4me3). MSR1-regulated genes were found to have specific molecular roles, such as serine-protease activity (P=4.80\u00d710-7) and ion channel activity (P=2.7\u00d710-4). The kallikrein locus was found to contain a large number of MSR1 clusters, and at least six of these showed CNV. An MSR1 cluster was identified within KLK14, with 9 and 11 copies being normal variants. A significant association with the 9-copy allele and non-familial breast cancer was found in two independent populations (P=0.004; P=0.03). In the white British population, the minor allele conferred an increased risk of 1.21-3.51 times for all non-familial disease, or 1.7-5.3 times in earlyonset disease. The 9-copy allele was also found to be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in an independent population (odds ratio=1.27-1.56; P=0.009). Conclusions: MSR1 repeats act as molecular switches that modulate gene expression. It is likely that CNV of MSR1 will affect risk of development of various forms of cancer, including that of breast and prostate. The MSR1 cluster at KLK14 represents the strongest risk factor identified to date in non-familial breast cancer and a significant risk factor for prostate cancer. Analysis of MSR1 genotype will allow development of precise stratification of disease risk and provide a novel target for therapeutic agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Gene expression", "Kallikrein genes", "MSR1", "Prostate cancer", "Repeat elements"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of Onset", "Breast Neoplasms", "Case-Control Studies", "Computational Biology", "DNA Copy Number Variations", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Histones", "Humans", "Kallikreins", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Minisatellite Repeats", "Multigene Family", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045256042", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"35084178400": {"Name": "Rose A.M.", "AuthorID": "35084178400", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "11438905600": {"Name": "Chakarova C.F.", "AuthorID": "11438905600", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "22836197000": {"Name": "Shah A.Z.", "AuthorID": "22836197000", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "56894640600": {"Name": "Bhattacharya S.S.", "AuthorID": "56894640600", "AffiliationID": "60012334", "AffiliationName": "Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, CABIMER"}, "57202253534": {"Name": "Krishan A.", "AuthorID": "57202253534", "AffiliationID": "60012334", "AffiliationName": "Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine, CABIMER"}, "55927746700": {"Name": "Moya L.", "AuthorID": "55927746700", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program, School of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology"}, "57193235013": {"Name": "Batra J.", "AuthorID": "57193235013", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Program, School of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology"}, "24586572000": {"Name": "Chambers S.K.", "AuthorID": "24586572000", "AffiliationID": "60033075", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research Centre, Cancer Council Queensland"}, "57202257696": {"Name": "Hollands M.", "AuthorID": "57202257696", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "57202254043": {"Name": "Illingworth J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202254043", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "57214066179": {"Name": "Williams S.M.G.", "AuthorID": "57214066179", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London"}, "57202248626": {"Name": "McCabe H.E.", "AuthorID": "57202248626", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Genetics, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee"}, "57202451180": {"Name": "Berg J.N.", "AuthorID": "57202451180", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Genetics, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee"}, "57203644795": {"Name": "Palmer C.N.A.", "AuthorID": "57203644795", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacogenetics and Pharmacogenomics, Ninewells Hospital and School of Medicine, University of Dundee"}, "35355137200": {"Name": "Chakravarti A.", "AuthorID": "35355137200", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}}}
