All rights reserved.Ceramic and glass materials have been used for the repair and reconstruction of diseased or damaged parts of the musculoskeletal system, such as bones, joints, and teeth, etc. The development of bioceramics has progressed from first generation bioinert ceramics and second generation bioactive ceramics toward third generation bioactive ceramics with regenerative functions. This progress reflects an improved understanding of the interactions between \"foreign\" materials and host tissues. Stem cells, with their self-renewal and multi-differentiation capabilities, are increasingly playing prominent roles in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Recent advances in biomaterial science and engineering aid biomaterial design in directing the growth and differentiation of stem cells. Various technologies have been developed to introduce micro- and nanoscale features as topographical cues in addition to biochemical cues for cells to respond. Therefore, a synergistic combination of bioactive materials and cell therapy offers an attractive approach to promote tissue regeneration; such smart biofunctionalization strategies will continue to play a key role in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. This chapter overviews the design and development of the most commonly used bioactive ceramics for biomedical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioactive glasses and ceramics", "Calcium phosphates", "Hydroxyapatites", "Scaffolds", "Stem cells", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040566128", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"35242219300": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "35242219300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
