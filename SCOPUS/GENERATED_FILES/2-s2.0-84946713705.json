The main hypothesis for the trial is that lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) with selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) as the primary treatment ('Laser-1st') leads to a better health-related quality of life than for those started on IOP-lowering drops as their primary treatment ('Medicine-1st') and that this is associated with reduced costs and improved tolerability of treatment. This paper describes the statistical analysis plan for the study. Methods/Design: The LiGHT trial is an unmasked, multi-centre randomised controlled trial. A total of 718 patients (359 per arm) are being randomised to two groups: medicine-first or laser-first treatment. Outcomes are recorded at baseline and at 6-month intervals up to 36months. The primary outcome measure is health-related quality of life (HRQL) at 36months measured using the EQ-5D-5L. The main secondary outcome is the Glaucoma Utility Index. We plan to analyse the patient outcome data according to the group to which the patient was originally assigned. Methods of statistical analysis are described, including the handling of missing data, the covariates used in the adjusted analyses and the planned sensitivity analyses. Trial registration: The trial was registered with the ISRCTN register on 23/07/2012, number ISRCTN32038223.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ocular hypertension", "Open-angle glaucoma", "Ophthalmology", "Randomised clinical trial", "Statistical analysis plan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Ophthalmic", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Clinical Protocols", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Glaucoma, Open-Angle", "Humans", "Laser Therapy", "Models, Statistical", "Ocular Hypertension", "Ophthalmic Solutions", "Quality of Life", "Research Design", "Time Factors", "Trabeculectomy", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946713705", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55576291300": {"Name": "Vickerstaff V.", "AuthorID": "55576291300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, The Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health"}, "7003730066": {"Name": "Ambler G.", "AuthorID": "7003730066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Statistical Science"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology"}, "8242134200": {"Name": "Xing W.", "AuthorID": "8242134200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology"}, "7004147260": {"Name": "Gazzard G.", "AuthorID": "7004147260", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology"}, "57201589777": {"Name": "Wilson S.", "AuthorID": "57201589777", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7003899659": {"Name": "Broadway D.", "AuthorID": "7003899659", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56953934200": {"Name": "Lim S.", "AuthorID": "56953934200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7103377631": {"Name": "Bourne R.", "AuthorID": "7103377631", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6603075985": {"Name": "Manners T.", "AuthorID": "6603075985", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8528033300": {"Name": "Strouthidis N.", "AuthorID": "8528033300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7005485512": {"Name": "Wormald R.", "AuthorID": "7005485512", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55541432300": {"Name": "Hunter R.", "AuthorID": "55541432300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7201409346": {"Name": "Rubin G.", "AuthorID": "7201409346", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7004460319": {"Name": "Garway-Heath D.", "AuthorID": "7004460319", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57220389523": {"Name": "Buszewicz M.", "AuthorID": "57220389523", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56954048600": {"Name": "Davis A.", "AuthorID": "56954048600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55281043900": {"Name": "Nathwani N.", "AuthorID": "55281043900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "24576952100": {"Name": "Konstantakopoulou E.", "AuthorID": "24576952100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56953766100": {"Name": "Zhou H.", "AuthorID": "56953766100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "8881176800": {"Name": "Jiang Y.", "AuthorID": "8881176800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
