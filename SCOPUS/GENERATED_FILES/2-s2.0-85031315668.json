The present study investigated whether the abociation between poverty and behavior problems during early childhood is mediated simultaneously by perceived parenting, family dysfunction and/or maternal deprebion symptoms. Outcomes measures were high trajectories of physical aggrebion and hyperactivity between 1.5 and 5 years. Poverty was defined as living 2-4 years below the low-income thresholds defined by Statistics Canada. Using data from the first five rounds of the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, logistic regrebions models showed that poverty was abociated with a higher likelihood of being abigned to the high trajectory of physical aggrebion and hyperactivity. Overprotection and maternal deprebion symptoms mediated observed abociations. Interventions targeting maternal deprebion, parenting, and poverty should help reducing children's risk for early behavior problems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hyperactivity", "maternal deprebion", "parenting", "physical aggrebion", "poverty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031315668", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"57189854654": {"Name": "Mazza J.", "AuthorID": "57189854654", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "University of Montreal"}, "7003934654": {"Name": "Zunzunegui M.", "AuthorID": "7003934654", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "University of Montreal"}, "7006183959": {"Name": "C\u00f4t\u00e9 S.", "AuthorID": "7006183959", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "University of Montreal"}, "8369960100": {"Name": "Pingault J.", "AuthorID": "8369960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "9943615100": {"Name": "Booij L.", "AuthorID": "9943615100", "AffiliationID": "60016005", "AffiliationName": "Queen's University"}, "55769906600": {"Name": "Boivin M.", "AuthorID": "55769906600", "AffiliationID": "60032619", "AffiliationName": "University of Laval"}, "57188642378": {"Name": "Tremblay R.", "AuthorID": "57188642378", "AffiliationID": "60016896", "AffiliationName": "Tomsk State University"}, "7401837036": {"Name": "Lambert J.", "AuthorID": "7401837036", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "University College Dublin"}}}
