Overtime, with repeated cycles of loading, accumulation of such injuries can lead to macro-structural failure and frank fracture. There are numerous stress fractures about the foot and ankle of which a trauma and orthopaedic surgeon should be aware. These include: metatarsal, tibia, calcaneus, navicular, fibula, talus, medial malleolus, sesamoid, cuneiform and cuboid. Awareness of these fractures is important as the diagnosis is frequently missed and appropriate treatment delayed. Late identification can be associated with protracted pain and disability, and may predispose to non-union and therefore necessitate operative intervention. This article outlines the epidemiology and risk factors, aetiology, presentation and management of the range of stress fractures in the foot and ankle.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aetiology", "Education", "Foot and ankle", "Management", "Stress fracture"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ankle Injuries", "Calcaneus", "Delayed Diagnosis", "Fibula", "Foot Injuries", "Fractures, Stress", "Humans", "Metatarsal Bones", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Tibia", "Time-to-Treatment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949977563", "SubjectAreas": [["Emergency Medicine", "MEDI", "2711"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56731052700": {"Name": "Welck M.J.", "AuthorID": "56731052700", "AffiliationID": "60003948", "AffiliationName": "Speciality Registrar Trauma & Orthopaedics, West Herts NHS Trust"}, "36640562900": {"Name": "Pastides P.", "AuthorID": "36640562900", "AffiliationID": "60003948", "AffiliationName": "Speciality Registrar Trauma & Orthopaedics, West Herts NHS Trust"}, "57004387400": {"Name": "Hayes T.", "AuthorID": "57004387400", "AffiliationID": "60003948", "AffiliationName": "Core Surgical Trainee, West Herts NHS Trust"}, "57004340700": {"Name": "Khan W.", "AuthorID": "57004340700", "AffiliationID": "116115183", "AffiliationName": "Speciality Registrar Trauma & Orthopaedics, Royal National Orthopaedic NHS Trust"}, "36090381800": {"Name": "Rudge B.", "AuthorID": "36090381800", "AffiliationID": "60003948", "AffiliationName": "Consultant Trauma & Orthopaedics, West Herts NHS Trust"}}}
