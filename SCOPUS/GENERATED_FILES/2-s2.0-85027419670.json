Even though they present a wealth of interesting photophysical properties, these optically dark states significantly limit optoelectronic device performance. Recent advances in emissive charge-transfer molecules have pioneered routes to reduce the energy gap between triplets and \"bright\" singlets, allowing thermal population exchange between them and eliminating a significant loss channel in devices. In conjugated polymers, this gap has proved resistant to modification. Here, we introduce a general approach to reduce the singlet-triplet energy gap in fully conjugated polymers, using a donor-orthogonal acceptor motif to spatially separate electron and hole wave functions. This new generation of conjugated polymers allows for a greatly reduced exchange energy, enhancing triplet formation and enabling thermally activated delayed fluorescence. We find that the mechanisms of both processes are driven by excited-state mixing between \u03c0-\u03c0and charge-transfer states, affording new insight into reverse intersystem crossing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Charge transfer molecules", "Charge transfer state", "Hole wave functions", "Inter-system crossings", "Photophysical properties", "Singlet-triplet energy gap", "Thermal population", "Thermally activated delayed fluorescences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027419670", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"57198058937": {"Name": "Freeman D.M.E.", "AuthorID": "57198058937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57195355193": {"Name": "Forster A.K.", "AuthorID": "57195355193", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56779792400": {"Name": "Fallon K.J.", "AuthorID": "56779792400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202914994": {"Name": "Clarke T.M.", "AuthorID": "7202914994", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36105657800": {"Name": "Musser A.J.", "AuthorID": "36105657800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Hicks Building"}, "56708147700": {"Name": "Stern H.L.", "AuthorID": "56708147700", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "8077782000": {"Name": "Friend R.H.", "AuthorID": "8077782000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "14421269400": {"Name": "Frost J.M.", "AuthorID": "14421269400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "57195351899": {"Name": "Rapidis A.G.", "AuthorID": "57195351899", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57216793729": {"Name": "McCulloch I.", "AuthorID": "57216793729", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SPERC, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology"}}}
