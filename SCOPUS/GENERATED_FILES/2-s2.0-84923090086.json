The 30 most frequent monolexemic colour terms were analyzed with regards to frequency, consensus among genders, response times, consistency of use, denotative volume in the Munsell and OSA colour spaces and inter-experimental agreement. Each of these measures served for ranking colour term salience; rankings were then combined to give a composite index of basicness. The results support the extension of English inventory from the 11 basic colour terms of Berlin and Kay to 13 terms by the addition of lilac and turquoise.", "AuthorKeywords": ["basic colour terms", "basicness", "colour categorization", "colour naming", "lilac", "online experiment", "turquoise", "web colour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Basic colour terms", "Basicness", "Lilac", "On-line experiments", "Turquoise"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923090086", "SubjectAreas": [["Human Factors and Ergonomics", "SOCI", "3307"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"36667144700": {"Name": "Mylonas D.", "AuthorID": "36667144700", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University"}, "7103387453": {"Name": "MacDonald L.", "AuthorID": "7103387453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
