The most common animal model to investigate bladder remodeling in pBOO are female rodents undergoing partial obstruction at the proximal urethra. Variability in the degree of obstruction and animal mortality are major concerns with proximal obstruction. Furthermore, dissecting around the proximal urethra and bladder neck jeopardizes bladder innervation. We developed a nerve-sparing mid-urethral obstruction (NeMO) model for pBOO avoiding the disadvantages of the traditional model. We approached the urethra just inferior to the pubic symphysis, which obviated the need for laparotomy as well as for dissection in this area; also, the striated urethral sphincter remained untouched. We performed NeMO in female Sprague-Dawley rats (12 obstructions, 6 sham animals) as well as in female C57/bl6 mice (20 obstructions, 18 sham animals). After two weeks, we evaluated bladder function, bladder mass, and body mass. We had no mortalities among obstructed- or sham-operated female rats; as described for the traditional proximal pBOO-method, we tied the suture around the proximal urethra and a temporarily placed 0.9 mm metal rod. NeMO induced an 85% increase in bladder mass after two weeks, average residual urine volume was 0.4 mL in partially obstructed rats while only 0.03 mL in sham animals. In mice, we tested 3 sizes of cannulas that we placed along the urethra when tying the suture. We found that using a 27-gauge cannula resulted in over 50% animal mortality; placing the 25-gauge cannula did not yield the desired response in increasing bladder mass; utilizing a 26-gauge cannula yielded favorable results with minimal animal mortality (1/8) yet a significant 2-fold increase in bladder mass.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animal model", "Bladder hypertrophy", "Bladder remodeling", "Issue 122", "Medicine", "Mid-urethral obstruction", "Neurogenic bladder", "Partial bladder outlet obstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Urethra", "Urethral Obstruction", "Urinary Bladder", "Urinary Bladder Neck Obstruction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032334514", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57188730952": {"Name": "Sidler M.", "AuthorID": "57188730952", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Urology, The Hospital for Sick Children"}, "35596755500": {"Name": "Aitken K.", "AuthorID": "35596755500", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children"}, "7003926713": {"Name": "B\u00e4gli D.", "AuthorID": "7003926713", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Urology, The Hospital for Sick Children"}, "55649161600": {"Name": "Jiang J.", "AuthorID": "55649161600", "AffiliationID": "60030319", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Structure and Function, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children"}}}
