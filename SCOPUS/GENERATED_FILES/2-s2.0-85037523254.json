The presence of a pore fluid within the pore space in reservoir rocks has been shown to exert a significant influence on rock deformation, in particular through stress corrosion and subcritical crack growth. Under triaxial stress conditions, stress corrosion leads to highly non-linear timedependent deformation. This allows rocks to deform and fail over extended periods of time. Existing experimental data were however all obtained in the brittle regime. In this study, we systematically investigated time-dependent compaction in porous sandstone at high effective pressure. Our new creep data show that significant time-dependent deformation was observed at all tested conditions beyond the yield point. In all cases, the deformation was compactant. The three damage proxies recorded during our experiments showed an obvious correlation, suggesting that the mechanism leading to this time-dependent compaction is stress corrosion cracking. Visual inspection of samples deformed over periods of time between a few hours and a few days, revealed the presence of discrete compaction bands. Our data therefore suggest that compaction bands could develop at stresses significantly lower than reported in previous studies and hence closer to estimates based on field observations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Effective pressure", "Field observations", "Reservoir compaction", "Strain localisation", "Subcritical crack growth", "Time-dependent deformation", "Triaxial stress condition", "Visual inspection"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037523254", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"]], "AuthorData": {"7003489676": {"Name": "Baud P.", "AuthorID": "7003489676", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "University of Strasbourg (EOST)"}, "15753312300": {"Name": "Heap M.", "AuthorID": "15753312300", "AffiliationID": "60103368", "AffiliationName": "University of Strasbourg (EOST)"}, "25924737100": {"Name": "Brantut N.", "AuthorID": "25924737100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7102997852": {"Name": "Meredith P.", "AuthorID": "7102997852", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
