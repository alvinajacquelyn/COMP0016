It emerges from an informal review of our own institution's marketing, coordination and monitoring of sustainable cities-relevant programmes and a systematic review of similar programmes offered globally. This we present as a critical provocation responding to a key pedagogical challenge of sustainable cities education, that of promoting mobile knowledge and/or situated learning. We conclude by offering three possibilities for how higher education programme developers might embrace and operationalise this creative tension.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Higher education", "Knowledge", "Planning", "Policy mobility", "Sustainable city"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927909631", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"57213755359": {"Name": "Moore S.", "AuthorID": "57213755359", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "6701374209": {"Name": "Rydin Y.", "AuthorID": "6701374209", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}, "56306460000": {"Name": "Garcia B.", "AuthorID": "56306460000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Planning, University College London"}}}
