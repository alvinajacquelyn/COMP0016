We assess coronal plane kinematics of the GMK sphere and explore the occurrence and pattern of articular separation during static and dynamic activities. Methods Using pulsed fluoroscopy and image matching, the coronal kinematics and articular surface separation of 16 well-functioning TKAs were studied during weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing, static, and dynamic activities. The closest distances between the modelled articular surfaces were examined with respect to knee position, and proportions of joint poses exhibiting separation were computed. Results overall, 1717 joint poses were analyzed. At a 1.0 mm detection threshold, 37 instances of surface separation were observed in the lateral compartment and four medially (p < 0.001). separation was activity-dependent, both laterally and medially (p < 0.001), occurring more commonly during static deep flexion in the lateral compartment, and during static rotation in the medial compartment. Lateral separation occurred more frequently than medial during kneeling (7/14 lateral vs 1/14 medial; p = 0.031) and stepping (20/1022 lateral vs 0/1022 medial; p < 0.001). separation varied significantly between individuals during dynamic activities. Conclusion no consistent association between closest distances of the articular surfaces and knee position was found during any activity. Lift-off was infrequent and depended on the activity performed and the individual knee. Lateral separation was consistent with the design rationale. Medial lift-off was rare and mostly in non-weight-bearing activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronal stability", "Knee fluoroscopy", "Knee kinematics", "Total knee arthroplasty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066762541", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"57209176841": {"Name": "Key S.", "AuthorID": "57209176841", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre"}, "7402930299": {"Name": "Scott G.", "AuthorID": "7402930299", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre"}, "55241521700": {"Name": "Stammers J.G.", "AuthorID": "55241521700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre"}, "56692175600": {"Name": "Freeman M.A.R.", "AuthorID": "56692175600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre"}, "6603166883": {"Name": "Pinskerova V.", "AuthorID": "6603166883", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "First orthopaedic Clinic, Faculty of Medicine, Charles University"}, "8873915200": {"Name": "Field R.E.", "AuthorID": "8873915200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "South West london Elective orthopaedic Centre"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7201624607": {"Name": "Banks S.A.", "AuthorID": "7201624607", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical and aerospace Engineering, University of Florida"}}}
