Design: Prospective cohort design. Participants: There were 1958 children aged 7 to 12 years from the Taiwan 2009 National Health Interview Survey who were linked to the 2009 through 2013 claims data from the National Health Insurance system. Methods: Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the associations between 3 types of near visual activities in sedentary posture, namely reading (< 0.5, 0.5-0.9, \u22651.0 hours per day [h/d]), use of computer, Internet, and games (<0.5, 0.5-0.9, \u22651.0 h/d), and \u201ccram school\u201d attendance (<0.5, 0.5-1.9, \u22652.0 h/d), and incident myopia. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalent myopia was defined as those who had \u22652 ambulatory care claims (International Classification of Diseases code 367.1) in 2008-2009. Incident myopia was defined by those who had at least 2 ambulatory care claims (International Classification of Diseases code 367.1) during the 4-year follow-up period (2010-2013) after excluding prevalent cases. Results: Overall, 26.8% of children had myopia at baseline, and 27.7% of those without myopia at baseline developed incident myopia between 2010 and 2013. On average, they spent 0.68\u00b10.86 h/d on computer/Internet use, 0.63\u00b10.67 h/d on reading, and 2.78\u00b13.53 h/d on cram school. The results showed that children attending cram schools \u22652 h/d (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.68) had a higher risk of incident myopia. The effects of these activities remained similar in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Cram school attendance for \u22652 h/d may increase the risk of children's incident myopia. This effect may be due to increased near visual activity or reduced time outdoors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Child", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Leisure Activities", "Male", "Myopia", "Prevalence", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Taiwan", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048732683", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"15077845800": {"Name": "Ku P.", "AuthorID": "15077845800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "53874614300": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "53874614300", "AffiliationID": "60013720", "AffiliationName": "Department of Exercise Health Science, National Taiwan University of Sport"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55797654500": {"Name": "Lai Y.", "AuthorID": "55797654500", "AffiliationID": "60069716", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University"}, "7201734242": {"Name": "Chu D.", "AuthorID": "7201734242", "AffiliationID": "60104316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Care Management, National Taipei University of Nursing and Health Sciences"}, "22236100300": {"Name": "Yen Y.", "AuthorID": "22236100300", "AffiliationID": "60027502", "AffiliationName": "Section of Infectious Diseases, Taipei City Hospital, Taipei City Government"}, "37080847200": {"Name": "Hu H.", "AuthorID": "37080847200", "AffiliationID": "60069716", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, National Yang-Ming University"}, "37081266500": {"Name": "Liao Y.", "AuthorID": "37081266500", "AffiliationID": "60022637", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Promotion and Health Education, National Taiwan Normal University"}}}
