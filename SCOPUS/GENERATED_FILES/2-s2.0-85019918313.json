Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.i-Motifs are alternative DNA secondary structures formed in cytosine-rich sequences. Particular examples of these structures, traditionally assumed to be stable only at acidic pH, have been found to form under near-physiological conditions. To determine the potential impact of these structures on physiological processes, investigation of sequences with the capacity to fold under physiological conditions is required. Here we describe a systematic study of cytosine-rich DNA sequences, with varying numbers of consecutive cytosines, to gain insights into i-motif DNA sequence and structure stability. i-Motif formation was assessed using ultraviolet spectroscopy, circular dichroism and native gel electrophoresis. We found that increasing cytosine tract lengths resulted in increased thermal stability; sequences with at least five cytosines per tract folded into i-motif at room temperature and neutral pH. Using these results, we postulated a folding rule for i-motif formation, analogous to (but different from) that for G-quadruplexes. This indicated that thousands of cytosine-rich sequences in the human genome may fold into i-motif structures under physiological conditions. Many of these were found in locations where structure formation is likely to influence gene expression. Characterization of a selection of these identified i-motif forming sequences uncovered 17 genomic i-motif forming sequence examples which were stable at neutral pH.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Base Sequence", "Cytosine", "DNA", "Genome, Human", "Humans", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Telomere", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019918313", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"38362597600": {"Name": "Wright E.P.", "AuthorID": "38362597600", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia"}, "23974080500": {"Name": "Waller Z.A.E.", "AuthorID": "23974080500", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular and Structural Biochemistry, University of East Anglia"}, "8870592600": {"Name": "Huppert J.L.", "AuthorID": "8870592600", "AffiliationID": "60012901, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Intellectual Forum, Jesus College, University of Cambridge"}}}
