Non-human primates have long been considered to be the most appropriate animal to model lower limb dysfunction. More recently, however, there has been a wealth of scientific information gathered in the rat regarding the central control of locomotion. Moreover, rodent models of SCI at lumbar levels have been widely used to validate therapeutic scenarios aimed at the restoration of locomotor activities. Despite the growing use of the rat as a model of locomotor dysfunction, knowledge regarding the anatomical relationship between spinal cord motor neurons and the hindlimb muscles that they innervate is incomplete. Previous studies performed in our laboratory have shown the details of the muscle/motor neuron topographical relationship for the mouse forelimb and hindlimb as well as for the rat forelimb. The present analysis aims to characterize the segmental distribution of the motor neuron pools that innervate the muscles of the rat hindlimb, hence completing this series of studies. The location of the motor end plate (MEP) regions on the main muscles of the rat hindlimb was first revealed with acetylcholinesterase histochemistry. For each muscle under scrutiny, injections of Fluoro-Gold were then performed along the length of the MEP region. Targeting the MEPs gave rise to columns of motor neurons that span more spinal cord segments than previously reported. The importance of this study is discussed in terms of its application to gene therapy for SCI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hindlimb", "Motor end plates", "Motor neuron columns", "Motor neurons", "Rat", "Tract-tracing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcholinesterase", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Hindlimb", "Motor Endplate", "Motor Neurons", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Rats", "Rats, Long-Evans", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Stilbamidines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941101763", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56613639500": {"Name": "Mohan R.", "AuthorID": "56613639500", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroscience Facility, School of Medical Sciences, The University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia"}, "54404094400": {"Name": "Tosolini A.", "AuthorID": "54404094400", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroscience Facility, School of Medical Sciences, The University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia"}, "7404056992": {"Name": "Morris R.", "AuthorID": "7404056992", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Translational Neuroscience Facility, School of Medical Sciences, The University of New South Wales (UNSW) Australia"}}}
