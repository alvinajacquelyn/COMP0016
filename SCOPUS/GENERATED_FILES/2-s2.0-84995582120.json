The use of autologous somatic stem cells for repair of defects could improve quality and outcomes of such operations. The present study explored the ability of paediatric adipose-derived stem cells (pADSCs), a readily available source of autologous stem cells, to generate a cartilage construct with a functional epithelium. Paediatric ADSCs seeded on the biodegradable nanocomposite polymer, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane poly(\u03f5-caprolactone-urea) urethane (POSS-PCL), proliferated and differentiated towards mesenchymal lineages. The ADSCs infiltrated three-dimensional POSS-PCL nanoscaffold and chondroid matrix was observed throughout chondrogenically induced samples. In ovo chorioallantoic membrane-grafted ADSC-nanoscaffold composites were enwrapped by host vessels indicating good compatibility in an in vivo system. Furthermore, pADSCs could be induced to transdifferentiate towards barrier-forming epithelial-like cells. By combining differentiation protocols, it was possible to generate epithelial cell lined chondrogenic micromasses from the same pADSC line. This proof-of-concept study appears to be the first to demonstrate that individual pADSC lines can differentiate towards two different germ lines and be successfully co-cultured. This has important implications for bioengineering of paediatric airways and further confirms the plastic nature of ADSCs.
