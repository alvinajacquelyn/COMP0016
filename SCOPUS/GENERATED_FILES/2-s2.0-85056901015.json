Most of these applications share two key limitations: a) the complexity of the sound fields that can be produced is limited by the physical size of the transducers; and b) no obstacles can be present between the transducers and the control point. We present SoundBender, a hybrid system that overcomes these limitations by combining the versatility of phased arrays of transducers (PATs) with the precision of acoustic metamaterials. In this paper, we explain our approach to design and implement such hybrid modulators (i.e. to create complex sound fields) and methods to manipulate the field dynamically (i.e. stretch, steer). We demonstrate our concept using self-bending beams enabling both levitation and tactile feedback around an obstacle and present example applications enabled by SoundBender.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acoustic manipulation", "Metamaterials", "Self-bending beams"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic controls", "Acoustic metamaterials", "Bending beam", "Complex sounds", "Control point", "Design and implements", "On-body interactions", "Tactile feedback"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056901015", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57195642585": {"Name": "Norasikin M.A.", "AuthorID": "57195642585", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57215517228": {"Name": "Plasencia D.M.", "AuthorID": "57215517228", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "7801639106": {"Name": "Polychronopoulos S.", "AuthorID": "7801639106", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "55960652900": {"Name": "Memoli G.", "AuthorID": "55960652900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57203111453": {"Name": "Tokuda Y.", "AuthorID": "57203111453", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "35389893300": {"Name": "Subramanian S.", "AuthorID": "35389893300", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
