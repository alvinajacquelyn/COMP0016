Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1386 adolescents aged 12-15 years from three different socioeconomic groups according to their area of residence (middle-class areas, resettlement colonies and urban slum colonies). Level of oral hygiene was examined clinically using the Simplified Oral Hygiene Index (OHI-S), and an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to measure key socio-demographic variables and psychosocial and health-related behaviours. Logistic regression analysis tested the association between area of residence and poor oral hygiene. Results Poor oral hygiene was observed in 50.2% of the adolescents. There was a socioeconomic gradient in poor oral hygiene, with higher prevalence observed at each level of deprivation. These differences were only partly explained, and the differences between adolescent groups remained statistically significant after adjusting for various demographic variables, standard of living, social capital, social support and health-affecting behaviours (OR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.30-2.76; and OR: 2.50, 95% CI: 1.60-3.92 for adolescents from resettlement colonies and urban slums, respectively, than middle-class adolescents). Conclusion Area of residence emerged as a strong socioeconomic predictor of prevalence of poor oral hygiene among Indian adolescents. Various material, psychosocial and behavioural factors did not fully explain the observed inequalities in poor oral hygiene among different adolescent groups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adolescents", "inequalities", "oral health promotion", "oral hygiene", "psychosocial determinants of oral health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Humans", "India", "Male", "Oral Hygiene", "Poverty Areas", "Social Determinants of Health", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Toothbrushing", "Urban Population"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954285177", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55270329300": {"Name": "Mathur M.R.", "AuthorID": "55270329300", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dental Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India"}, "55775117300": {"Name": "Parmar P.", "AuthorID": "55775117300", "AffiliationID": "60139048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dental Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India"}, "57204336866": {"Name": "Tsakos G.", "AuthorID": "57204336866", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.G.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8610765600": {"Name": "Millett C.J.", "AuthorID": "8610765600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}}}
