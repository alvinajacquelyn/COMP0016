Scenarios involving user behavior or those that rely on user mobility are examples where standard sensor networks may not be suitable, and MCS provides an interesting solution. However, including human participation in sensing tasks presents numerous and unique research challenges. In this paper, we analyze three of the most important: user participation, data sensing quality and user anonymity. We tackle the three as a whole, since all of them are strongly correlated. As a result, we present PaySense, a general framework that incentivizes user participation and provides a mechanism to validate the quality of collected data based on the users\u2019 reputation. All such features are performed in a privacy-preserving way by using the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. Rather than a theoretical one, our framework has been implemented, and it is ready to be deployed and complement any existing MCS system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bitcoin", "Cryptocurrencies", "Mobile crowd sensing", "Privacy", "Reputation systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bitcoin", "Mobile crowd sensing", "Privacy preserving", "Reputation systems", "Research challenges", "User anonymity", "User behaviors", "User participation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970959890", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57184364400": {"Name": "Delgado-Segura S.", "AuthorID": "57184364400", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament d\u2019Enginyeria de la Informaci\u00f3 i les Comunicacions, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "55892450300": {"Name": "Tanas C.", "AuthorID": "55892450300", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament d\u2019Enginyeria de la Informaci\u00f3 i les Comunicacions, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "6507717344": {"Name": "Herrera-Joancomart\u00ed J.", "AuthorID": "6507717344", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament d\u2019Enginyeria de la Informaci\u00f3 i les Comunicacions, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}}}
