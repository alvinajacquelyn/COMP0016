Ten per cent of the human genome is thought to encode a zinc binding protein and its uses encompass catalysis, structural stability, gene expression and immunity. At present, there is no specific resource devoted to identifying and presenting all currently known zinc binding sites. Here we present ZincBind, a database of zinc binding sites and its web front-end. Using the structural data in the Protein Data Bank, ZincBind identifies every instance of zinc binding to a protein, identifies its binding site and clusters sites based on 90% sequence identity. There are currently 24 992 binding sites, clustered into 7489 unique sites. The data are available over the web where they can be browsed and downloaded, and via a REST API. ZincBind is regularly updated and will continue to be updated with new data and features.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Computational Biology", "Databases, Protein", "Models, Molecular", "Proteins", "Sequence Analysis, Protein", "User-Computer Interface", "Zinc"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061156281", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193588135": {"Name": "Ireland S.M.", "AuthorID": "57193588135", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "55708401700": {"Name": "Martin A.C.R.", "AuthorID": "55708401700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
