All rights reserved.We discuss the origin of multiscaling in financial time-series and investigate how to best quantify it. Our methodology consists in separating the different sources of measured multifractality by analyzing the multi/uni-scaling behavior of synthetic time-series with known properties. We use the results from the synthetic time-series to interpret the measure of multifractality of real log-returns time-series. The main finding is that the aggregation horizon of the returns can introduce a strong bias effect on the measure of multifractality. This effect can become especially important when returns distributions have power law tails with exponents in the range (2, 5). We discuss the right aggregation horizon to mitigate this bias.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autocorrelation", "Central limit theorem", "Multifractality", "Multiscaling", "Power law tails"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bias effects", "Central Limit Theorem", "Financial time series", "Multifractality", "Multiscaling", "Power-law tail", "Returns distribution", "Synthetic-time"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977900514", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55623183500": {"Name": "Buonocore R.J.", "AuthorID": "55623183500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, King's College London"}, "57203814738": {"Name": "Di Matteo T.", "AuthorID": "57203814738", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003460450": {"Name": "Aste T.", "AuthorID": "7003460450", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}}}
