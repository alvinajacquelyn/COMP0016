This paper analyses three cases based on interview data collected from Shanghai, Guizhou, and Henan between 2009 and 2012. Each case consists of an informal local resolution to one of the three farmland dilemmas, and involves a variety of actors\u2014local entrepreneurs, ethnic minority farmers, and village committee members\u2014who act as \u2018barefoot planners\u2019. On the basis of these findings, this paper makes a series of policy recommendations and calls for more flexible, spontaneous, and place-based farmland planning in China through social learning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "farmland", "informal planning", "social learning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947260538", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55894601800": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55894601800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}}}
