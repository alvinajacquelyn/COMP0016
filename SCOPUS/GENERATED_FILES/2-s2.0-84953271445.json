This review is based on the results from archaeozoological (including bone collagen carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analyses) and archaeobotanical analyses available from seven sites, dated to distinct time periods ranging from the Neolithic to the Middle Byzantine period. The data (both published and unpublished) are compiled with information available on settlement development and dynamics, in the study area. Results show changing agrarian and animal husbandry practices for a period of more than 8000 years, ranging between self-sustaining economies to specialised husbandry practices and an intensive agricultural exploitation of the landscape, in relation to human settlement activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioarchaeology", "Burdur", "Diachronic perspective", "Settlement development", "Subsistence", "Turkey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953271445", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"6506604649": {"Name": "De Cupere B.", "AuthorID": "6506604649", "AffiliationID": "60068588", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences"}, "36637697200": {"Name": "Kaptijn E.", "AuthorID": "36637697200", "AffiliationID": "60068588", "AffiliationName": "Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences"}, "35893851300": {"Name": "Marinova E.", "AuthorID": "35893851300", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Archaeological Science, University of Leuven"}, "55886485300": {"Name": "Van Neer W.", "AuthorID": "55886485300", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Leuven"}, "35787837200": {"Name": "Fr\u00e9mondeau D.", "AuthorID": "35787837200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Archaeological Science, University of Leuven"}, "7801486656": {"Name": "Poblome J.", "AuthorID": "7801486656", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Sagalassos Archaeological Research Project, University of Leuven"}, "55782474100": {"Name": "Vandam R.", "AuthorID": "55782474100", "AffiliationID": "60032083", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, State University of New York at Buffalo"}}}
