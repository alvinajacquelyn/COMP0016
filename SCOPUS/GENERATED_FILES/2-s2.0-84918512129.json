UNC-60A has higher activity to cause net depolymerization, and to inhibit polymerization, than UNC-60B. UNC-60B, on the other hand, shows much stronger severing activity than UNC-60A. To understand the structural basis of their functional differences, we have determined the solution structures of UNC-60A and UNC-60B proteins and characterized their backbone dynamics. Both UNC-60A and UNC-60B show a conserved ADF/cofilin fold. The G-actin (globular actin)-binding regions of the two proteins are structurally and dynamically conserved. Accordingly, UNC-60A and UNC-60B individually bind to rabbit muscle ADP-G-actin with high affinities, with Kd values of 32.25 nM and 8.62 nM respectively. The primary differences between these strong and weak severing proteins were observed in the orientation and dynamics of the F-actin (filamentous actin)-binding loop (F-loop). In the strong severing activity isoform UNC-60B, the orientation of the F-loop was towards the recently identified F-loop-binding region on F-actin, and the F-loop was relatively more flexible with 14 residues showing motions on a nanosecond-picosecond timescale. In contrast, in the weak severing protein isoform UNC-60A, the orientation of the F-loop was away from the F-loop-binding region and inclined towards its own C-terminal and strand \u03b26. It was also relatively less flexible with only five residues showing motions on a nanosecond-picosecond timescale. These differences in structure and dynamics seem to directly correlate with the differential F-actin site-binding and severing properties of UNC-60A and UNC-60B, and other related ADF/cofilin proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actin-depolymerizing factor (adf)/cofilin", "Filamentous actin (f-actin)", "Globular actin (g-actin)", "Isothermal titration calorimetry (itc)", "NMR", "Protein dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actin Depolymerizing Factors", "Actins", "Amino Acids", "Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Destrin", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Microfilament Proteins", "Nitrogen Isotopes", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Rabbits", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Solutions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918512129", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56397709600": {"Name": "Shukla V.K.", "AuthorID": "56397709600", "AffiliationID": "60030536", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute"}, "56443981700": {"Name": "Kabra A.", "AuthorID": "56443981700", "AffiliationID": "60030536", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute"}, "56448521800": {"Name": "Maheshwari D.", "AuthorID": "56448521800", "AffiliationID": "60030536", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute"}, "7201811468": {"Name": "Yadav R.", "AuthorID": "7201811468", "AffiliationID": "60030536", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute"}, "16506747200": {"Name": "Jain A.", "AuthorID": "16506747200", "AffiliationID": "60030536", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute"}, "36915462700": {"Name": "Tripathi S.", "AuthorID": "36915462700", "AffiliationID": "60030536", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute"}, "35338857000": {"Name": "Arora A.", "AuthorID": "35338857000", "AffiliationID": "60030536", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute"}, "35518924000": {"Name": "Ono S.", "AuthorID": "35518924000", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Emory University"}, "57202477914": {"Name": "Kumar D.", "AuthorID": "57202477914", "AffiliationID": "60025015", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Biomedical Research (CBMR), Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences Campus"}}}
