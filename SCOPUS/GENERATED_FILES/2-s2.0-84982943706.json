The results estimate the breadth of T cell responses for the first time in the context of an infection and human population setting. We determined the epitope repertoire of eleven representative Mtb antigens and a large panel of previously defined Mtb epitopes. We estimated that our analytic methods detected 50\u201375% of the total response in a cohort of 63 individuals. As expected, responses were highly heterogeneous, with responses to a total of 125 epitopes detected. The 66 top epitopes provided 80% coverage of the responses identified in our study. Using a panel of 48 HLA class II-transfected antigen-presenting cells, we determined HLA class II restrictions for 278 epitope/donor recognition events (36% of the total). The majority of epitopes were restricted by multiple HLA alleles, and 380 different epitope/HLA combinations comprised less than 30% of the estimated Mtb-specific response. Our results underline the complexity of human T cell responses at a population level. Efforts to capture and characterize this broad and highly HLA promiscuous Mtb-specific T cell epitope repertoire will require significant peptide multiplexing efforts. We show that a comprehensive \u201cmegapool\u201d of Mtb peptides captured a large fraction of the Mtb-specific T cells and can be used to characterize this response.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antigens, Bacterial", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Enzyme-Linked Immunospot Assay", "Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte", "Female", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Male", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "South Africa", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982943706", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"35849123900": {"Name": "Lindestam Arlehamn C.", "AuthorID": "35849123900", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, Department of Vaccine Discovery"}, "7006241185": {"Name": "McKinney D.", "AuthorID": "7006241185", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, Department of Vaccine Discovery"}, "56785176900": {"Name": "Carpenter C.", "AuthorID": "56785176900", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, Department of Vaccine Discovery"}, "34973214600": {"Name": "Paul S.", "AuthorID": "34973214600", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, Department of Vaccine Discovery"}, "8561294600": {"Name": "Peters B.", "AuthorID": "8561294600", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, Department of Vaccine Discovery"}, "35418504700": {"Name": "Sette A.", "AuthorID": "35418504700", "AffiliationID": "60014683", "AffiliationName": "La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, Department of Vaccine Discovery"}, "35198870300": {"Name": "Rozot V.", "AuthorID": "35198870300", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "56786588200": {"Name": "Makgotlho E.", "AuthorID": "56786588200", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "57190747255": {"Name": "Gregg Y.", "AuthorID": "57190747255", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "35732737700": {"Name": "van Rooyen M.", "AuthorID": "35732737700", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "57204295879": {"Name": "Hatherill M.", "AuthorID": "57204295879", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "6603950018": {"Name": "Hanekom W.", "AuthorID": "6603950018", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "6506142685": {"Name": "Scriba T.", "AuthorID": "6506142685", "AffiliationID": "60095279, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, Division of Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Cape Town"}, "7202651323": {"Name": "Ernst J.", "AuthorID": "7202651323", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, New York University School of Medicine"}}}
