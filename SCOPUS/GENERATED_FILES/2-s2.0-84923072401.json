Computational chemistry has significantly contributed to drug design and optimization in an extremely broad range of areas, including prediction of target druggability and drug likeness, de novo design, fragment screening, ligand docking, estimation of binding affinity, and modulation of ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties. Computationally driven drug discovery must continuously adapt to keep pace with the evolving knowledge of the factors that modulate the pharmacological action of drugs. There is thus an urgent need for novel computational approaches that integrate the vast amount of complex information currently available for small (bio)organic compounds, biologically relevant targets and their complexes, while also accounting accurately for the thermodynamics and kinetics of drug-target association, the intrinsic dynamical behavior of biomolecular systems, and the complexity of protein-protein networks. Understanding the mechanism of drug binding to and unbinding from biological targets is fundamental for optimizing lead compounds and designing novel biologically active ones. One major challenge is the accurate description of the conformational complexity prior to and upon formation of drug-target complexes. Recently, enhanced sampling methods, including metadynamics and related approaches, have been successfully applied to investigate complex mechanisms of drugs binding to flexible targets. Metadynamics is a family of enhanced sampling techniques aimed at enhancing the rare events and reconstructing the underlying free energy landscape as a function of a set of order parameters, usually referred to as collective variables. Studies of drug binding mechanisms have predicted the most probable association and dissociation pathways and the related binding free energy profile. In addition, the availability of an efficient open-source implementation, running on cost-effective GPU (i.e., graphical processor unit) architectures, has considerably decreased the learning curve and the computational costs of the methods, and increased their adoption by the community. Here, we review the recent contributions of metadynamics and other enhanced sampling methods to the field of drug-target recognition and binding. We discuss how metadynamics has been used to search for transition states, to predict binding and unbinding paths, to treat conformational flexibility, and to compute free energy profiles. We highlight the importance of such predictions in drug discovery. Major challenges in the field and possible solutions will finally be discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Computational Biology", "Drug Discovery", "Humans", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923072401", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"7101898098": {"Name": "Cavalli A.", "AuthorID": "7101898098", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "CompuNet, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "6507741513": {"Name": "Spitaleri A.", "AuthorID": "6507741513", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "CompuNet, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "23978674400": {"Name": "Saladino G.", "AuthorID": "23978674400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6603509498": {"Name": "Gervasio F.", "AuthorID": "6603509498", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
