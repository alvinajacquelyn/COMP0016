Biotechnology Journal Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &Co. KGaA.Norcoclaurine synthases (NCS), catalyzing a Pictet\u2013Spengler reaction in plants as one of the first enzymes in the biosynthetic benzylisoquinoline pathway, are investigated for biocatalytic transformations. The library of NCS available is extended by two novel NCSs from Argemone mexicana (AmNCS1, AmNCS2) and one new NCS from Corydalis saxicola (CsNCS); furthermore, it is shown that the NCS from Papaver bracteatum (PbNCS) is a highly productive catalyst leading to the isoquinoline product with up to >99% e.e. Under certain conditions lyophilized whole Escherichia coli cells containing the various overexpressed NCS turned out to be suitable catalysts. The reaction using dopamine as substrate bears several challenges such as the spontaneous non-stereoselective background reaction and side reactions. The PbNCS enzyme is successfully immobilized on various carriers whereby EziG3 proved to be the best suited for biotransformations. Dopamine showed limited stability in solution resulting in the coating of the catalyst over time, which could be solved by the addition of ascorbic acid (e.g., 1 mg ml\u22121) as antioxidant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biocatalysis", "flow chemistry", "immobilization", "norcoclaurine synthase", "Pictet\u2013Spengler-reaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biocatalysis", "Escherichia coli cells", "Flow chemistry", "Isoquinolines", "Pictet-Spengler reactions", "Side reactions", "Stereo-selective", "Synthases", "Alkaloids", "Argemone", "Benzylisoquinolines", "Biosynthetic Pathways", "Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases", "Catalysis", "Corydalis", "Dopamine", "Enzymes, Immobilized", "Escherichia coli", "Gene Library", "Papaver"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037346476", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"55315864600": {"Name": "Lechner H.", "AuthorID": "55315864600", "AffiliationID": "60022457, 60112421", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Graz, NAWI Graz, BioTechMed Graz"}, "50062057800": {"Name": "Soriano P.", "AuthorID": "50062057800", "AffiliationID": "60022457, 60112421", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Graz, NAWI Graz, BioTechMed Graz"}, "57198890776": {"Name": "Poschner R.", "AuthorID": "57198890776", "AffiliationID": "60022457, 60112421", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Graz, NAWI Graz, BioTechMed Graz"}, "7003874431": {"Name": "Kroutil W.", "AuthorID": "7003874431", "AffiliationID": "60022457, 60112421", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry, University of Graz, NAWI Graz, BioTechMed Graz"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
