Here, we report that brief exposure to dynamic substrate strain (sufficient to rapidly stimulate cell division) influences the orientation of osteoblastic cell division. The initial proliferative response to strain involves canonical Wnt signaling and can be blocked by sclerostin. However, the strain-related orientation of cell division is independently influenced through the noncanonical Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway. Blockade of Rho-associated coiled kinase (ROCK), a component of the PCP pathway, prevents strain-related orientation of division in osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells. Heterozygous loop-tail mutation of the core PCP component van Gogh-like 2 (Vangl2) in mouse osteoblasts impairs the orientation of division in response to strain. Examination of bones from Vangl2 loop-tail heterozygous mice by mCT and scanning electron microscopy reveals altered bone architecture and disorganized bone-forming surfaces. Hence, in addition to the well-accepted role of PCP involvement in response to developmental cues during skeletal morphogenesis, our data reveal that this pathway also acts postnatally, in parallel with canonical Wnt signaling, to transduce biomechanical cues into skeletal adaptive responses. The simultaneous and independent actions of these two pathways appear to influence both the rate and orientation of osteoblast division, thus fine-tuning bone architecture to meet the structural demands of functional loading.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mechanical strain", "Osteoblasts", "Planar cell polarity", "VANGL2", "WNT signaling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Cell Polarity", "Cells, Cultured", "Mice", "Mutation", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Osteoblasts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922902132", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"37026041900": {"Name": "Galea G.", "AuthorID": "37026041900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "37004819100": {"Name": "Meakin L.", "AuthorID": "37004819100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "47961011500": {"Name": "Delisser P.", "AuthorID": "47961011500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "35597327700": {"Name": "Lanyon L.", "AuthorID": "35597327700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "24330069200": {"Name": "Price J.", "AuthorID": "24330069200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Veterinary Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "10539322200": {"Name": "Savery D.", "AuthorID": "10539322200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7006634311": {"Name": "Copp A.", "AuthorID": "7006634311", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "8699211500": {"Name": "Taipaleenmaki H.", "AuthorID": "8699211500", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Heisenberg-Group for Molecular Skeletal Biology, Department of Trauma, Hand and Reconstructive Surgery, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "57203080783": {"Name": "Stein G.", "AuthorID": "57203080783", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "University of Vermont"}, "16949544200": {"Name": "Van Wijnen A.", "AuthorID": "16949544200", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}}}
