Objective: To investigate whether single-subject gray matter network properties are related to impaired cognition in MS. Methods: We studied 148 MS patients (99 female) and 33 healthy controls (HC, 21 female). Seven network parameters were computed and compared within MS between cognitively normal and impaired subjects, and associated with performance on neuropsychological tests in six cognitive domains with regression models. Analyses were controlled for age, gender, whole-brain gray matter volumes, and education level. Results: Compared to MS subjects with normal cognition, MS subjects with cognitive impairment showed a more random network organization as indicated by lower lambda values (all p < 0.05). Worse average cognition and executive function were associated with lower lambda values. Impaired information processing speed, working memory, and attention were associated with lower clustering values. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that MS subjects with a more randomly organized gray matter network show worse cognitive functioning, suggesting that single-subject gray matter graphs may capture neurological dysfunction due to MS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognitive impairment", "magnetic resonance imaging", "multiple sclerosis", "Single-subject gray matter networks"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043351105", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"21741461600": {"Name": "Rimkus C.M.", "AuthorID": "21741461600", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "25958454400": {"Name": "Schoonheim M.M.", "AuthorID": "25958454400", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "57193553789": {"Name": "Eijlers A.J.C.", "AuthorID": "57193553789", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "55653016200": {"Name": "Steenwijk M.D.", "AuthorID": "55653016200", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "6506499076": {"Name": "Vrenken H.", "AuthorID": "6506499076", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "8302719300": {"Name": "Wattjes M.P.", "AuthorID": "8302719300", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "7004423164": {"Name": "Killestein J.", "AuthorID": "7004423164", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, VUmc MS Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}, "26643562500": {"Name": "Leite C.C.", "AuthorID": "26643562500", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, University College London"}, "57204782423": {"Name": "Tijms B.M.", "AuthorID": "57204782423", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}}}
