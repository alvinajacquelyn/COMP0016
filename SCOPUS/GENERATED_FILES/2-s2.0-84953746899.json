Introduction Manufacturing development and resources constraints are linked by a complex array of structural relationships which have been unfolding in a variety of ways in different countries since the Industrial Revolution. Resource constraints are sector specific and affect production tasks within each sector in more or less deep ways according to the production units involved and relative levels of aggregation at which economic systems are operating. This implies that, at each stage of structural change and according to the countries' different patterns of specialization, resources constraints (or abundance) will affect economic systems differently. Ultimately problems of resource scarcity tend also to acquire an international character and, as such, become a geopolitical and multi-polar issue, to the extent countries become integral parts of the increasingly modularized global manufacturing system. Within this complex and inherently dynamic architecture, interdependencies across sectoral value chains are the main channels through which resource constraints affect countries' manufacturing development trajectories. The aim of this chapter is to show firstly how multi-sectoral models of production in which resource constraints are structurally integrated offer critical analytical tools to unpack such complexity. In disentangling the relationships between manufacturing development and resource constraints, the chapter then focuses on the way in which the \u2018manufacturing apparatus\u2019 transforms the nature of scarcity by making it a \u2018relative\u2019 phenomenon functionally linked to incremental as well as disruptive technological changes. Building on an analytical-historical reconstruction of countries' structural learning trajectories, the chapter points out the inter-sectoral nature of \u2018technological scarcity\u2019 but also how scarcity-induced technological innovations may trigger cumulative technological transformations across sectors. An understanding of these resource-led structural dynamics provides fresh lenses to investigate the political economy of resource constraints at the national and international level. Going beyond the dominant \u2018resource curse\u2019 debate, the chapter concludes by sketching a number of specific policy implications. In particular, the lack of alignment of manufacturing, technology and resource policies (and, thus, the missed opportunity of creating and capturing value through resource-triggered complementarities over time) is identified as the main constraining factor for countries at both initial and more advanced stages of manufacturing development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953746899", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"55923039000": {"Name": "Andreoni A.", "AuthorID": "55923039000", "AffiliationID": "60103891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics at SOAS, University of London"}}}
