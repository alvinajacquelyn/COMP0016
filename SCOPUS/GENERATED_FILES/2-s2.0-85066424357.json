Thus there is a great need for adjunct and novel treatments for enhanced or alternative post-HI neuroprotection. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have recently been shown to exhibit regenerative effects in various injury models. Here we present findings showing neuroprotective effects of MSC-derived EVs in the Rice-Vannucci model of severe HI-induced neonatal brain insult. Methods: Mesenchymal stromal/stem cell-derived EVs were applied intranasally immediately post HI-insult and behavioral outcomes were observed 48 h following MSC-EV treatment, as assessed by negative geotaxis. Brains were thereafter excised and assessed for changes in glial responses, cell death, and neuronal loss as markers of damage at 48 h post HI-insult. Results: Brains of the MSC-EV treated group showed a significant decrease in microglial activation, cell death, and percentage tissue volume loss in multiple brain regions, compared to the control-treated groups. Furthermore, negative geotaxis test showed improved behavioral outcomes at 48 h following MSC-EV treatment. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the clinical potential of using MSC-derived EVs following neonatal hypoxia-ischaemia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Extracellular vesicles", "Hypoxia", "Ischaemia", "Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells", "Microglia", "Neuroprotection"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066424357", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57193005959": {"Name": "Sisa C.", "AuthorID": "57193005959", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "57209068674": {"Name": "Naylor J.", "AuthorID": "57209068674", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "22937760400": {"Name": "Hristova M.", "AuthorID": "22937760400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair Group, EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "36157976600": {"Name": "Kholia S.", "AuthorID": "36157976600", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "57192307768": {"Name": "Bruno S.", "AuthorID": "57192307768", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "7101926972": {"Name": "Camussi G.", "AuthorID": "7101926972", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, University of Turin"}, "56594148700": {"Name": "Sanchez M.B.H.", "AuthorID": "56594148700", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "2i3T Incubator and Technology Transfer, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin"}, "6603388376": {"Name": "Deregibus M.C.", "AuthorID": "6603388376", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "2i3T Incubator and Technology Transfer, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin"}, "6701580410": {"Name": "Inal J.M.", "AuthorID": "6701580410", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Extracellular Vesicle Research Unit, Bioscience Research Group, School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "7202237069": {"Name": "Lange S.", "AuthorID": "7202237069", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Architecture and Regeneration Research Group, School of Life Sciences, University of Westminster"}}}
