They generate epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which are known to have anti-inflammatory effects, but little is known about their role in macrophage function. By high-throughput sequencing of RNA in primary macrophages derived from rodents and humans, we establish the relative expression of epoxygenases in these cells. Zinc-finger nuclease-mediated targeted gene deletion of the major rat macrophage epoxygenase Cyp2j4 (ortholog of human CYP2J2) resulted in reduced epoxyeicosatrienoic acid synthesis. Cyp2j4<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages have relatively increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g levels and show a profibrotic transcriptome, displaying overexpression of a specific subset of genes (260 transcripts) primarily involved in extracellular matrix, with fibronectin being the most abundantly expressed transcript. Fibronectin expression is under the control of epoxygenase activity in human and rat primary macrophages. In keeping with the in vitro findings, Cyp2j4<sup>-/-</sup> rats show upregulation of type I collagen following unilateral ureter obstruction of the kidney, and quantitative proteomics analysis (liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry) showed increased renal type I collagen and fibronectin protein abundance resulting from experimentally induced crescentic glomerulonephritis in these rats. Taken together, these results identify the rat epoxygenase Cyp2j4 as a determinant of a profibrotic macrophage transcriptome that could have implications in various inflammatory conditions, depending on macrophage function.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System", "Disease Models, Animal", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Fibrosis", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "Glomerulonephritis", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Macrophages", "Male", "Rats", "Rats, Inbred WKY", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA Interference", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929094973", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"8313253500": {"Name": "Behmoaras J.", "AuthorID": "8313253500", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complement and Inflammation Research, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "56313137800": {"Name": "Ko J.H.", "AuthorID": "56313137800", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complement and Inflammation Research, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7202531743": {"Name": "Cook T.H.", "AuthorID": "7202531743", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Complement and Inflammation Research, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "26643597700": {"Name": "Aitman T.J.", "AuthorID": "26643597700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "56637659900": {"Name": "Diaz A.G.", "AuthorID": "56637659900", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Physiological Genomics and Medicine Group, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "25923180300": {"Name": "Venda L.", "AuthorID": "25923180300", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Physiological Genomics and Medicine Group, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "16234728100": {"Name": "Srivastava P.", "AuthorID": "16234728100", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore"}, "57191842541": {"Name": "Petretto E.", "AuthorID": "57191842541", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore"}, "48761835700": {"Name": "Montoya A.", "AuthorID": "48761835700", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Laboratory, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "26433290800": {"Name": "Faull P.", "AuthorID": "26433290800", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Biological Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Laboratory, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "23478435400": {"Name": "Webster Z.", "AuthorID": "23478435400", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Embryonic Stem Cell and Transgenics Facility, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "55363160900": {"Name": "Moyon B.", "AuthorID": "55363160900", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Embryonic Stem Cell and Transgenics Facility, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "7006620861": {"Name": "Pusey C.D.", "AuthorID": "7006620861", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Renal Section, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57203195982": {"Name": "Abraham D.J.", "AuthorID": "57203195982", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, University College London Medical School"}}}
