Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between bipolar voltage, CV dynamics, and AF drivers. Methods: Patients undergoing catheter ablation for persistent AF (<24 months) were enrolled. Unipolar electrograms were recorded with a 64-pole basket catheter during atrial pacing at 4 pacing intervals (PIs) during sinus rhythm. CVs were measured between pole pairs along the wavefront path and correlated with underlying bipolar voltage. CV dynamics within low-voltage zones (LVZs <0.5 mV) were compared to those of non-LVZs (\u22650.5 mV) and were correlated to driver sites mapped using CARTOFINDER (Biosense Webster). Results: Eighteen patients were included (age 62 \u00b1 10 years). Mean CV at 600 ms was 1.59 \u00b1 0.13 m/s in non-LVZs vs 0.98 \u00b1 0.23 m/s in LVZs (P <.001). CV decreased incrementally over all 4 PIs in LVZs, whereas in non-LVZs a substantial decrease in CV was only seen between PIs 300\u2013250 ms (0.59 \u00b1 0.09 m/s; P <.001). Rate-dependent CV slowing sites measurements, defined as exhibiting CV reduction \u226520% more than the mean CV reduction seen between PIs 600\u2013250 ms for that voltage zone, were predominantly in LVZs (0.2\u20130.5 mV; 75.6% \u00b1 15.5%; P <.001). Confirmed rotational drivers were mapped to these sites in 94.1% of cases (sensitivity 94.1%, 95% CI 71.3%\u201399.9%; specificity 77.9%, 95% CI 74.9%\u201380.7%). Conclusion: CV dynamics are determined largely by the extent of remodeling. Rate-dependent CV slowing sites are predominantly confined to LVZs (0.2\u20130.5 mV), and the resultant CV heterogeneity may promote driver formation in AF.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrial fibrillation", "Bipolar voltage", "Conduction velocity", "Drivers", "Structural remodeling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atrial Fibrillation", "Catheter Ablation", "Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac", "Female", "Heart Atria", "Heart Conduction System", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052976592", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"26659044200": {"Name": "Honarbakhsh S.", "AuthorID": "26659044200", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7201390233": {"Name": "Schilling R.J.", "AuthorID": "7201390233", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "15769947600": {"Name": "Providencia R.", "AuthorID": "15769947600", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57197743699": {"Name": "Keating E.", "AuthorID": "57197743699", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "34971090100": {"Name": "Finlay M.", "AuthorID": "34971090100", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6701816368": {"Name": "Sporton S.", "AuthorID": "6701816368", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "57200949630": {"Name": "Chow A.", "AuthorID": "57200949630", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "26643939700": {"Name": "Earley M.J.", "AuthorID": "26643939700", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "35078522400": {"Name": "Hunter R.J.", "AuthorID": "35078522400", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
