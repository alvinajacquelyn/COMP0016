PC-controlled pneumatic actuation is employed to produce innocuous or noxious mechanical stimulation of the skin. Stimulation patterns are synchronized with fMRI and other relevant physiological measurements like electroencephalographic activity and vital physiological parameters. The system allows adjustable regulation of stimulation parameters and provides consistent patterns of stimulation. A validation experiment demonstrates that the system safely and reliably identifies clusters of functional activity in brain regions involved in the processing of pain. This new device is inexpensive, portable, easy-to-assemble and customizable to suit different experimental requirements. It provides robust and consistent somatosensory stimulation, which is of crucial importance to investigating the mechanisms of pain and its strong connection with the sense of touch.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mechatronics", "Nervous system", "Nociception"], "IndexKeywords": ["Experimental requirements", "Functional activities", "Functional magnetic imaging", "Mechanical stimulation", "Nociception", "Physiological measurement", "Physiological parameters", "Stimulation parameters", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Models, Neurological", "Pain", "Robotics", "Touch"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957003817", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56315541000": {"Name": "Riillo F.", "AuthorID": "56315541000", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Tor Vergata"}, "56001517600": {"Name": "Bagnato C.", "AuthorID": "56001517600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine"}, "55345899400": {"Name": "Allievi A.G.", "AuthorID": "55345899400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine"}, "56001722300": {"Name": "Takagi A.", "AuthorID": "56001722300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine"}, "35186032100": {"Name": "Arichi T.", "AuthorID": "35186032100", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, King\u2019s College London, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "7004358183": {"Name": "Burdet E.", "AuthorID": "7004358183", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine"}, "6603939894": {"Name": "Saggio G.", "AuthorID": "6603939894", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Engineering, University of Tor Vergata"}, "57203193780": {"Name": "Fabrizi L.", "AuthorID": "57203193780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
