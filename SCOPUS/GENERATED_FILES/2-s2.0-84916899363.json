The amniotic membrane (AM) contains at least two stem cell types from different embryological origins: ectodermal amniotic epithelial stem cells, and mesodermal mesenchymal stromal cells. Among the second group we studied the characteristics of amniotic mesenchymal cells (AMC) versus the ones enriched for the commonly used surface marker c-Kit (amniotic progenitor/stem cells-ASC), a stem cell factor receptor with crucial functions in a variety of biological systems and presents in early progenitors of different origin, as been already demonstrated in the enriched chorionic stem cells.Methods After isolation, cells from the amniotic membranes (amniotic cells-AC) were selected for c-Kit (ASC) and compared these cells with c-Kit unselected (AMC), evaluating the expression of other stem cell markers (Oct-4, Tra-1-81, SSEA-4), CD271 and Slug.Results Immunofluorescence analysis showed that ASC cells exhibited greater stem cell marker expression and included more CD271 and Slug positive cells. This was consistent with the interpretation that c-Kit enriched AC show greater stemness capacity compared to c-Kit unselected AMC.Discussion AMC and ASC can both differentiate into various cell types including adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, neurogenic and hepatic lineages, but the enrichment in c-Kit improved stemness and differentiation potential of ASC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amniotic membrane", "c-Kit", "Human amniotic stem cells", "Oct-4", "Placenta", "Pluripotency markers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amnion", "Amnion", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Differentiation", "Epithelial Cells", "Epithelial Cells", "Female", "Female", "Humans", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Octamer Transcription Factor-3", "Octamer Transcription Factor-3", "Placenta", "Placenta", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit", "Stem Cells", "Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916899363", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"35238041900": {"Name": "Resca E.", "AuthorID": "35238041900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Science and Technology Park for Medicine, TPM, Democenter Foundation Mirandola"}, "8855541000": {"Name": "Zavatti M.", "AuthorID": "8855541000", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "6507881128": {"Name": "Maraldi T.", "AuthorID": "6507881128", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "7003588093": {"Name": "Bertoni L.", "AuthorID": "7003588093", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "6602234694": {"Name": "Beretti F.", "AuthorID": "6602234694", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "6701780342": {"Name": "De Pol A.", "AuthorID": "6701780342", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical, Medical, Dental and Morphological Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "27367924400": {"Name": "Guida M.", "AuthorID": "27367924400", "AffiliationID": "60082961", "AffiliationName": "EURAC Research, Center for Biomedicine"}, "7004683227": {"Name": "La Sala G.B.", "AuthorID": "7004683227", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Obstetrics and Gynecology Unit, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Pediatrics, Arcispedale Santa Maria Nuova"}, "17034676900": {"Name": "Guillot P.V.", "AuthorID": "17034676900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Prenatal Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Pathology, Camelia Botnar Laboratories, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "24801882300": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "24801882300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Surgery Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
