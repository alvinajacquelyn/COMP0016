All rights reserved.Introduction Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy are the two most common bariatric surgery performed in the UK that result in comparable weight loss and remission of obesity-associated comorbidities. However, there is a paucity of studies examining the impact of these procedures on body composition, physical activity levels, sedentary behaviour, physical function and strength, dietary intake, health-related quality of life and costs. Methods and analysis The BARI-LIFESTYLE observational study is a 1-year prospective, longitudinal cohort study within a real-world routine clinical care setting aiming to recruit 100 patients with severe obesity undergoing either primary Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy from two bariatric centres in London, UK. Participants will be followed up four times during the study period; presurgery baseline (T0) and at 3 (T1), 6 (T2) and 12 months (T3) postsurgery. In addition to the standard follow-up investigations, assessments including dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, bioelectric impedance analysis, 6 min walk test, sit-to-stand test and handgrip test will be undertaken together with completion of questionnaires. Physical activity levels and sedentary behaviour will be assessed using accelerometer, and dietary intake will be recorded using a 3-day food diary. Outcome measures will include body weight, body fat mass, lean muscle mass, bone mineral density, physical activity levels, sedentary behaviour, physical function and strength, dietary intake, health-related quality of life, remission of comorbidities, healthcare resource utilisation and costs. Ethics and dissemination This study has been reviewed and given a favourable ethical opinion by London-Dulwich Research Ethics Committee (17/LO/0950). The results will be presented to stakeholder groups locally, nationally and internationally and published in peer-reviewed medical journals. The lay-person summary of the findings will be published on the Centre for Obesity Research, University College London website (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/obesity).", "AuthorKeywords": ["bariatric surgery", "body composition", "diet", "obesity", "physical activity", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorptiometry, Photon", "Adult", "Aged", "Body Composition", "Body Weight", "Exercise", "Female", "Gastrectomy", "Gastric Bypass", "Humans", "Life Style", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Obesity, Morbid", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044242167", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56716424700": {"Name": "Jassil F.C.", "AuthorID": "56716424700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Bariatric Centre for Weight Management and Metabolic Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "57219385975": {"Name": "Carnemolla A.", "AuthorID": "57219385975", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals"}, "37102604700": {"Name": "Pucci A.", "AuthorID": "37102604700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Bariatric Centre for Weight Management and Metabolic Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "53867791200": {"Name": "Chaiyasoot K.", "AuthorID": "53867791200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Bariatric Centre for Weight Management and Metabolic Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "7004418512": {"Name": "Batterham R.L.", "AuthorID": "7004418512", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals"}, "56716289600": {"Name": "Kingett H.", "AuthorID": "56716289600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals"}, "56714729100": {"Name": "Doyle J.", "AuthorID": "56714729100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals"}, "57201289452": {"Name": "Kirk A.", "AuthorID": "57201289452", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre, National Institute of Health Research University College London Hospitals"}, "36604939600": {"Name": "Paton B.", "AuthorID": "36604939600", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport Exercise and Health"}, "52164155000": {"Name": "O'Keeffe A.G.", "AuthorID": "52164155000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "55975260100": {"Name": "Lewis N.", "AuthorID": "55975260100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
