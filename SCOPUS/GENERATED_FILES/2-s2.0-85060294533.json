Magnetic particles added in water-oil based compound droplet are used. The magnetic properties of particles and electrowetting forces are utilized to cause particle separation using magnetic and electric fields. This paper demonstrates magnetic particle concentration and separation in an open digital microfluidic platform using compound droplets. It provides a new paradigm to enhance liquid manipulation using compound droplets on lab-on-chip platforms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electro-wetting on dielectrics", "Electrowetting force", "Liquid manipulations", "Magnetic and electric fields", "Magnetic particle", "Microfluidic platforms", "Novel techniques", "Particle separation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060294533", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"56825133900": {"Name": "Bansal S.", "AuthorID": "56825133900", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Indian Institute of Science"}, "55432207900": {"Name": "Sen P.", "AuthorID": "55432207900", "AffiliationID": "60014097", "AffiliationName": "Indian Institute of Science"}}}
