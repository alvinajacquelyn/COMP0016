Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.The aim of this study was to assess the agreement between data on cerebral amyloidosis, derived using Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography and (i) multi-laboratory INNOTEST enzyme linked immunosorbent assay derived cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of amyloid-\u03b242; (ii) centrally measured cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242 using a Meso Scale Discovery enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; and (iii) cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-\u03b242 centrally measured using an antibody-independent mass spectrometry-based reference method. Moreover, we examined the hypothesis that discordance between amyloid biomarker measurements may be due to interindividual differences in total amyloid-\u03b2 production, by using the ratio of amyloid-\u03b242 to amyloid-\u03b240. Our study population consisted of 243 subjects from seven centres belonging to the Biomarkers for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease Initiative, and included subjects with normal cognition and patients with mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. All had Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography data, cerebrospinal fluid INNOTEST amyloid-\u03b242 values, and cerebrospinal fluid samples available for reanalysis. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were reanalysed (amyloid-\u03b242 and amyloid-\u03b240) using Meso Scale Discovery electrochemiluminescence enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technology, and a novel, antibody-independent, mass spectrometry reference method. Pittsburgh compound B standardized uptake value ratio results were scaled using the Centiloid method. Concordance between Meso Scale Discovery/mass spectrometry reference measurement procedure findings and Pittsburgh compound B was high in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, while more variable results were observed for cognitively normal and non-Alzheimer's disease groups. Agreement between Pittsburgh compound B classification and Meso Scale Discovery/mass spectrometry reference measurement procedure findings was further improved when using amyloid-\u03b242/40. Agreement between Pittsburgh compound B visual ratings and Centiloids was near complete. Despite improved agreement between Pittsburgh compound B and centrally analysed cerebrospinal fluid, a minority of subjects showed discordant findings. While future studies are needed, our results suggest that amyloid biomarker results may not be interchangeable in some individuals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Centiloids", "CSF A\u03b242", "CSF A\u03b242/40", "PiB PET"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Aniline Compounds", "Biomarkers", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Dementia", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Spectrometry", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Thiazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994910647", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"35484474600": {"Name": "Leuzy A.", "AuthorID": "35484474600", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology,Care Science,and Society, Centre for Alzheimer Research, Karolinska Institutet"}, "55552411700": {"Name": "Chiotis K.", "AuthorID": "55552411700", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurobiology,Care Science,and Society, Centre for Alzheimer Research, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7102413103": {"Name": "Nordberg A.", "AuthorID": "7102413103", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "7003306777": {"Name": "Hasselbalch S.", "AuthorID": "7003306777", "AffiliationID": "60006564, 60015199", "AffiliationName": "Danish Dementia Research Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet"}, "56425420700": {"Name": "Rinne J.", "AuthorID": "56425420700", "AffiliationID": "60006876, 60003717", "AffiliationName": "Turku PET Centre, University of Turku"}, "16549426200": {"Name": "Johansson J.", "AuthorID": "16549426200", "AffiliationID": "60006876, 60003717", "AffiliationName": "Turku PET Centre, University of Turku"}, "55307490700": {"Name": "De Mendon\u00e7a A.", "AuthorID": "55307490700", "AffiliationID": "60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon"}, "7201539859": {"Name": "Otto M.", "AuthorID": "7201539859", "AffiliationID": "60010819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ulm University Hospital"}, "56800965000": {"Name": "Anderl-Straub S.", "AuthorID": "56800965000", "AffiliationID": "60010819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ulm University Hospital"}, "6506165748": {"Name": "Von Arnim C.", "AuthorID": "6506165748", "AffiliationID": "60010819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ulm University Hospital"}, "6701565311": {"Name": "Lle\u00f3 A.", "AuthorID": "6701565311", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "56186408100": {"Name": "Blesa R.", "AuthorID": "56186408100", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "36171423000": {"Name": "Fortea J.", "AuthorID": "36171423000", "AffiliationID": "60085102", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED)"}, "6701423628": {"Name": "Castelo-Branco M.", "AuthorID": "6701423628", "AffiliationID": "60027659, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Life Sciences (IBILI), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra"}, "6603922366": {"Name": "Santana I.", "AuthorID": "6603922366", "AffiliationID": "60025703, 60020985", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience and Cell Biology (CNC), Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra"}, "8140150600": {"Name": "Beer A.", "AuthorID": "8140150600", "AffiliationID": "60010819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Ulm University Hospital"}, "6508170833": {"Name": "Herukka S.", "AuthorID": "6508170833", "AffiliationID": "60103673, 60024252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio University Hospital"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "36574061600": {"Name": "Pannee J.", "AuthorID": "36574061600", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL, Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, University of Gothenburg"}}}
