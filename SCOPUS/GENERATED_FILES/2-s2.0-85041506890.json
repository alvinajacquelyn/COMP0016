We critically evaluated GSSI randomised controlled trials for those aged 6\u201325 years. Our meta-analysis of outcomes emphasised internal validity, thus was restricted to trials that used the parent-report social responsiveness scale (SRS) or the social skills rating system (SSRS). Large positive effect sizes were found for the SRS total score, plus the social communication and restricted interests and repetitive behaviours subscales. The SSRS social skills subscale improved with moderate effect size. Moderator analysis of the SRS showed that GSSIs that include parent-groups, and are of greater duration or intensity, obtained larger effect sizes. We recommend future trials distinguish gains in children\u2019s social knowledge from social performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Social competence", "Social responsiveness scale", "Social skills"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Behavior Therapy", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Social Skills", "Socioenvironmental Therapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041506890", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57191861000": {"Name": "Wolstencroft J.", "AuthorID": "57191861000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57202799066": {"Name": "Srinivasan R.", "AuthorID": "57202799066", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57200531764": {"Name": "Kerry E.", "AuthorID": "57200531764", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004857206": {"Name": "Skuse D.", "AuthorID": "7004857206", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "57126744600": {"Name": "Robinson L.", "AuthorID": "57126744600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, King\u2019s College London"}, "9743239400": {"Name": "Mandy W.", "AuthorID": "9743239400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
