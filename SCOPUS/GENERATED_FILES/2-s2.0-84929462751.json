The three-dimensional radial maze, or \"radiolarian\" maze, consists of a central spherical core from which arms project in all directions. Mice learn to retrieve food from the ends of the arms without omitting any arms or re-visiting depleted ones. We show here that mice can learn both a standard working memory task, in which all arms are initially baited, and also a reference memory version in which only a subset are ever baited. Comparison with a two-dimensional analogue of the radiolarian maze, the hexagon maze, revealed equally good working-memory performance in both mazes if all the arms were initially baited, but reduced working and reference memory in the partially baited radiolarian maze. This suggests intact three-dimensional spatial representation in mice over short timescales but impairment of the formation and/or use of long-term spatial memory of the maze. We discuss potential mechanisms for how mice solve the three-dimensional task, and reasons for the impairment relative to its two-dimensional counterpart, concluding with some speculations about how mammals may represent three-dimensional space.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D", "Memory", "Mice", "Navigation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Memory, Short-Term", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Spatial Learning", "Spatial Memory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929462751", "SubjectAreas": [["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56647165800": {"Name": "Wilson J.J.", "AuthorID": "56647165800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56647816100": {"Name": "Harding E.", "AuthorID": "56647816100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56647757100": {"Name": "Fortier M.", "AuthorID": "56647757100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56647571100": {"Name": "James B.", "AuthorID": "56647571100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56648017300": {"Name": "Donnett M.", "AuthorID": "56648017300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56648122000": {"Name": "Kerslake A.", "AuthorID": "56648122000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56647797200": {"Name": "O'Leary A.", "AuthorID": "56647797200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "56647263100": {"Name": "Zhang N.", "AuthorID": "56647263100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "26643352100": {"Name": "Jeffery K.", "AuthorID": "26643352100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Research Department of Experimental Psychology, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
