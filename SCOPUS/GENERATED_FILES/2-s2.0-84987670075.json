Understanding the fundamental mechanism underlying existing empirical or semi-empirical relationships is important for better assessing their reliability. This paper presents a particle-scale study of the correlation between cyclic resistance ratio (CRR) and the shear wave velocity corrected for overburden stress {Vs1). The discrete-element method was used to simulate a series of undrained stress-controlled cyclic triaxial tests together with shear wave velocity (Vs) measurements. Discrete-element method modelling with various relative densities, confining pressures and micro-parameters was performed under various cyclic stress ratios (CSRs), and the onset of liquefaction was illustrated through both macroscopic and microscopic responses, for example, inferred excess pore-water pressure, mechanical coordination number and redundancy index. The inter-particle friction was identified as the key micro-parameter that governs the liquefaction resistance of granular soils. A micro-scale CRR-Vs1correlation considering two independent micro-parameters, inter-particle friction and particle shear modulus, was then obtained and further validated with the outcomes from three dynamic centrifuge model tests performed on silica sand no. 8. This study demonstrates that the CRR-Vs1correlation is particle specific, thus soil specific, and the particle mechanical properties should be included in the Vs1-based method for future liquefaction evaluation of granular soils.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Centrifuge modelling", "Discrete-element modelling", "Liquefaction", "Particle-scale behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Centrifuge modelling", "Discrete Element Modelling", "Dynamic centrifuge model tests", "Excess pore water pressure", "Liquefaction evaluation", "Liquefaction potentials", "Macroscopic and microscopic", "Particle scale"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987670075", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"55521761000": {"Name": "Xu X.M.", "AuthorID": "55521761000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "7101774195": {"Name": "Ling D.S.", "AuthorID": "7101774195", "AffiliationID": "60003970, 60001604, 60117979", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Soft Soils and Geoenvironmental Engineering, Ministry of Education, Department of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "10140849200": {"Name": "Chen Y.M.", "AuthorID": "10140849200", "AffiliationID": "60003970, 60001604, 60117979", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Soft Soils and Geoenvironmental Engineering, Ministry of Education, Department of Civil Engineering, Zhejiang University"}, "55487700300": {"Name": "Cheng Y.P.", "AuthorID": "55487700300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
