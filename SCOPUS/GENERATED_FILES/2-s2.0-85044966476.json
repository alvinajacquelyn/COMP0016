The formalism accurately models the reflection of photons at the tissue-external medium interface using Fresnel\u2019s equations. The formalism was used to develop a gradient descent-based image reconstruction technique. The proposed methods were implemented for 3D diffuse optical imaging. In computational studies, it was observed that the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) for the output images and the estimated absorption coefficients reduced by 38% and 84%, respectively, when the reflection boundary conditions were incorporated. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating boundary conditions that model the reflection of photons at the tissue-external medium interface.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption co-efficient", "Computational studies", "Diffuse optical imaging", "Image reconstruction techniques", "Photon propagation", "Radiative transport equation", "Reflection boundaries", "Root mean square errors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044966476", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"36238167200": {"Name": "Jha A.", "AuthorID": "36238167200", "AffiliationID": "60006263, 60010261", "AffiliationName": "Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis"}, "57193811708": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "57193811708", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7401536070": {"Name": "Wong D.", "AuthorID": "7401536070", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University"}, "8960894400": {"Name": "Rahmim A.", "AuthorID": "8960894400", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
