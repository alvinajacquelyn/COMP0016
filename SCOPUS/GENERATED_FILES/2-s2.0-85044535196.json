The composition and structural characteristics of the ECM are widely variable among different tissues, suiting diverse functional needs. In diseased tissues, particularly solid tumors, the ECM is complex and influences disease progression. Cancer and stromal cells can significantly influence the matrix composition and structure and thus the mechanical properties of the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we describe the interactions that give rise to the structural heterogeneity of the ECM and present the techniques that are widely employed to measure ECM properties and remodeling dynamics. Furthermore, we review the tools for measuring the distinct nature of cell\u2013ECM interactions within the TME.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Constituent proteins", "Disease progression", "Extracellular matrices", "Matrix composition", "Mechanical integrity", "Structural characteristics", "Structural heterogeneity", "Tumor microenvironment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044535196", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"21734853900": {"Name": "Malandrino A.", "AuthorID": "21734853900", "AffiliationID": "60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory"}, "36537636600": {"Name": "Mak M.", "AuthorID": "36537636600", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale Biomedical Engineering, Yale University"}, "26643635500": {"Name": "Kamm R.", "AuthorID": "26643635500", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Biological Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "24554512000": {"Name": "Moeendarbary E.", "AuthorID": "24554512000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
