Through an exploration of policy enactment in three countries\u2014Liberia, South Africa, and Brazil\u2014it traces remarkable progress in policy, programmes, and research. The analysis asks why, despite such achievements, there is little evidence that these policy enactments have succeeded in reducing violence. The case studies reveal disconnects in the ways violence is conceptualized and acted upon by policy actors, which inhibit effective action. The article concludes that more attention is needed to the \u2018middle level\u2019 space between national and local policy enactments, and to tackling\u2014at national, district, school and community levels\u2014the norms and inequalities at the heart of gender-based violence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brazil", "Gender", "Liberia", "Policy", "South Africa", "Violence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978140819", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"23012732800": {"Name": "Parkes J.", "AuthorID": "23012732800", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
