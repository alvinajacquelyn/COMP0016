Users interact with the application with dynamic hands/feet gestures in front of the camera. Several proof-of-concept prototypes with eleven dynamic gestures are developed based on the touch-less interaction. At last, a comparing user study evaluation is proposed to demonstrate the usability of the touch-less approach, as well as the impact on user's emotion, running on a wearable framework or Google Glass.", "AuthorKeywords": ["H.1.2 [User/Machine Systems]: Human factors -", "H.5.1 [Multimedia Information Systems]: Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities -"], "IndexKeywords": ["H.5.1 [multimedia information systems]: artificial , augmented , and virtual realities", "Interaction technology", "Proof of concept", "User study evaluation", "User/machine systems", "Vision based", "Wearable devices"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954482295", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "SIAT, Chinese Academy of Science"}, "8937503800": {"Name": "Feng S.", "AuthorID": "8937503800", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "SIAT, Chinese Academy of Science"}, "36518552500": {"Name": "Feng L.", "AuthorID": "36518552500", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "SIAT, Chinese Academy of Science"}, "56375326400": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "56375326400", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)"}}}
