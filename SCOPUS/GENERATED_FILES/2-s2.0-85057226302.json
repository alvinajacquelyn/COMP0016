The importance of empirical evidence bases to underpin the collection, analysis, interpretation and presentation of forensic trace materials is increasingly acknowledged. This paper presents two experimental studies designed to address the transfer and persistence of sediments on the soles of footwear in forensically relevant scenarios, by means of quartz grain surface texture analysis, a technique which has been demonstrated to be able to distinguish between samples of mixed provenance. It was identified that there is a consistent trend of transfer and persistence of sediments from hypothetical pre-, syn- and post-crime event locations across the sole of the shoe, with sediments from \u2018older\u2019 locations likely to be retained in small proportions. Furthermore, the arch of the shoe (the area of lowest foot pressure distribution) typically (but not exclusively) retained the highest proportion of grain types from previous locations including the crime scene. A lack of chronological layering of the retained sediments was observed indicating that techniques that can identify the components of mixed provenance samples are important for analysing footwear sediment samples. It was also identified that the type of footwear appeared to have an influence on what particles were retained, with high relief soles that incorporate recessed areas being more likely to retain sediments transferred from \u2018older\u2019 locations from the journey history. In addition, the inners of footwear were found to retain sediments from multiple locations from the journey history that are less susceptible to differential loss in comparison to the outer sole. These findings provide important data that can form the basis for the effective collection, analysis and interpretation of sediments recovered from both the outer soles and inners of footwear, building on the findings of previously published studies. These data offer insights that enable inferences to be made about mixed source sediments that are identified on footwear in casework, and provide the beginnings of an empirical basis for assessing the significance of such sediment particles for a specific forensic reconstruction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Environmental trace evidence", "Footwear", "Forensic reconstruction", "Persistence", "Quartz grain surface texture analysis", "Transfer"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057226302", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"57194780985": {"Name": "Morgan R.M.", "AuthorID": "57194780985", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for the Forensic Sciences"}, "56196281700": {"Name": "Scott K.R.", "AuthorID": "56196281700", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Sciences & Psychology, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "57204806060": {"Name": "Ainley J.", "AuthorID": "57204806060", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford Centre for the Environment"}, "7101661287": {"Name": "Bull P.A.", "AuthorID": "7101661287", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford Centre for the Environment"}}}
