This can lead to variability in the quality of treatment plans and the efficiency in which plans are produced, depending on the skills and experience of the operator and available planning time. Within the last few years, there has been significant progress in the research and development of intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning approaches with automation support, with most commercial manufacturers now offering some form of solution. There is a rapidly growing number of research articles published in the scientific literature on the topic. This paper critically reviews the body of publications up to April 2018. The review describes the different types of automation algorithms, including the advantages and current limitations. Also included is a discussion on the potential issues with routine clinical implementation of such software, and highlights areas for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Automation", "Humans", "Knowledge Bases", "Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted", "Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056924868", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55953819300": {"Name": "Hussein M.", "AuthorID": "55953819300", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Metrology for Medical Physics Centre, National Physical Laboratory"}, "7003510716": {"Name": "Heijmen B.J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003510716", "AffiliationID": "60110188", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medical Physics, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute"}, "54392160500": {"Name": "Verellen D.", "AuthorID": "54392160500", "AffiliationID": "101224641", "AffiliationName": "Radiotherapy Department, Iridium Kankernetwerk"}, "7005065727": {"Name": "Nisbet A.", "AuthorID": "7005065727", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Surrey"}}}
