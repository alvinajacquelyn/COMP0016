Here, we describe a role for Set2-dependent H3K36 methylation in facilitating DNA replication and the transcriptional responses to both replication stress and DNA damage through promoting MluI cell-cycle box (MCB) binding factor (MBF)-complex-dependent transcription in fission yeast. Set2 loss leads to reduced MBF-dependent ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) expression, reduced deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) synthesis, altered replication origin firing, and a checkpoint-dependent S-phase delay. Accordingly, prolonged S phase in the absence of Set2 is suppressed by increasing dNTP synthesis. Furthermore, H3K36 is di- and tri-methylated at these MBF gene promoters, and Set2 loss leads to reduced MBF binding and transcription in response to genotoxic stress. Together, these findings provide new insights into how H3K36 methylation facilitates DNA replication and promotes genotoxic stress responses in fission yeast.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA replication", "dNTP", "histone H3K36 methylation", "histone methylation", "MBF", "ribonucleotide reductase", "Schizosaccharomyces pombe", "Set2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "DNA Damage", "DNA Replication", "DNA, Fungal", "Down-Regulation", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Genes, Fungal", "Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase", "Mutation", "Nucleotides", "Replication Origin", "S Phase", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029374296", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"24822034500": {"Name": "Pai C.C.", "AuthorID": "24822034500", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, ORCRB"}, "53979660000": {"Name": "Deegan R.S.", "AuthorID": "53979660000", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, ORCRB"}, "6701756894": {"Name": "Folkes L.", "AuthorID": "6701756894", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, ORCRB"}, "7004586287": {"Name": "Humphrey T.C.", "AuthorID": "7004586287", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CRUK-MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford, ORCRB"}, "57194458126": {"Name": "Kishkevich A.", "AuthorID": "57194458126", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "7006222988": {"Name": "de Bruin R.A.M.", "AuthorID": "7006222988", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "15727815100": {"Name": "Keszthelyi A.", "AuthorID": "15727815100", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Centre, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "56157551400": {"Name": "Carr A.M.", "AuthorID": "56157551400", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317", "AffiliationName": "Genome Damage and Stability Centre, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex"}, "7003758046": {"Name": "Kearsey S.E.", "AuthorID": "7003758046", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}, "36338959300": {"Name": "De Le\u00f3n N.", "AuthorID": "36338959300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}, "52564294600": {"Name": "Soriano I.", "AuthorID": "52564294600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}}}
