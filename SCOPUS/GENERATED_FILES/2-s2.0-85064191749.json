The cause of this remains unknown but meningeal inflammation has been implicated, particularly lymphoid follicles, which are seen in secondary progressive (SP) but not primary progressive (PP) MS. Cortical and periventricular MTR gradients might, therefore, differ in PPMS and SPMS if these follicles are responsible. Objective: We assessed cortical and periventricular MTR gradients in PPMS, and compared gradients between people with PPMS and SPMS. Methods: Using an optimised processing pipeline, periventricular normal-appearing white matter and cortical grey-matter MTR gradients were compared between 51 healthy controls and 63 people with progressive MS (28 PPMS, 35 SPMS). Results: The periventricular gradient was significantly shallower in healthy controls (0.122 percentage units (pu)/band) compared to PPMS (0.952 pu/band, p < 0.0001) and SPMS (1.360 pu/band, p < 0.0001). The cortical gradient was also significantly shallower in healthy controls (\u22122.860 pu/band) compared to PPMS (\u22123.214 pu/band, p = 0.038) and SPMS (\u22123.328 pu/band, p = 0.016). Conclusion: Abnormal periventricular and cortical MTR gradients occur in both PPMS and SPMS, suggesting comparable underlying pathological processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["magnetisation transfer ratio", "normal-appearing white matter", "Primary progressive multiple sclerosis", "secondary progressive multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064191749", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56334822000": {"Name": "Brown J.W.L.", "AuthorID": "56334822000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge"}, "57208244610": {"Name": "Chowdhury A.", "AuthorID": "57208244610", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "35795206700": {"Name": "Eshaghi A.", "AuthorID": "35795206700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "12787588000": {"Name": "Samson R.S.", "AuthorID": "12787588000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "56126712800": {"Name": "van de Pavert S.H.P.", "AuthorID": "56126712800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148, 60176027", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square Multiple Sclerosis Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "55883085700": {"Name": "Kanber B.", "AuthorID": "55883085700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57193550334": {"Name": "Prados Carrasco F.", "AuthorID": "57193550334", "AffiliationID": "60002581", "AffiliationName": "eHealth Center, Universitat Oberta de Catalunya"}, "56198868700": {"Name": "Sudre C.H.", "AuthorID": "56198868700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "23493507300": {"Name": "Pardini M.", "AuthorID": "23493507300", "AffiliationID": "60107402, 60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa, and IRCCS AOU San Martino-IST"}, "6602501665": {"Name": "Wheeler-Kingshott C.G.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "7004057758": {"Name": "Chard D.T.", "AuthorID": "7004057758", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals (UCLH)"}}}
