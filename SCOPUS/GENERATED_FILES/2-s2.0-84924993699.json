Therefore, in SIOPWT2001, post-operative chemotherapy for BT-WT was intensified aiming to improve survival. Survival analysis of all unilateral BT-WT patients (SIOPWT2001) (n = 238), was compared with historical BT-WT controls (SIOP93-01) (n = 113). 351/4061 (8.6%) unilateral non-metastatic BT-WT patients (SIOP93-01/SIOPWT2001) were studied. Median age at diagnosis was 43 months (Inter Quartile Range (IQR) 24-68 months), stages: I (n = 140, 40%), II (n = 106, 30%), III (n = 105, 30%). BT-WTs were higher staged, showed greater volume decrease after pre-operative chemotherapy and were diagnosed at an older median age compared to other WT patients. Patient characteristics did not differ substantially between SIOP93-01 and SIOPWT2001. Univariate analysis showed a 5-year event-free survival (EFS) of 80% (95% confidence interval (CI): 75-86%) (SIOPWT2001) compared to 67% in SIOP93-01 (95% CI: 59-76%; p = 0.006) and overall survival (OS) of 88% (95% CI: 83-93%) (SIOPWT2001) compared to 84% (95% CI: 77-91%; p = 0.4) in SIOP93-01. 95% of relapses were distant metastases (SIOP93-01/SIOPWT2001). Treatment protocol, age at diagnosis, tumour stage (III versus I/II) and volume (at surgery), were prognostic variables for EFS (uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis). Independent prognosticators for OS were age at diagnosis, tumour stage and volume (at surgery). The most significant survival benefit of intensified treatment, was observed in Stage I (EFS 96% in SIOPWT2001 (OS 100%), 71% in SIOP93-01 (OS 90%)). BT-WT derived benefits from more intensive chemotherapy as reflected by a reduction in relapse risk. However, the benefit of the more intensive chemotherapy to improve OS was only observed in stage I BT-WTs, by adding doxorubicin.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blastemal-type", "SIOPWT2001", "Survival", "Wilms tumour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Male", "Neoplasm Staging", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Treatment Outcome", "Wilms Tumor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924993699", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"6602159710": {"Name": "Van Den Heuvel-Eibrink M.M.", "AuthorID": "6602159710", "AffiliationID": "100319223", "AffiliationName": "Dutch Childhood Oncology Group"}, "36194977700": {"Name": "Gooskens S.L.", "AuthorID": "36194977700", "AffiliationID": "114544822", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology, Princess M\u00e1xima Centre for Paediatric Oncology"}, "56266131400": {"Name": "Van Tinteren H.", "AuthorID": "56266131400", "AffiliationID": "60015205", "AffiliationName": "Biometrics Department, Netherlands Cancer Institute"}, "7102206707": {"Name": "Bergeron C.", "AuthorID": "7102206707", "AffiliationID": "60018084", "AffiliationName": "Centre L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard"}, "6602254537": {"Name": "Coulomb-L'Hermine A.", "AuthorID": "6602254537", "AffiliationID": "60013700", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Hospital d'Enfants Armand Trousseau"}, "7004176152": {"Name": "De Camargo B.", "AuthorID": "7004176152", "AffiliationID": "60014878", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Nacional Do Cancer, Pediatric Hematology Program"}, "7004511127": {"Name": "Leuschner I.", "AuthorID": "7004511127", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Kiel Pediatric Tumour Registry, University of Kiel"}, "7005154753": {"Name": "Sandstedt B.", "AuthorID": "7005154753", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska Institutet Stockholm"}, "6506533418": {"Name": "Acha T.", "AuthorID": "6506533418", "AffiliationID": "60004717", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Materno-Infantil carlos Haya"}, "6602192341": {"Name": "Godzinski J.", "AuthorID": "6602192341", "AffiliationID": "60007108, 60088020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Surgery, Marciniak Hospital Wroclaw and Department of Emergency Medicine, Medical University"}, "16679786700": {"Name": "Oldenburger F.", "AuthorID": "16679786700", "AffiliationID": "60070178, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Centre"}, "7005884835": {"Name": "De Kraker J.", "AuthorID": "7005884835", "AffiliationID": "60070178, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Oncology-Hematology, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Centre"}, "7005591155": {"Name": "Vujanic G.M.", "AuthorID": "7005591155", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, School of Medicine Cardiff University"}, "7005535741": {"Name": "Pritchard-Jones K.", "AuthorID": "7005535741", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "34975072100": {"Name": "Graf N.", "AuthorID": "34975072100", "AffiliationID": "60023686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital for Children"}}}
