E-DETECT TB, a European multi-county collaboration, aims to address the present lack of evidence on effectiveness of migrant TB screening by collating data in an international database and perform cross-country pooled and comparative analyses of screening coverage, results and linkage to care. Method: A database was established using migrant TB screening data from participating countries\u2019 national screening programs, national screening pilots and local research projects. All partner countries contributed to a common agreed protocol with standardized variables, pooling available numerator and denominator screening data from participating countries and sites. Results: All collaborating members drafted and agreed upon a data sharing accord as well as a protocol that clearly defined responsibilities and data governance principles. The database has been created and data transfer is ongoing. Conclusion: By persistence and focus the project has overcome considerable administrative, practical and legal challenges. This international collaboration provides greater power of analysis of harmonized data and thereby a unique opportunity to contribute migrant TB screening evidence. E-DETECT TB has started to invite other countries to contribute data to the database.", "AuthorKeywords": ["database", "international collaboration", "low-incidence countries", "migrants", "TB screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Databases, Factual", "Europe", "Humans", "Incidence", "Latent Tuberculosis", "Mass Screening", "Transients and Migrants", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062194393", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56592788300": {"Name": "\u00d6hd J.N.", "AuthorID": "56592788300", "AffiliationID": "60017615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communicable Disease Prevention and Control, Stockholm County Council, Smittskydd Stockholm"}, "6701569788": {"Name": "L\u00f6nnroth K.", "AuthorID": "6701569788", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Science, Karolinska Institutet"}, "16636677700": {"Name": "Hergens M.P.", "AuthorID": "16636677700", "AffiliationID": "60017615", "AffiliationName": "Department of Communicable Disease Prevention and Control, Stockholm County Council, Smittskydd Stockholm"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "6505927242": {"Name": "Zenner D.", "AuthorID": "6505927242", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "57209842885": {"Name": "Aldridge R.W.", "AuthorID": "57209842885", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Data Science, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "57205844896": {"Name": "Menezes D.", "AuthorID": "57205844896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Data Science, Institute of Health Informatics, University College London"}, "23984576100": {"Name": "Erkens C.", "AuthorID": "23984576100", "AffiliationID": "60024290", "AffiliationName": "KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation"}, "7102222973": {"Name": "Jonsson J.", "AuthorID": "7102222973", "AffiliationID": "60027479", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Agency"}, "56763914000": {"Name": "Marchese V.", "AuthorID": "56763914000", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, WHO Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV and TB Elimination, University of Brescia"}, "7006442223": {"Name": "Matteelli A.", "AuthorID": "7006442223", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, WHO Collaborating Centre for TB/HIV and TB Elimination, University of Brescia"}}}
