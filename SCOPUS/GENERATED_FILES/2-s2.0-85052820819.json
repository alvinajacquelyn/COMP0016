KGaA, WeinheimEngineering 2D-structured lead halide perovskites leads to both excellent optoelectronic performance and intriguing photophysics. Here, the underlying mechanisms of exciton interaction and carrier transfer in 2D/3D hybrid perovskites are studied. The investigated perovskites are in the form of self-assembled microplatelets, which are naturally composed of multiple perovskite phases, with n being 1, 2, 3, or 4 or nanocrystals in bulk phase (n \u2248 \u221e). Excitonic energy transfer and charge separation between different phases are found to coexist in this hybrid system, which occur at an ultrafast timescale (<100 fs) followed by a relatively slow channel (2\u201315 ps). The experimental results reveal that this hybrid perovskite naturally forms a series of \u201cheterostructures,\u201d with excitons generated in different phases, showing Coulomb interactions across the interface. This interlayer Coulomb coupling should account for the aforementioned ultrafast carrier transfer. This work provides an accurate and thorough explanation for the remarkable charge transfer rate, which is extremely beneficial for their applications in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices, even with the apparent interfacial scattering, defect trapping, and disorder-induced exciton localization in 2D/3D hybrid perovskites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["2D perovskites", "charge transfer", "energy funnel", "interlayer coupling", "tunneling effect"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge separations", "Charge-transfer rate", "Energy funnels", "Exciton interactions", "Exciton localization", "Inter-layer couplings", "Interfacial scattering", "Tunneling effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052820819", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57190745721": {"Name": "Wei K.", "AuthorID": "57190745721", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "35590198700": {"Name": "Jiang T.", "AuthorID": "35590198700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55598164400": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "55598164400", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57203750907": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "57203750907", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57203747260": {"Name": "Tang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203747260", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57193228861": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57193228861", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "36571054700": {"Name": "Zheng X.", "AuthorID": "36571054700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "7401753972": {"Name": "Cheng X.", "AuthorID": "7401753972", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "College of Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55792104600": {"Name": "You J.", "AuthorID": "55792104600", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Defense Technology Innovation, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "55788352600": {"Name": "Yin K.", "AuthorID": "55788352600", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Defense Technology Innovation, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "57221406260": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "57221406260", "AffiliationID": "60069719", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Defense Technology Innovation, Academy of Military Sciences PLA China"}, "56861486300": {"Name": "Chen R.", "AuthorID": "56861486300", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of High Performance Computing, College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56373566700": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "56373566700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Science and Technology on Advanced Ceramic Fibers and Composites Laboratory, College of Aerospace Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology"}, "55878871100": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55878871100", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Science and Technology on Advanced Ceramic Fibers and Composites Laboratory, College of Aerospace Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology"}}}
