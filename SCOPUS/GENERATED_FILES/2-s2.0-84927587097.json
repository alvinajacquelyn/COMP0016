However, the extent to which frailty is associated with the CVD risk profile has been little studied. Our aim was to examine the associations of a range of cardiovascular risk factors with frailty and to assess whether these are independent of established CVD. Methods Cross-sectional study of a socially representative sample of 1622 surviving men aged 71-92 examined in 2010 -2012 across 24 British towns, from a prospective study initiated in 1978-1980. Frailty was defined using the Fried phenotype, including weight loss, grip strength, exhaustion, slowness and low physical activity. Results Among 1622 men, 303 (19%) were frail and 876 (54%) were pre-frail. Compared with non-frail, those with frailty had a higher odds of obesity (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.99), high waist circumference (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.67 to 3.17), low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.54) and hypertension (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.54). Prevalence of these factors was also higher in those with frailty ( prevalence in frail vs non-frail groups was 46% vs 31% for high waist circumference, 20% vs 11% for low HDL and 78% vs 65% for hypertension). Frail individuals had a worse cardiovascular risk profile with an increased risk of high heart rate, poor lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)), raised white cell count (WCC), poor renal function (low estimated glomerular filtration rate), low alanine transaminase and low serum sodium. Some risk factors (HDL-C, hypertension, WCC, FEV1, renal function and albumin) were also associated with being pre-frail. These associations remained when men with prevalent CVD were excluded. Conclusions Frailty was associated with increased risk of a range of cardiovascular factors (including obesity, HDL-C, hypertension, heart rate, lung function, renal function) in older people; these associations were independent of established CVD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Frail Elderly", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Population Surveillance", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927587097", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"9743612700": {"Name": "Ramsay S.", "AuthorID": "9743612700", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "56515318000": {"Name": "Arianayagam D.", "AuthorID": "56515318000", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "56515153600": {"Name": "Cryer J.", "AuthorID": "56515153600", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "56592813200": {"Name": "Papacosta A.", "AuthorID": "56592813200", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}}}
