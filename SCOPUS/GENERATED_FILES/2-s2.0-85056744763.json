Objectives The aim of this study was to determine, for the first time, the expression of GLP-1R by colon nerve fibres in patients with IBD, and functional effects of its agonists in cultured rat and human sensory neurons. Methods GLP-1R and other nerve markers were studied by immunohistochemistry in colon biopsies from patients with IBD (n = 16) and controls (n = 8), human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissue, and in GLP-1R transfected HEK293 cells. The morphological effects of incretin hormones oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and glucagon were studied on neurite extension in cultured DRG neurons, and their functional effects on capsaicin and ATP signalling, using calcium imaging. Results Significantly increased numbers of colonic mucosal nerve fibres were observed in IBD biopsies expressing GLP-1R (p = 0.0013), the pan-neuronal marker PGP9.5 (p = 0.0008), and sensory neuropeptide CGRP (p = 0.0014). An increase of GLP-1R positive nerve fibres in IBD colon was confirmed with a different antibody to GLP-1R (p = 0.016). GLP-1R immunostaining was intensely positive in small and medium-sized neurons in human DRG, and in human and rat DRG cultured neurons. Co-localization of GLP-1R expression with neuronal markers in colon and DRG confirmed the neural expression of GLP-1R, and antibody specificity was confirmed in HEK293 cells transfected with the GLP-1R. Treatment with oxyntomodulin, exendin-4 and GLP-1 increased neurite length in cultured neurons compared with controls, but did not stimulate calcium influx directly, or affect capsaicin responses. However, exendin-4 significantly enhanced ATP responses in human DRG neurons. Conclusion Our results show that increased GLP-1R innervation in IBD bowel could mediate enhanced visceral afferent signalling, and provide a peripheral target for therapeutic intervention. The differential effect of GLP-1R agonists on capsaicin and ATP responses in neurons suggest they may not affect pain mechanisms mediated by the capsaicin receptor TRPV1, but may enhance the effects of purinergic agonists.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Cells, Cultured", "Colon", "Female", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "Middle Aged", "Nerve Fibers", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056744763", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6701372019": {"Name": "Anand U.", "AuthorID": "6701372019", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Nanomedicine Research Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7003464380": {"Name": "Yiangou Y.", "AuthorID": "7003464380", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Neuropathy Unit, Centre for Clinical Translation, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "8701787000": {"Name": "Akbar A.", "AuthorID": "8701787000", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Neuropathy Unit, Centre for Clinical Translation, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "56636855000": {"Name": "Quick T.", "AuthorID": "56636855000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6701402766": {"Name": "MacQuillan A.", "AuthorID": "6701402766", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24775715300": {"Name": "Fox M.", "AuthorID": "24775715300", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "16647168000": {"Name": "Sinisi M.", "AuthorID": "16647168000", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Nerve Injury Unit, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7003553167": {"Name": "Korchev Y.E.", "AuthorID": "7003553167", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Neuropathy Unit, Centre for Clinical Translation, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "35472567900": {"Name": "Anand P.", "AuthorID": "35472567900", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Peripheral Neuropathy Unit, Centre for Clinical Translation, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "55812337300": {"Name": "Jones B.", "AuthorID": "55812337300", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "53863087500": {"Name": "Bloom S.R.", "AuthorID": "53863087500", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital"}}}
