The experiment takes place in a prison camp located in the tropical forest. In this article, I examine the portrayal of power and embodiment in Rey Rosa\u2019s novella, placing the text in dialogue with thanatopolitical theory and outlining the ways it evokes the historical context of violence and economic transition in Guatemala. I commence by discussing the forms of power at work in the novella\u2019s prison camp, before examining the significance of medical science to Rey Rosa\u2019s depiction of embodiment. I then explore the complex aesthetic and ethical questions embedded in the relationship between language, textuality and the body in the novella. Finally, I discuss the post-human dimensions of the text that emerge in the relationship between the human bodies of the prisoners and the non-human terrain. Over the course of this analysis, I contend that Rey Rosa marshals the body to invoke the ways in which the category of the \u2018human\u2019 is formed, deconstructed and reconfigured in the face of the destructive power that operates in the modern techno-scientific epoch.", "AuthorKeywords": ["embodiment", "Guatemalan literature", "medical power-knowledge", "posthumanism", "Thanatopolitics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041100773", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"57194510433": {"Name": "Bollington L.", "AuthorID": "57194510433", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}}}
