We aimed to explore multiple aspects of action control, assessing reward-related behaviour, inhibition (externally and internally triggered) and sense of agency in PD patients, with and without ICB compared to healthy subjects. Methods Nineteen PD patients with ICB (PD-ICB), 19 PD without ICB (PD-no-ICB) and 19 healthy controls (HC) underwent a battery of tests including: Intentional Binding task which measures sense of agency; Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) measuring capacity for reactive inhibition; the Marble task, assessing intentional inhibition; Balloon Analog Risk Task for reward sensitivity. Results One-way ANOVA showed significant main effect of group for action binding (p = 0.004, F = 6.27). Post hoc analysis revealed that PD-ICB had significantly stronger action binding than HC (p = 0.004), and PD-no-ICB (p = 0.04). There was no difference between PD-no-ICB and HC. SSRT did not differ between PD groups, whereas a significant difference between PD-no-ICB and HC was detected (p = 0.01). No other differences were found among groups in the other tasks. Conclusions PD patients with ICB have abnormal performance on a psychophysical task assessing sense of agency, which might be related to a deficit in action representation at cognitive/experiential level. Yet, they have no deficit on tasks evaluating externally and internally triggered inhibitory control, or in reward-based decision-making. We conclude that impaired sense of agency may be a factor contributing to ICB in PD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action inhibition", "Impulse control disorders", "Impulsive-compulsive behaviours", "Parkinson's disease", "Reward", "Sense of agency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Compulsive Behavior", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Reaction Time", "Reward", "Volition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018976850", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36167347400": {"Name": "Ricciardi L.", "AuthorID": "36167347400", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular and Clinical Sciences, St George's University of London"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, UCL"}, "56397878100": {"Name": "de Boer L.", "AuthorID": "56397878100", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Aging Research Center, Karolinska Institute"}, "57191403754": {"Name": "Sorbera C.", "AuthorID": "57191403754", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina"}, "6507280866": {"Name": "Morgante F.", "AuthorID": "6507280866", "AffiliationID": "60011576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Messina"}, "25228089900": {"Name": "Stenner M.", "AuthorID": "25228089900", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke University Hospital Magdeburg"}}}
