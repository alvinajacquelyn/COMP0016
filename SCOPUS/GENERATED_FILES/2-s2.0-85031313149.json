It argues that the hieromonk Simeon Polotskii (1629-1680) established its foundations through his public role as Russia's first professional poet, articulated in his two baroque collections of panegyric and didactic verse and rhymed Psalter. Simeon's contribution was shaped by the polemical interaction of Graeco-Slavic orthodoxy with Latin Catholicism, and reveals the strategies he adopted to validate his moral authority in relation to the tsar and clergy. His prophetic legacy was developed by Peter the Great's biographer, Krekshin, Derzhavin, and Pushkin.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031313149", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"35177422300": {"Name": "Davidson P.", "AuthorID": "35177422300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
