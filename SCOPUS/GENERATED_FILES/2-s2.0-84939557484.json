In vitro angiogenesis assays are based on the innate ability of endothelial cells to migrate and form tube like structures in response to VEGF stimulation. Although they are arguably not as physiologically relevant as in vivo angiogenesis models they still represent a relatively quick and useful method for looking at VEGF function. There are several different methods for studying in vitro angiogenesis and these are detailed here along with protocols for image capture and analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coculture", "Collagen", "Endothelium angiogenesis", "Matrigel", "VEGF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cells, Cultured", "Coculture Techniques", "Collagen", "Drug Combinations", "Endothelial Cells", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Laminin", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Proteoglycans"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939557484", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7103109629": {"Name": "Evans I.", "AuthorID": "7103109629", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
