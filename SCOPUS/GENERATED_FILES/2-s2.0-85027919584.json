Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.The prevalence of healthcare-associated infection caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria is of critical concern worldwide. It is reported on the development of a bactericidal surface prepared by use of a simple, upscalable, two-step dipping strategy to incorporate crystal violet and di(octyl)-phosphinic- acid-capped zinc oxide nanoparticles into medical grade silicone, as a strategy to reduce the risk of infection. The material is characterized by UV-vis absorbance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and confirmed the incorporation of the ZnO nanoparticles in the polymer. The novel system proves to be a highly versatile bactericidal material when tested against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, key causative micro-organisms for hospital-acquired infection (HAI). Potent antimicrobial activity is noted under dark conditions, with a significant enhancement exhibits when the surfaces are illuminated with a standard hospital light source. This polymer has the potential to decrease the risk of HAI, by killing bacteria in contact with the surface.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antimicrobial surfaces", "Infection-prevention", "Photodynamic therapy", "Zinc oxide nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-microbial activity", "Antimicrobial polymers", "Antimicrobial surface", "Hospital acquired infection", "Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy", "Infection-prevention", "Staphylococcus aureus", "Zinc oxide nanoparticles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027919584", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55511810300": {"Name": "Noor N.", "AuthorID": "55511810300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55274495600": {"Name": "Weiner J.", "AuthorID": "55274495600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "55476614900": {"Name": "Williams C.", "AuthorID": "55476614900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
