Reductive deprotection of the trityl group from 3 and 4 by reaction with KC8, in the presence of 18-crown-6, affords the thorium oxo complex, [K(18-crown-6)][Th(O)(NR2)3] (6), and the thorium sulphide complex, [K(18-crown-6)][Th(S)(NR2)3] (7), respectively. The natural bond orbital and quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules approaches are employed to explore the metal-ligand bonding in 6 and 7 and their uranium analogues, and in particular the relative roles of the actinide 5f and 6d orbitals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["18-crown-6", "D orbitals", "Metal-ligand bonding", "Multiple bonds", "Natural bond orbital", "Oxo complexes", "Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules", "Reductive deprotection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84935837388", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"41562216200": {"Name": "Smiles D.", "AuthorID": "41562216200", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Santa Barbara"}, "7404975362": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "7404975362", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Santa Barbara"}, "10439046600": {"Name": "Hayton T.", "AuthorID": "10439046600", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California Santa Barbara"}, "7004509648": {"Name": "Kaltsoyannis N.", "AuthorID": "7004509648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
