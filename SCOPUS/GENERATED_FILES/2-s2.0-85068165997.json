The stable isotope labelling kinetics (SILK) technique is based on generating amino acids labelled with naturally occurring stable (that is, nonradioactive) isotopes of carbon and/or nitrogen. These labelled amino acids can then be incorporated into proteins, enabling rates of protein production and clearance to be determined in vivo and in vitro without the use of radioactive or chemical labels. Over the past decade, SILK studies have been used to determine the turnover of key pathogenic proteins amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2), tau and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in the cerebrospinal fluid of healthy individuals, patients with AD and those with other neurodegenerative diseases. These studies led to the identification of several factors that alter the production and/or clearance of these proteins, including age, sleep and disease-causing genetic mutations. SILK studies have also been used to measure A\u03b2 turnover in blood and within brain tissue. SILK studies offer the potential to elucidate the mechanisms underlying various neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, including neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, and to demonstrate target engagement of novel disease-modifying therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Brain", "Humans", "Isotope Labeling", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068165997", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegeneration, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.D.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegeneration, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegeneration, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegeneration, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology"}, "23984716300": {"Name": "Gabelle A.", "AuthorID": "23984716300", "AffiliationID": "60028111, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1163, Institut de M\u00e9decine R\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative, Saint Eloi Hospital"}, "6602802440": {"Name": "Hirtz C.", "AuthorID": "6602802440", "AffiliationID": "60028111, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1163, Institut de M\u00e9decine R\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative, Saint Eloi Hospital"}, "7102616467": {"Name": "Lehmann S.", "AuthorID": "7102616467", "AffiliationID": "60028111, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1163, Institut de M\u00e9decine R\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rative, Saint Eloi Hospital"}, "7004323340": {"Name": "Lucey B.P.", "AuthorID": "7004323340", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "54388086300": {"Name": "Barth\u00e9lemy N.R.", "AuthorID": "54388086300", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "57192929825": {"Name": "Sato C.", "AuthorID": "57192929825", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "35244107100": {"Name": "Wildburger N.C.", "AuthorID": "35244107100", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7403948833": {"Name": "Miller T.M.", "AuthorID": "7403948833", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "27169448500": {"Name": "Bateman R.J.", "AuthorID": "27169448500", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "57219827502": {"Name": "Leckey C.A.", "AuthorID": "57219827502", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology"}, "19934657400": {"Name": "Wray S.", "AuthorID": "19934657400", "AffiliationID": "60109771", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology"}, "7202117114": {"Name": "Patterson B.W.", "AuthorID": "7202117114", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "24448839500": {"Name": "West T.", "AuthorID": "24448839500", "AffiliationID": "100847876", "AffiliationName": "C2N Diagnostics, Center for Emerging Technologies"}, "7006521106": {"Name": "Yarasheski K.", "AuthorID": "7006521106", "AffiliationID": "100847876", "AffiliationName": "C2N Diagnostics, Center for Emerging Technologies"}, "24460265800": {"Name": "Karch C.M.", "AuthorID": "24460265800", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Washington University"}, "6603873461": {"Name": "Elbert D.L.", "AuthorID": "6603873461", "AffiliationID": "60122541, 60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin"}}}
