The report argued that healthy growth across adolescence and young adulthood shapes life course and intergenerational trajectories so that health investments yield a \u201ctriple dividend.\u201d With current global interest in adolescent health at an unprecedented level, it outlines three next steps to advance from advocacy to effective action: (1) there is a pressing need for comprehensive and integrated strategies, inclusive of, but extending beyond, sexual and reproductive health, and HIV; (2) interventions should address both adolescent health service coverage and determinants of health that lie in sectors such as education, justice, transport, and industry and employment, as well as families and local communities; and (3) scale-up of responses will require not only investments in country-level capacities for measuring need and responding with evidence-based practice but also the establishment of processes for accountability and meaningful youth engagement.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Global health", "Young adult"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Health", "Adolescent Health Services", "Adult", "Global Health", "Humans", "Reproductive Health", "Sexual Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991666844", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7102184358": {"Name": "Patton G.C.", "AuthorID": "7102184358", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne"}, "7103253172": {"Name": "Sawyer S.M.", "AuthorID": "7103253172", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne"}, "57199458877": {"Name": "Ross D.A.", "AuthorID": "57199458877", "AffiliationID": "60027142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health, World Health Organization"}, "7005899067": {"Name": "Viner R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005899067", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7005214325": {"Name": "Santelli J.S.", "AuthorID": "7005214325", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"}}}
