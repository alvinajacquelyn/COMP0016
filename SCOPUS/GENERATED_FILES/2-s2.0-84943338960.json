Misfolding of rhodopsin can result in disruptions in cellular protein homeostasis, or proteostasis. There is currently no available treatment for RP. In this review, we discuss the different approaches currently being investigated for treatment of rhodopsin RP, focusing on the potential of manipulation of the proteostasis network as a therapeutic approach to combat retinal degeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ERAD", "Heat shock proteins", "Molecular chaperones", "P23H", "Proteostasis", "Retinal degeneration", "Retinitis pigmentosa", "Rhodopsin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Mutation", "Proteostasis Deficiencies", "Retinaldehyde", "Retinitis Pigmentosa", "Rhodopsin"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943338960", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"26433798600": {"Name": "Parfitt D.", "AuthorID": "26433798600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57204676942": {"Name": "Cheetham M.", "AuthorID": "57204676942", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Biology and Therapeutics, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
