After initial stabilisation and airway management, clinicians are presented with a complex multisystemic problem, frequently requiring a multidisciplinary approach involving several surgical disciplines and associated therapies. A new multidisciplinary team was convened to discuss complex ingestion injury in adults and established techniques were used to bring forward a proposed treatment algorithm. An algorithm may potentially improve clinical efficacy and risk in the management of these complex patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caustics", "Deglutition disorders", "Injury", "Laryngostenosis", "Self-injurious behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Burns, Chemical", "Caustics", "Esophagus", "Female", "Humans", "Suicide, Attempted", "Trachea", "Tracheostomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929832226", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"57220274641": {"Name": "Rollin M.", "AuthorID": "57220274641", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "37034152600": {"Name": "Jaulim A.", "AuthorID": "37034152600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55598033300": {"Name": "Vaz F.", "AuthorID": "55598033300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6505884598": {"Name": "Dawas K.", "AuthorID": "6505884598", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57219561049": {"Name": "Sandhu G.", "AuthorID": "57219561049", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "12783169800": {"Name": "Wood S.", "AuthorID": "12783169800", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
