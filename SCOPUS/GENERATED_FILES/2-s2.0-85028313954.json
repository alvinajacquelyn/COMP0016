Published by The Geological Society of London.The Andaman Flysch of Oligocene age comprises basinal-scale deposits of marine turbidites from an axially fed submarine fan. It is intermittently exposed across the entire chain of the Andaman-Nicobar Islands from the northernmost tip ofNorth Andaman to the southernmost part of Great Nicobar. This chapter reviews the field and petrographic attributes, heavy mineral assemblages, major and trace elements, and isotope geochemistry of the most accessible outcrops on the main Andaman islands.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028313954", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"36944794300": {"Name": "Bandopadhyay P.C.", "AuthorID": "36944794300", "AffiliationID": "60024232", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Calcutta"}, "56003358600": {"Name": "Carter A.", "AuthorID": "56003358600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}}}
