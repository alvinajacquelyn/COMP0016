We show here that this phenomenon is not restricted to thermal equilibrium, rather it survives more generally in a dissipative highly nonequilibrium system driven into a steady state. By considering a quantum fluid of polaritons of an experimentally relevant size, in the so-called optical parametric oscillator regime, we demonstrate that it indeed undergoes a phase transition associated with a vortex binding-unbinding mechanism. Yet, the exponent of the power-law decay of the first-order correlation function in the (algebraically) ordered phase can exceed the equilibrium upper limit: this shows that the ordered phase of driven-dissipative systems can sustain a higher level of collective excitations before the order is destroyed by topological defects. Our work suggests that the macroscopic coherence phenomena, observed recently in interacting twodimensional light-matter systems, result from a nonequilibrium phase transition of the Berezinskii- Kosterlitz-Thouless rather than the Bose-Einstein condensation type.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Collective excitations", "Continuous symmetry", "Correlation function", "Dissipative systems", "Nonequilibrium phase transitions", "Nonequilibrium system", "Thermal equilibriums", "Two-dimensional systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951174717", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57015614300": {"Name": "Dagvadorj G.", "AuthorID": "57015614300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "35172894400": {"Name": "Fellows J.", "AuthorID": "35172894400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}, "6602817369": {"Name": "Matyja\u015bkiewicz S.", "AuthorID": "6602817369", "AffiliationID": "113470346", "AffiliationName": "Department of Risk Methodology, Nomura International Plc"}, "56207776100": {"Name": "Marchetti F.", "AuthorID": "56207776100", "AffiliationID": "60026796, 60106502", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Fisica Teorica de la Materia Condensada and Condensed Matter Physics Center (IFIMAC), Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid"}, "7003588359": {"Name": "Carusotto I.", "AuthorID": "7003588359", "AffiliationID": "60015986, 60021199", "AffiliationName": "INO-CNR BEC Center and Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit\u00e0 di Trento"}, "7004604921": {"Name": "Szyma\u0144ska M.", "AuthorID": "7004604921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
