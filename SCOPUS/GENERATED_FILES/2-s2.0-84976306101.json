However, it is unknown whether release of the protective factor depends on vagal activation or occurs independently. This study aimed to evaluate the co-dependence of the neural and humoral pathways of RIC, focussing on the vagus nerve and intrinsic cardiac ganglia. In the first study, anesthetised rats received bilateral cervical vagotomy or sham-surgery immediately prior to RIC (4 \u00d7 5 min limb ischemia\u2013reperfusion) or sham-RIC. Venous blood plasma was dialysed across a 12\u201314 kDa membrane and dialysate perfused through a na\u00efve-isolated rat heart prior to 35-min left anterior descending ischemia and 60-min reperfusion. In the second study, anesthetised rats received RIC (4 \u00d7 5-min limb ischemia\u2013reperfusion) or control (sham-RIC). Dialysate was prepared and perfused through a na\u00efve-isolated rat heart in the presence of the ganglionic blocker hexamethonium or muscarinic antagonist atropine, prior to ischemia\u2013reperfusion as above. Dialysate collected from RIC-treated rats reduced infarct size in na\u00efve rat hearts from 40.7 \u00b1 6.3 to 23.7 \u00b1 3.1 %, p < 0.05. Following bilateral cervical vagotomy, the protection of RIC dialysate was abrogated (42.2 \u00b1 3.2 %, p < 0.05 vs RIC dialysate). In the second study, the administration of 50-\u03bcM hexamethonium (45.8 \u00b1 2.5 %) or 100-nM atropine (36.5 \u00b1 3.4 %) abrogated the dialysate-mediated protection. Release of a protective factor following RIC is dependent on prior activation of the vagus nerve. In addition, this factor appears to induce cardioprotection via recruitment of intrinsic cardiac ganglia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomic nervous system", "Intrinsic cardiac ganglia", "Myocardial infarction", "Remote ischemic conditioning", "Vagus nerve"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Heart", "Hindlimb", "Ischemia", "Ischemic Preconditioning", "Male", "Myocardial Infarction", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Vagus Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976306101", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56530244300": {"Name": "Pickard J.", "AuthorID": "56530244300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "7103223278": {"Name": "Yellon D.", "AuthorID": "7103223278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}}}
