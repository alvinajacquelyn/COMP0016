Methods: We used data on patients diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the East of England (2006\u20132010) to estimate the number of deaths that could be postponed by completely eliminating socioeconomic and sex differences in stage at diagnosis after fitting a flexible parametric excess mortality model. Results: Stage was a strong predictor of survival. There were pronounced socioeconomic and sex inequalities in the proportion of patients diagnosed at stages III\u2013IV (12 and 8% for least deprived men and women and 25 and 18% for most deprived men and women, respectively). For an annual cohort of 1025 incident cases in the East of England, eliminating sex and deprivation differences in stage at diagnosis would postpone approximately 24 deaths to beyond 5 years from diagnosis. Using appropriate weighting, the equivalent estimate for England would be around 215 deaths, representing 11% of all deaths observed within 5 years from diagnosis in this population. Conclusions: Reducing socioeconomic and sex inequalities in stage at diagnosis would result in substantial reductions in deaths within 5 years of a melanoma diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Avoidable deaths", "Excess mortality models", "Sex inequalities", "Socioeconomic inequalities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "England", "Female", "Health Status Disparities", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Male", "Melanoma", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Mortality", "Neoplasm Staging", "Sex Factors", "Skin Neoplasms", "Social Class", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027942811", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"36816409300": {"Name": "Rutherford M.J.", "AuthorID": "36816409300", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7402303348": {"Name": "Lambert P.C.", "AuthorID": "7402303348", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56436839400": {"Name": "Ironmonger L.", "AuthorID": "56436839400", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK"}, "23498661500": {"Name": "Ormiston-Smith N.", "AuthorID": "23498661500", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK"}, "57202757335": {"Name": "Abel G.A.", "AuthorID": "57202757335", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Institute of Public Health, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "35495386300": {"Name": "Greenberg D.C.", "AuthorID": "35495386300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registration Service, Public Health England"}, "6603557582": {"Name": "Lyratzopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "6603557582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epedimiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
