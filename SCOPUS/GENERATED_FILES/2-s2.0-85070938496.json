However, the mechanism governing the shape of collagen fibrils is poorly understood. Here, we report that the protein Osteomodulin (OMD) of the SLRP family is a monomeric protein in solution that interacts with type-I collagen. This interaction is dominated by weak electrostatic forces employing negatively charged residues of OMD, in particular Glu284 and Glu303, and controlled by entropic factors. The protein OMD establishes a fast-binding equilibrium with collagen, where OMD may engage not only with individual collagen molecules, but also with the growing fibrils. This weak electrostatic interaction is carefully balanced so it modulates the shape of the fibrils without compromising their viability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070938496", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"56659283200": {"Name": "Tashima T.", "AuthorID": "56659283200", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry & Biotechnology, School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo"}, "7006370703": {"Name": "Tsumoto K.", "AuthorID": "7006370703", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Proteomics Laboratory, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"}, "8535816700": {"Name": "Nagatoishi S.", "AuthorID": "8535816700", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Proteomics Laboratory, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"}, "57194713034": {"Name": "Caaveiro J.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57194713034", "AffiliationID": "60011047", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Global Healthcare, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyushu University"}, "22954359800": {"Name": "Nakakido M.", "AuthorID": "22954359800", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Proteomics Laboratory, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"}, "7006508210": {"Name": "Sagara H.", "AuthorID": "7006508210", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Medical Proteomics Laboratory, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"}, "48662421000": {"Name": "Kusano-Arai O.", "AuthorID": "48662421000", "AffiliationID": "60103899, 60025272", "AffiliationName": "Quantitative Biology and Medicine, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), The University of Tokyo"}, "6602837880": {"Name": "Iwanari H.", "AuthorID": "6602837880", "AffiliationID": "60103899, 60025272", "AffiliationName": "Quantitative Biology and Medicine, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), The University of Tokyo"}, "57203066754": {"Name": "Hamakubo T.", "AuthorID": "57203066754", "AffiliationID": "60103899, 60025272", "AffiliationName": "Quantitative Biology and Medicine, Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), The University of Tokyo"}, "6602885776": {"Name": "Mimuro H.", "AuthorID": "6602885776", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases Control, International Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo"}, "7004830285": {"Name": "Ohnuma S.i.", "AuthorID": "7004830285", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London (UCL)"}}}
