During disease, \u03b1-syn undergoes conformational changes to form oligomers and high molecular weight aggregates that tend to make the protein more insoluble. Abnormally aggregated \u03b1-syn is a neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Biochemical characterization and analysis of insoluble \u03b1-syn using buffers with increasing detergent strength and high-speed ultracentrifugation provides a powerful tool to determine the development of \u03b1-syn pathology associated with disease progression. This protocol describes the isolation of increasingly insoluble/aggregated \u03b1-syn from post-mortem human brain tissue. This methodology can be adapted with modifications to studies of normal and abnormal \u03b1-syn biology in transgenic animal models harbouring different \u03b1-syn mutations as well as in other neurodegenerative diseases that feature aberrant fibrillar deposits of proteins related to their respective pathologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregation", "Alpha-synuclein", "Immunoblotting", "Insoluble alpha-synuclein", "Issue 107", "Lewy body", "Neuroscience", "Parkinson's disease", "Post-mortem brain", "Ultracentrifugation"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Synuclein", "Brain", "Brain Chemistry", "Humans", "Neurons", "Parkinson Disease", "Protein Aggregation, Pathological", "Ultracentrifugation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954473872", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"6603278141": {"Name": "Bandopadhyay R.", "AuthorID": "6603278141", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
