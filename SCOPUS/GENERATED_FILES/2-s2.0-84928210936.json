All rights reserved.Objective: To investigate longer-term physical and neurodevelopmental outcomes of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) compared with other patients with functionally single-ventricle circulation surviving beyond the age of 10 years. Design: A retrospective, observational study from a UK tertiary centre for paediatric cardiology. Results: 58 patients with HLHS and 44 non-HLHS patients with single-ventricle physiology were included. Subjective reduction in exercise tolerance was reported in 72% (95% CI 61% to 84%) of patients with HLHS and 45% (31% to 60%) non-HLHS patients. Compared with non-HLHS patients, educational concerns were reported more frequently in patients with HLHS, 41% (29% to 54%) vs 23% (10% to 35%), as was a diagnosis of a behaviour disorder (autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) 12% (4% to 21%) vs 0%, and referral to other specialist services 67% (55% to 79%) vs 48% (33% to 63%). Conclusions: Within a group of young people with complex congenital heart disease, those with HLHS are likely to have worse physical, psychological and educational outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child Behavior Disorders", "Child Development", "Female", "Great Britain", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome", "Male", "Psychomotor Performance", "Referral and Consultation", "Retrospective Studies", "Tertiary Care Centers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928210936", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56780896700": {"Name": "Davidson J.", "AuthorID": "56780896700", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London School of Medicine"}, "57202948079": {"Name": "Gringras P.", "AuthorID": "57202948079", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Fiundation Trust"}, "15076634900": {"Name": "Fairhurst C.", "AuthorID": "15076634900", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Fiundation Trust"}, "7404325466": {"Name": "Simpson J.", "AuthorID": "7404325466", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Congenital Heart Disease, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Fiundation Trust"}}}
