Here we study water diffusion in exfoliated nontronite clay dispersions by diffusion NMR and time-dependant 1H-NMR-imaging profiles. The dispersion clay concentration was varied between 0.3 and 0.7. vol%. After magnetic alignment of the clay particles in these dispersions a maximum difference of 20% was measured between the parallel and perpendicular self-diffusion coefficients in the dispersion with 0.7. vol% clay. A method was developed to measure water diffusion within the dispersion in the absence of a magnetic field (random clay orientation) as this is not possible with standard diffusion NMR. However, no significant difference in self-diffusion coefficient between random and aligned dispersions could be observed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anisotropic microstructure", "Bound water", "Diffusion", "Diffusion NMR", "Exfoliated clay", "Magnetic alignment", "NMR 1D imaging", "Nontronite clay", "Permeability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropic microstructures", "Bound waters", "Diffusion NMR", "Exfoliated clay", "Magnetic alignment", "Nontronites", "Aluminum Silicates", "Diffusion", "Magnetics", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908331427", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"56462633500": {"Name": "Abrahamsson C.", "AuthorID": "56462633500", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "SuMo Biomaterials, VINN Excellence Centre, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "13607242500": {"Name": "Nordstierna L.", "AuthorID": "13607242500", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Applied Surface Chemistry, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "35072951500": {"Name": "Nordin M.", "AuthorID": "35072951500", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "German Cancer Research Center, Medical Physics in Radiology"}, "7003659601": {"Name": "Dvinskikh S.V.", "AuthorID": "7003659601", "AffiliationID": "60031888", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Biomolecular NMR, St. Petersburg State University"}, "35577381600": {"Name": "Nyd\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "35577381600", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Ian Wark Research Institute, University of South Australia"}}}
