We investigated the prevalence of and factors associated with types of CLS. Methods Cross-sectional questionnaire study in UK HIV clinics in 2011/2012 (ASTRA). MSM diagnosed with HIV for \u22653 months reported on anal and vaginal sex, CLS with HIV-serodifferent partners (CLS-D) and CLS with HIV-seroconcordant (CLS-C) partners in the previous 3 months. Mutually exclusive sexual behaviours were as follows: (1) Higher HIV risk CLS-D (not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or clinic-recorded viral load(VL) >50 c/mL), (2) Other CLS-D, (3) CLS-C without CLS-D, (4) Condom-protected sex only and (5) No anal or vaginal sex. Associations were examined of sociodemographic, HIV-related, lifestyle, and other sexual measures with the five categories of sexual behaviour. We examined the prevalence of higher HIV risk CLS-D incorporating (in addition to ART and VL) time on ART, ART non-adherence, and recent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Results Among 2189 HIV-diagnosed MSM (87% on ART), prevalence of any CLS in the past 3 months was 38.2% (95% CI 36.2% to 40.4%) and that of any CLS-D was 16.3% (14.8%-17.9%). The five-category classification was as follows: (1) Higher HIV risk CLS-D: 4.2% (3.5% to 5.2%), (2) Other CLS-D: 12.1% (10.8% to 13.5%), (3) CLS-C without CLS-D: 21.9% (20.2% to 23.7%), (4) Condom-protected sex only: 25.4% (23.6% to 27.3%) and (5) No anal or vaginal sex: 36.4% (34.3% to 38.4%). Compared with men who reported condom-protected sex only, MSM who reported any CLS in the past 3 months had higher prevalence of STIs, chemsex-associated drug use, group sex, higher partner numbers, and lifetime hepatitis C. Prevalence of higher HIV risk CLS-D ranged from 4.2% to 7.5% according to criteria included. Conclusion CLS was prevalent among HIV-diagnosed MSM, but CLS-D with higher HIV transmission risk was overall low. CLS-D is no longer the most appropriate measure of HIV transmission risk behaviour among people with diagnosed HIV; accounting for VL is important.", "AuthorKeywords": ["drug misuse", "epidemiology (general)", "Gay men", "HIV", "sexual behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Condoms", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "HIV Infections", "Homosexuality, Male", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk-Taking", "RNA, Viral", "Sexual Behavior", "Sexual Partners", "United Kingdom", "Unsafe Sex", "Viral Load"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037146616", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"37033697800": {"Name": "Daskalopoulou M.", "AuthorID": "37033697800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "35944368900": {"Name": "Rodger A.J.", "AuthorID": "35944368900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.N.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "35847280700": {"Name": "Sherr L.", "AuthorID": "35847280700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "55881781900": {"Name": "McDonnell J.", "AuthorID": "55881781900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57203665921": {"Name": "Johnson A.M.", "AuthorID": "57203665921", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "55881697100": {"Name": "Speakman A.", "AuthorID": "55881697100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57027378700": {"Name": "Lampe F.C.", "AuthorID": "57027378700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7005464613": {"Name": "Elford J.", "AuthorID": "7005464613", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University London"}, "56601072600": {"Name": "Edwards S.", "AuthorID": "56601072600", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25822615600": {"Name": "Perry N.", "AuthorID": "25822615600", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7103182055": {"Name": "Wilkins E.", "AuthorID": "7103182055", "AffiliationID": "60009274", "AffiliationName": "Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55929134500": {"Name": "Collins S.", "AuthorID": "55929134500", "AffiliationID": "60138902", "AffiliationName": "HIV I-Base"}, "7005482634": {"Name": "Burman W.J.", "AuthorID": "7005482634", "AffiliationID": "60018665", "AffiliationName": "Denver Public Health"}}}
