All rights reserved.Objective. Around one-third of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) fail to respond to first-line methotrexate (MTX) or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, with even fewer achieving \u2265 American College of Rheumatology Pediatric 70% criteria for response (ACRpedi70), though individual responses cannot yet be accurately predicted. Because change in serum S100-protein myeloid-related protein complex 8/14 (MRP8/14) is associated with therapeutic response, we tested granulocyte-specific S100-protein S100A12 as a potential biomarker for treatment response. Methods. S100A12 serum concentration was determined by ELISA in patients treated with MTX (n = 75) and anti-TNF (n = 88) at baseline and followup. Treatment response (\u2265 ACRpedi50 score), achievement of inactive disease, and improvement in Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS)-10 score were recorded. Results. Baseline S100A12 concentration was measured in patients treated with anti-TNF [etanercept n = 81, adalimumab n = 7; median 200, interquartile range (IQR) 133-440 ng/ml] and MTX (median 220, IQR 100-440 ng/ml). Of the patients in the anti-TNF therapy group, 74 (84%) were also receiving MTX. Responders to MTX (n = 57/75) and anti-TNF (n = 66/88) therapy had higher baseline S100A12 concentration compared to nonresponders: median 240 (IQR 125-615) ng/ml versus 150 (IQR 87-233) ng/ml, p = 0.021 for MTX, and median 308 (IQR 150-624) ng/ml versus 151 (IQR 83-201) ng/ml, p = 0.002, for anti-TNF therapy. Followup S100A12 could be measured in 44/75 MTX-treated patients (34/44 responders) and 39/88 anti-TNF-treated patients (26/39 responders). Responders had significantly reduced S100A12 concentration (MTX: p = 0.031, anti-TNF: p < 0.001) at followup versus baseline. Baseline serum S100A12 in both univariate and multivariate regression models for anti-TNF therapy and univariate analysis alone for MTX therapy was significantly associated with change in JADAS-10. Conclusion. Responders to MTX or anti-TNF treatment can be identified by higher pretreatment S100A12 serum concentration levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biological markers", "Biological therapy", "Juvenile idiopathic arthritis", "Pediatric rheumatic diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Arthritis, Juvenile", "Biomarkers", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Linear Models", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Methotrexate", "Multivariate Analysis", "S100A12 Protein", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "Treatment Outcome", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044720694", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"23968746900": {"Name": "Gohar F.", "AuthorID": "23968746900", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "55257889900": {"Name": "Anink J.", "AuthorID": "55257889900", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "7003374786": {"Name": "Van Suijlekom-Smit L.W.A.", "AuthorID": "7003374786", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "16304617700": {"Name": "Prince F.H.M.", "AuthorID": "16304617700", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "8323788900": {"Name": "Moncrieffe H.", "AuthorID": "8323788900", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "35467968800": {"Name": "Van Rossum M.A.J.", "AuthorID": "35467968800", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "6603769469": {"Name": "Dolman K.M.", "AuthorID": "6603769469", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "6507956304": {"Name": "Hoppenreijs E.P.A.H.", "AuthorID": "6507956304", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "7004134035": {"Name": "Ten Cate R.", "AuthorID": "7004134035", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "8866204700": {"Name": "Ursu S.", "AuthorID": "8866204700", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "7004250589": {"Name": "Wedderburn L.R.", "AuthorID": "7004250589", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "55391307300": {"Name": "Horneff G.", "AuthorID": "55391307300", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "7103306266": {"Name": "Frosch M.", "AuthorID": "7103306266", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "6603733757": {"Name": "Foell D.", "AuthorID": "6603733757", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}, "57189855105": {"Name": "Holzinger D.", "AuthorID": "57189855105", "AffiliationID": "60030440, 60025152, 60017412", "AffiliationName": null}}}
