The autosomal dominant hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis and the acquired light-chain amyloidosis, the result of a plasma cell dyscrasia, are multisystem disorders with cardiovascular, autonomic and peripheral nerve involvement. There are numerous investigational modalities available to diagnose systemic amyloidosis and to assess the extent of organ involvement, but it is frequently misdiagnosed due to its heterogeneous clinical presentations and misleading investigation findings. An accurate and timely diagnosis of amyloid neuropathy can greatly impact on the outcomes for patients, especially as there will soon be new gene-silencing treatments for hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloid", "neuropathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Amyloid", "Amyloid Neuropathies", "Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Amyloidosis", "Female", "Humans", "Peripheral Nerves", "Prealbumin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059780058", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57201349598": {"Name": "Kapoor M.", "AuthorID": "57201349598", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57218107544": {"Name": "Rossor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57218107544", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.T.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroimmunology, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "54083212800": {"Name": "Jaunmuktane Z.", "AuthorID": "54083212800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuropathology, UCL Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
