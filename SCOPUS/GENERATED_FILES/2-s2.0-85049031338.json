Comprehensive and accurate rotation-vibrational line lists and partition functions are computed for 12 isotopologues of silicon sulphide (28Si32S, 28Si34S, 29Si32S, 28Si33S, 30Si32S, 29Si34S, 30Si34S, 28Si36S, 29Si33S, 29Si36S, 30Si33S, and 30Si36S) in its ground (X 1\u03a3+) electronic state. The calculations employ an existing spectroscopically accurate potential energy curve (PEC) derived from experimental measurements and a newly computed ab initio dipolemoment curve (DMC). The 28Si32S line list includes 10 104 states and 91 715 transitions. These line lists are available from the ExoMol website (www.exomol.com) and the CDS data base.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astronomical data bases: miscellaneous", "Molecular data", "Opacity", "Planets and satellites: atmospheres", "Stars: low-mass"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049031338", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57203641614": {"Name": "Upadhyay A.", "AuthorID": "57203641614", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57203638185": {"Name": "Conway E.K.", "AuthorID": "57203638185", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
