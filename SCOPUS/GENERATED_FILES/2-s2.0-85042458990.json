All rights reserved.Purpose of review Trials of physical rehabilitation post critical illness have yet to deliver improved health-related quality of life in critical illness survivors. Muscle mass and strength are lost rapidly in critical illness and a proportion of patients continue to do so resulting in increased mortality and functional disability. Addressing this issue is therefore fundamental for recovery from critical illness. Recent findings Altered mitochondrial function occurs in the critically ill and is likely to result in decreased adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) production. Muscle contraction is a process that requires ATP. The metabolic demands of exercise are poorly understood in the ICU setting. Recent research has highlighted that there is significant heterogeneity in energy requirements between critically ill individuals undertaking the same functional activities, such as sit-to-stand. Nutrition in the critically ill is currently thought of in terms of carbohydrates, fat and protein. It may be that we need to consider nutrition in a more contextual manner such as energy generation or management of protein homeostasis. Summary Current nutritional support practices in critically ill patients do not lead to improvements in physical and functional outcomes, and it may be that alternative methods of delivery or substrates are needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["critically ill", "exercise", "muscle wasting", "nutrition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Critical Illness", "Energy Metabolism", "Exercise Therapy", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Nutritional Requirements", "Nutritional Status", "Quality of Life", "Recovery of Function", "Resistance Training"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042458990", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55967669300": {"Name": "Bear D.E.", "AuthorID": "55967669300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Lane Fox Research Unit, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55624923600": {"Name": "Parry S.M.", "AuthorID": "55624923600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiotherapy, University of Melbourne"}, "6508205361": {"Name": "Puthucheary Z.A.", "AuthorID": "6508205361", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health"}}}
