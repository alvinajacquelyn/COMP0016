Typhi was an uncommon cause of bloodstream infection (BSI) in Blantyre, Malawi and it was usually susceptible to first-line antimicrobial therapy. In 2011 an increase in a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain was detected through routine bacteriological surveillance conducted at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH). Methods: Longitudinal trends in culture-confirmed Typhoid admissions at QECH were described between 1998\u20132014. A retrospective review of patient cases notes was conducted, focusing on clinical presentation, prevalence of HIV and case-fatality. Isolates of S. Typhi were sequenced and the phylogeny of Typhoid in Blantyre was reconstructed and placed in a global context. Results: Between 1998\u20132010, there were a mean of 14 microbiological diagnoses of Typhoid/year at QECH, of which 6.8% were MDR. This increased to 67 in 2011 and 782 in 2014 at which time 97% were MDR. The disease predominantly affected children and young adults (median age 11 [IQR 6-21] in 2014). The prevalence of HIV in adult patients was 16.7% [8/48], similar to that of the general population (17.8%). Overall, the case fatality rate was 2.5% (3/94). Complications included anaemia, myocarditis, pneumonia and intestinal perforation. 112 isolates were sequenced and the phylogeny demonstrated the introduction and clonal expansion of the H58 lineage of S. Typhi. Conclusions: Since 2011, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of multidrug resistant, H58-lineage Typhoid in Blantyre. This is one of a number of reports of the re-emergence of Typhoid in Southern and Eastern Africa. There is an urgent need to understand the reservoirs and transmission of disease and how to arrest this regional increase.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Base Sequence", "Child", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Malawi", "Male", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Phylogeny", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Salmonella typhi", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Typhoid Fever"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929492305", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"36479968900": {"Name": "Feasey N.A.", "AuthorID": "36479968900", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "56632974800": {"Name": "Gaskell K.", "AuthorID": "56632974800", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "23995586900": {"Name": "Msefula C.", "AuthorID": "23995586900", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "56648090100": {"Name": "Selemani G.", "AuthorID": "56648090100", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "25031537700": {"Name": "Mallewa J.", "AuthorID": "25031537700", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "56643932100": {"Name": "Bennett A.", "AuthorID": "56643932100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "35622677700": {"Name": "Wong V.", "AuthorID": "35622677700", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "57212237926": {"Name": "Parkhill J.", "AuthorID": "57212237926", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "7102366949": {"Name": "Dougan G.", "AuthorID": "7102366949", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "7004261268": {"Name": "Allain T.J.", "AuthorID": "7004261268", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "7101730459": {"Name": "Kennedy N.", "AuthorID": "7101730459", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "6504115036": {"Name": "Nyirongo J.O.", "AuthorID": "6504115036", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "56648126800": {"Name": "Nyondo P.A.", "AuthorID": "56648126800", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "56647983700": {"Name": "Zulu M.D.", "AuthorID": "56647983700", "AffiliationID": "60072664", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi College of Medicine"}, "42961939400": {"Name": "Kumwenda S.", "AuthorID": "42961939400", "AffiliationID": "60072660", "AffiliationName": "University of Malawi, The Polytechnic"}, "7402800616": {"Name": "Gordon M.A.", "AuthorID": "7402800616", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}}}
