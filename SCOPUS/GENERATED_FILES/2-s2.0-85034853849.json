This work improves thermo-mechanical understanding via examination of nickel-based anode materials using synchrotron X-ray diffraction; two cermet materials are studied: Ni-YSZ and Ni-GDC, with comparison to a ceramic-free Ni sample. Findings conclude that although the ceramic addition has minor effects on the cubic Ni structure within isothermal environments, stress induced by the different thermal properties within the cermet materials results in a shifted Ni thermal expansion peak on passing the Curie point. Moreover, extended cycling of the Ni-YSZ sample suggests that low-temperature operation (ca. 600 \u00b0C) may require several thermal cycles, or extended dwell times, to alleviate residual Ni stresses, this has potential implications for SOFC design and operation strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Curie temperature", "Degradation", "Ni-YSZ", "SOFC", "XRD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design and operations", "Electrolyte layers", "Solid oxide fuel cell anodes", "Stress-induced", "Synchrotron x ray diffraction", "Thermal expansion mismatch", "Thermo-mechanical", "Triple phase boundary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034853849", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57044825000": {"Name": "Heenan T.", "AuthorID": "57044825000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "55869997100": {"Name": "Robinson J.", "AuthorID": "55869997100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "57189994070": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "57189994070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "56372219400": {"Name": "Tjaden B.", "AuthorID": "56372219400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "57189988046": {"Name": "Bailey J.", "AuthorID": "57189988046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "6603585784": {"Name": "Cervellino A.", "AuthorID": "6603585784", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institut"}}}
