All rights reserved.Purpose of review In men on active surveillance for localized prostate cancer, MRI and MRI-targeted biopsies can be used prior to confirmatory or surveillance biopsy, to detect individuals with high-grade cancer (the wolf in sheep's clothing). However, some men will have low-risk disease despite adverse MRI findings (the sheep in wolf's clothing). We review the value addition of MRI-targeted biopsies in comparison to systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies, using pathological reclassification as an end-point. Recent findings At confirmatory and surveillance biopsies, both the MRI-targeted and repeat standard biopsies have shown value in identifying histologically adverse findings in men with low-risk prostate cancer. For maximal detection of clinically significant cancer, a prebiopsy MRI should be performed together with both MRI-targeted and systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsies. Stable disease on MRI may reduce the need for serial biopsies in some men on active surveillance. Summary Prostate MRI and subsequent MRI-targeted biopsies are worthwhile to the current management of men with low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. Prostate MRI, in combination with a multivariable risk-prediction model may help in identifying both the wolf in sheep's clothing and the sheep in wolf's clothing, and in potentially reducing the need for serial biopsies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["active surveillance", "biopsies", "monitoring", "MRI", "prostate cancer", "risk prediction", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015677814", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56766141400": {"Name": "Schoots I.G.", "AuthorID": "56766141400", "AffiliationID": "60004250, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine Lyon Est"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospitals Trust"}, "7004766993": {"Name": "Rouvi\u00e8re O.", "AuthorID": "7004766993", "AffiliationID": "109350041", "AffiliationName": "Hospices Civils de Lyon, Department of Urinary and Vascular Imaging, H\u00f4pital Edouard Herriot"}}}
