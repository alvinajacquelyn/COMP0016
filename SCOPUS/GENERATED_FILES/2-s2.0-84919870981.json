However, appropriate clinical outcome measures to be used in clinical trials have not been validated in CMDs. We conducted a two-year pilot study to evaluate feasibility, reliability, and validity of various outcome measures, particularly the Motor Function Measure 32, in 33 subjects with COL6-RD and LAMA2-RD. In the first year, outcome measures tested included: Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM32), forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted sitting, myometry, goniometry, 10-meter walk, Egen Klassification 2, and PedsQLTM Generic and Neuromuscular Cores. In the second year, we added the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA), Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale (HFMS), timed functional tests, Measure of Activity Limitations (ACTIVLIM), Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test (QUEST), and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue subscale. The MFM32 showed strong inter-rater (0.92) and internal consistency (0.96) reliabilities. Concurrent validity for the MFM32 was supported by large correlations (range 0.623-0.936) with the following: FVC, NSAA, HFMS, timed functional tests, ACTIVLIM, and QUEST. Significant correlations of the MFM32 were also found with select myometry measurements, mainly of the proximal extremities and domains of the PedsQLTM scales focusing on physical health and neuromuscular disease. Goniometry measurements were less reliable. The Motor Function Measure is reliable and valid in the two specific subtypes of CMD evaluated, COL6-RD and LAMA2-RD. The NSAA is useful as a complementary outcome measure in ambulatory individuals. Preliminary concurrent validity of several other clinical outcome measures was also demonstrated for these subtypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical outcome measures", "Collagen VI related muscular dystrophy", "Laminin alpha 2 related dystrophy", "Motor function scales", "Neuromuscular disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Adult", "Child", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Child, Preschool", "Collagen Type VI", "Collagen Type VI", "Exercise Test", "Exercise Test", "Female", "Female", "Humans", "Humans", "Laminin", "Laminin", "Male", "Male", "Muscular Dystrophies", "Muscular Dystrophies", "Mutation", "Mutation", "Pilot Projects", "Pilot Projects", "Quality of Life", "Quality of Life", "Reproducibility of Results", "Reproducibility of Results", "Severity of Illness Index", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919870981", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"26428341400": {"Name": "Meilleur K.G.", "AuthorID": "26428341400", "AffiliationID": "60024906, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Nursing Research, NIH"}, "56290884600": {"Name": "Linton M.M.", "AuthorID": "56290884600", "AffiliationID": "60024906, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Nursing Research, NIH"}, "56401920000": {"Name": "Arveson I.C.", "AuthorID": "56401920000", "AffiliationID": "60024906, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Nursing Research, NIH"}, "56226588100": {"Name": "Jain M.S.", "AuthorID": "56226588100", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "Mark O.
