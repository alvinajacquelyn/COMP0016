This work, and other recent studies, demonstrate how the properties of the resultant supported metal nanoparticles can be tailored by adjusting the conditions of colloidal synthesis i.e. temperature and solvent. We further demonstrate the applicability of these methods to the hydrogenation of nitrophenols using a series of tailored Pd/TiO2 catalysts, with low Pd loading of 0.2 wt%. Here, the temperature of colloidal synthesis is directly related to the mean particle diameter and the catalytic activity. Smaller Pd particles (2.2 nm, k = 0.632 min-1, TOF = 560 h-1) perform better than their larger counterparts (2.6 nm, k = 0.350 min-1, TOF = 370 h-1) for the hydrogenation of p-nitrophenol, with the catalyst containing smaller NPs found to have increased stability during recyclability studies, with high activity (>90% conversion after 5 minutes) maintained across 5 catalytic cycles.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052618395", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56204136500": {"Name": "Rogers S.M.", "AuthorID": "56204136500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton Highfield"}, "6507384807": {"Name": "Dimitratos N.", "AuthorID": "6507384807", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "35271498800": {"Name": "Gianolio D.", "AuthorID": "35271498800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
