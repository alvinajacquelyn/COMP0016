Sixteen Mandarin-speaking amusics and 16 matched controls were tested on the intelligibility of news-like Mandarin sentences with natural and flat fundamental frequency (F0) contours (created via speech resynthesis) under four signal-to-noise (SNR) conditions (no noise, +5, 0, and -5dB SNR). While speech intelligibility in quiet and extremely noisy conditions (SNR=-5dB) was not significantly compromised by flattened F0, both amusic and control groups achieved better performance with natural-F0 sentences than flat-F0 sentences under moderately noisy conditions (SNR=+5 and 0dB). Relative to normal listeners, amusics demonstrated reduced speech intelligibility in both quiet and noise, regardless of whether the F0 contours of the sentences were natural or flattened. This deficit in speech intelligibility was not associated with impaired pitch perception in amusia. These findings provide evidence for impaired speech comprehension in congenital amusia, suggesting that the deficit of amusics extends beyond pitch processing and includes segmental processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Congenital amusia", "Music perception", "Noise", "Pitch", "Segment", "Speech comprehension"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Adult", "Auditory Perceptual Disorders", "Auditory Perceptual Disorders", "Comprehension", "Comprehension", "Female", "Female", "Humans", "Humans", "Male", "Male", "Music", "Music", "Pitch Perception", "Pitch Perception", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Speech Perception", "Speech Perception", "Young Adult", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911926850", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55717265000": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "55717265000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "55695016900": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "55695016900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "36611811200": {"Name": "Jiang C.", "AuthorID": "36611811200", "AffiliationID": "60022279", "AffiliationName": "Music College, Shanghai Normal University"}, "55729751200": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "55729751200", "AffiliationID": "60032275", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chinese Minority Language and Classics, Minzu University of China"}, "7403523817": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "7403523817", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Tufts University"}}}
