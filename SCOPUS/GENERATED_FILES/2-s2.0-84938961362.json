Cerebellar abnormalities are thought to underpin neuropathic tremor. Here, we aim to clarify the potential role of the cerebellum in CMT tremor. Methods: We assessed prevalence of tremor by questionnaire in 84 patients with CMT. Of those, 23 patients with CMT with and without arm tremor and healthy controls underwent a clinical assessment, classical eyeblink conditioning, electro-oculography, visuomotor adaptation test, tremor recording with surface EMG and accelerometry, and retrospective correlation with nerve conduction studies to investigate the possible mechanisms of tremor generation. Results: The prevalence study revealed tremor in 21% of patients and in 42% of those it caused impairment of function. Tremor recordings revealed a mild-to-moderate amplitude tremor with a weight load-invariant 7.7. Hz frequency component. Performance on classical eyeblink conditioning, visuomotor adaptation and electro-oculography were no different between tremulous and non-tremulous patients and healthy controls. Conclusions: These results argue against a prominent role for an abnormal cerebellum in tremor generation in the patients studied with CMT. Rather, our results suggest an enhancement of the central neurogenic component of physiological tremor as a possible mechanism for tremor in the patients studied. Significance: This study is the first to propose differing pathogenic mechanisms for subtypes of neuropathic tremor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CMT", "Hereditary", "Motor", "Neuropathy", "Pathophysiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Blinking", "Cerebellar Diseases", "Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease", "Electromyography", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Tremor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938961362", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"36651432300": {"Name": "Saifee T.", "AuthorID": "36651432300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "26535062800": {"Name": "Pare\u00e9s I.", "AuthorID": "26535062800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "37013653800": {"Name": "Kassavetis P.", "AuthorID": "37013653800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6507878404": {"Name": "Sadnicka A.", "AuthorID": "6507878404", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "11940769800": {"Name": "Teo J.", "AuthorID": "11940769800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55251354800": {"Name": "Edwards M.", "AuthorID": "55251354800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department for Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6507711283": {"Name": "Kaski D.", "AuthorID": "6507711283", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Neuro-otology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7103163120": {"Name": "Bronstein A.", "AuthorID": "7103163120", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Academic Department of Neuro-otology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "16157439300": {"Name": "Manji H.", "AuthorID": "16157439300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203175311": {"Name": "Reilly M.", "AuthorID": "57203175311", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, Department of Molecular Neurosciences, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
