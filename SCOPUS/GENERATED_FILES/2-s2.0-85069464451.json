In contrast, cognitive awareness of emotions is mediated by negative feedback from cortical to subcortical areas. Pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) is essential in the modulation of both affect and alexithymia. We considered the interplay between these two mechanisms in the pgACC and their relationship with alexithymia.Method In 68 healthy participants (30 women, age = 26.15 \u00b1 4.22) we tested associations of emotion processing and alexithymia with excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance represented as glutamate (Glu)/GABA in the pgACC measured via magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 7 T.Results Alexithymia was positively correlated with the Glu/GABA ratio (N = 41, p = 0.0393). Further, cognitive self-awareness showed an association with Glu/GABA (N = 52, p = 0.003), which was driven by a correlation with GABA. In contrast, emotion regulation was only correlated with glutamate levels in the pgACC (N = 49, p = 0.008).Conclusion Our results corroborate the importance of the pgACC as a mediating region of alexithymia, reflected in an altered E/I balance. Furthermore, we could specify that this altered balance is linked to a GABA-related modulation of cognitive self-awareness of emotions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alexithymia", "anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)", "emotion regulation", "magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069464451", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57210119447": {"Name": "K\u00fchnel A.", "AuthorID": "57210119447", "AffiliationID": "60002571, 60122653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Research in Psychiatry, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, International Max Planck Research School for Translational Psychiatry (IMPRS-TP)"}, "26322125900": {"Name": "Widmann A.", "AuthorID": "26322125900", "AffiliationID": "60015449, 60005322", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Molecular Psychiatry, Lwl University Hospital, Ruhr University Bochum"}, "55027681600": {"Name": "Colic L.", "AuthorID": "55027681600", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Mood Disorders Research Program, Yale School of Medicine"}, "35315425400": {"Name": "Demenescu L.R.", "AuthorID": "35315425400", "AffiliationID": "115156605", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Affective Neuroimaging Laboratory"}, "57201799458": {"Name": "Leutritz A.L.", "AuthorID": "57201799458", "AffiliationID": "115156605", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Affective Neuroimaging Laboratory"}, "35300798800": {"Name": "Walter M.", "AuthorID": "35300798800", "AffiliationID": "60004898", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics"}, "57209713611": {"Name": "Herrmann L.", "AuthorID": "57209713611", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University T\u00fcbingen"}, "57157764900": {"Name": "Li M.", "AuthorID": "57157764900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, OVGU Magdeburg"}, "12244001000": {"Name": "Grimm S.", "AuthorID": "12244001000", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Psychiatric Hospital, University of Zurich"}, "36017210900": {"Name": "Nolte T.", "AuthorID": "36017210900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
