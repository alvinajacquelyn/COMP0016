Compared to standard methanol induction, sorbitol/methanol (1:1, C-mol/C-mol) mixed induction improved cellular viability from 92.8 \u00b1 0.3% to 97.7 \u00b1 0.1% although resulted in a reduced product yield from 1.65 \u00b1 0.03 g L\u22121 to 1.12 \u00b1 0.07 g L\u22121. On the other hand, average oxygen consumption rate (OUR) dropped from 241.4 \u00b1 21.3 mmol L\u22121 h\u22121 to 145.5 \u00b1 6.7 mmol L\u22121 h\u22121. Cell diameter decreased over time in the mixed induction, resulting in a D50 value of 3.14 \u03bcm at harvest compared to 3.85 \u03bcm with methanol. The reduction in cell size enhanced the maximum dewatering efficiency from 78.1 \u00b1 3.9% to 84.5 \u00b1 3.3% as evaluated by using an established ultra scale-down methodology that models pilot and industrial scale disc stack centrifugation. Seventy host cell proteins (HCPs) were identified in clarified supernatant when using sorbitol/methanol mixed induction regimen. The total number of HCPs identified with standard methanol induction was nearly one hundred. The downstream process advantage of the mixed induction lies in improved product purity by reducing both cell mortality and level of released whole cell proteins. This needs to be balanced and optimised against the observed reduction in product yield during fermentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dewatering", "Host cell proteins", "P. pastoris fermentation", "Sorbitol/methanol mixed induction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular viability", "De-watering efficiencies", "Fermentation performance", "Host cell protein", "Oxygen consumption rate", "P. pastoris", "Sorbitol/methanol mixed induction", "Whole-cell protein", "Biomass", "Cell Survival", "Centrifugation", "Fermentation", "Methanol", "Oxygen", "Pichia", "Recombinant Proteins", "Sorbitol"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067824380", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57209455587": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "57209455587", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "8856685700": {"Name": "Nesbeth D.", "AuthorID": "8856685700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701613219": {"Name": "Keshavarz-Moore E.", "AuthorID": "6701613219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
