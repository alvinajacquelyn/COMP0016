However, the efficacy of moisture barrier coatings remains unproven and they may actually accelerate degradation. This study aimed to investigate the barrier performance of four coating systems following application onto a low hygroscopic tablet formulation containing aspirin as a model moisture sensitive drug. Tablets were prepared by direct compaction and coated with aqueous dispersions of Eudragit\u00ae L30 D-55, Eudragit\u00ae EPO, Opadry\u00ae AMB and Sepifilm\u00ae LP at the vendors' recommended weight gains. Moisture uptake was studied by dynamic vapor sorption at 0 and 75% RH (25 \u00b0C). Accelerated stability studies were undertaken at 75% RH/25 \u00b0C for 90 days and HPLC assay was used to determine aspirin content. Uncoated tablet cores equilibrated rapidly and took up very little water (0.09%). The mean water uptake for coated cores was higher than for the uncoated formulation and varied as follows: 0.19% (Eudragit\u00ae L30 D-55), 0.35% (Opadry\u00ae AMB), 0.49% (Sepifilm\u00ae LP) and 0.76% (Eudragit\u00ae EPO). The level of aspirin decreased in all the samples such that by the time the study was terminated, the mean aspirin recovered was as follows: uncoated cores 80.0%; Eudragit\u00ae L30 D-55 coated cores 78.8%; Opadry\u00ae AMB coated cores 76.2%, Sepifilm\u00ae LP coated cores 76.0% and Eudragit\u00ae EPO coated samples 66.5%. From these results, it is concluded that the efficacy of moisture barrier polymer coatings on low hygroscopic cores is limited, and application of these coatings can, instead, enhance drug degradation in solid dosage forms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerated stability", "Aspirin", "Dicalcium phosphate", "Film coating", "Hydrolysis", "Moisture barrier", "Sorption", "Tablets"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aspirin", "Cellulose", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Drug Stability", "Methacrylates", "Polymers", "Polymethacrylic Acids", "Polyvinyls", "Stearic Acids", "Tablets", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948799823", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"9746857300": {"Name": "Mwesigwa E.", "AuthorID": "9746857300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University of London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.W.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy, University of London"}}}
