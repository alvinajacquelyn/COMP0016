Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate bone regeneration following application of a novel biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP I) composed of microstructured granules of 90% \u03b2-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP)/10% hydroxyapatite (HA) compared to BCP non-microstructured biphasic calcium phosphate with a composite of 60% hydroxyapatite/40% \u03b2-TCP (BCP II) and a deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) at surgically created defects in the mandible of minipigs in a combined approach with guided bone regeneration (GBR). Material and methods: Sixteen minipigs were used for the study. Lower premolars P2, P3, P4 and first molar M1 were extracted. Following 3 months of healing, two defects with a width and depth of 7 mm were created bilaterally in the mandible. The different grafting materials were randomly placed in the created defects and covered by means of a collagen membrane. After 3 and 8 weeks, biopsies were sampled. All specimens were evaluated with descriptive histology and histomorphometric evaluations complemented by micro-CT scan analysis. Results: All three biomaterials presented with higher bone volume at 8 weeks compared to 3 weeks (P < 0.0442). BCP I and DBBM demonstrated a significant higher amount of bone formation compared to BCP II at 8 weeks (P < 0.0328). BCP I also demonstrated a significant higher percentage of remaining graft volume compared to the other test groups both at 3 and 8 weeks (P < 0.0001 to P < 0.0003). Congruently, defects containing BCP I showed a significant higher amount of mineralized tissue compared to the other groups. Conclusions: All the three test materials performed well with regard to bone formation at 8 weeks. BCP I showed significant higher amounts of newly formed bone despite a higher remaining graft volume compared to the other groups. With regard to the regenerative outcome, all the three materials can be recommended for clinical use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alveolar socket", "Bone substitute", "GBR", "Graft", "Guided bone regeneration", "Membranes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bone Regeneration", "Bone Remodeling", "Bone Substitutes", "Collagen", "Hydroxyapatites", "Mandible", "Minerals", "Particle Size", "Porosity", "Surgical Flaps", "Swine", "Swine, Miniature", "Tooth Extraction", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930818955", "SubjectAreas": [["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"]], "AuthorData": {"7003994167": {"Name": "Dahlin C.", "AuthorID": "7003994167", "AffiliationID": "100456866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, N\u00c4L Medical Centre Hospital"}, "53868230300": {"Name": "Obrecht M.", "AuthorID": "53868230300", "AffiliationID": "60069236", "AffiliationName": "Institut Straumann"}, "6603794293": {"Name": "Dard M.", "AuthorID": "6603794293", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology and Implant Dentistry, New York University, College of Dentistry"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Department of Clinical Research, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
