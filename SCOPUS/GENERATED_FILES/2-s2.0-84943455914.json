The condition has been described in association with various syndromes, and in isolation. However, as the data with specific relevance to polyotia is sparse, not only are the precise causative processes of mirror ear unknown, but the paucity of documented cases also lends the operative approach to be daunting. Methods Six patients with eight mirror ears underwent surgical reconstruction at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children. All children were followed from infancy and reviewed in a multidisciplinary setting to coordinate aspects of their care\u2014including plastic surgery, maxillofacial surgery, dentistry, audiology, speech and language pathology, and psychiatry where relevant. Concurrent surgical procedures in addition to mirror ear correction occurred in four patients. Results Pleasing results were achieved in all cases, as reconstruction employed a bespoke approach. Nonetheless, there were unifying principles adhered to, which began in the planning stages by assessing the morphology of the anomalous ear and evaluating the accessory cartilage available for utilization. Deliberate positioning of the incisions, exploiting cartilage remnants to fill the depression of the mirrored ear, and manipulation of excess tissue to reconstruct an anatomically sound tragus were crucial to achieving agreeable aesthetic results. Conclusions Given that it is rarely encountered, the successful reconstruction of a mirrored ear requires a thoughtful surgical approach. With this report, we provide a comprehensive review of this unique type of ear deformity, significantly add to the documented cases of polyotia, and describe our operative technique to recreate a tragus that throws a natural shadow in the conchal bowl and shields the external auditory meatus.
