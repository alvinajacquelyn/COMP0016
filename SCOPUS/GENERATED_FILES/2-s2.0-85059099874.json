Therefore, an innovative integration of digital technologies into museum practice and professional development courses is of great importance. In this article we describe three case studies involving knowledge exchange between universities and cultural heritage institutions. All three projects involved interdisciplinary expertise and the use of novel digital technologies which allow the recording of highly accurate 3D data for the purposes of archiving, research, preservation and public engagement. The first case study is a collaboration between The Postal Museum, the London Museum Group and UCL's Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE) department, which delivered a feasibility study in to the use of 3D technologies for the documentation of metal objects. The second is a project involving UCL CEGE, UCL Digital Humanities and The Wellcome Trust in London, consisting of a training workshop, the development of a new low cost 3D imaging kit and outreach activities. The final study, initiated by the German Maritime Museum together with the Jade University of Applied Science in Oldenburg, is developing a 3D acquisition protocol for monitoring the Bremen Cog, a 14th century ship. Concluding the article are reflections on the lessons learnt and recommendations for fostering capacity building and knowledge exchange. Further conclusions are drawn on the importance of introducing museum and heritage professionals to the latest developments in digital technologies, with examples of learning opportunities in workshops or academic curricula.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D digitisation", "Cultural heritage", "digital heritage", "digital technologies", "knowledge exchange"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059099874", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Museology", "ARTS", "1209"]], "AuthorData": {"38861761200": {"Name": "Hess M.", "AuthorID": "38861761200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57195940228": {"Name": "Colson A.", "AuthorID": "57195940228", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56539793300": {"Name": "Hindmarch J.", "AuthorID": "56539793300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
