Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Metalenses recently have attracted attention because of their more compact size in comparison with conventional lenses; they can also achieve better optical performance with higher resolution. Duplexer is an interesting function of a metalens that can distinguish different sources and divide them into two parts for specific purposes. In this article, we design tunable duplex metalenses with phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5 for the first time. Two types of special unit cells are designed to modulate the incident lights, and four metalenses are designed based on the two types of unit cells. Specific phase profiles are calculated for different sections of metalens in which the corresponding unit cells are settled; accordingly, the metalenses can focus the incident lights at any positions according to our design. Moreover, the metalenses become selectable via tuning the state of phase-change material, which means that the output light field can be actively controlled. The proposal of our tunable duplex metalenses will offer new opportunities for active three-dimensional imaging or optical coding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Duplex metalens", "Nano device", "Phase change materials", "Phase modulation", "Tunable"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85073297157", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57208086316": {"Name": "Bai W.", "AuthorID": "57208086316", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56449774800": {"Name": "Yang P.", "AuthorID": "56449774800", "AffiliationID": "60003302, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optics and Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55767740600": {"Name": "Wang S.", "AuthorID": "55767740600", "AffiliationID": "60003302, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optics and Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56512836700": {"Name": "Xu B.", "AuthorID": "56512836700", "AffiliationID": "60003302, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Optics and Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56732089500": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "56732089500", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57013633200": {"Name": "Chen D.", "AuthorID": "57013633200", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "57197772732": {"Name": "Zhang Z.", "AuthorID": "57197772732", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}, "16023467700": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "16023467700", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Center of Material Science, National University of Defense Technology"}}}
