Observation: The patient presented at our institution with headache and blurred vision three weeks after a right microkeratome-assisted LASIK procedure. On examination, the visual acuity was hand movements and the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 45 mmHg with fluid in the flap interface, a fixed pupil in moderate mydriasis, iris transillumination and cells in the anterior chamber. A Baerveldt tube implant was necessary to control the IOP. After three months, the corrected visual acuity was 20/40 with normal IOP and an early cataract. Conclusion and importance: To our knowledge this is the first report of a case of combined Urrets-Zavalia syndrome and interface fluid syndrome after LASIK. We speculate that steroid induced ocular hypertension was the primary cause.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interface fluid syndrome", "LASIK", "LASIK complications", "Urrets-Zavalia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058807457", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57191439856": {"Name": "Vasquez-Perez A.", "AuthorID": "57191439856", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and External Disease Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57094732600": {"Name": "Aiello F.", "AuthorID": "57094732600", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome \u201cTor Vergata\u201d"}, "57204281189": {"Name": "Muthusamy K.", "AuthorID": "57204281189", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and External Disease Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004454391": {"Name": "Tuft S.", "AuthorID": "7004454391", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Cornea and External Disease Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
