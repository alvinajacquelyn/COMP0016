Adverse reactions (ADRs) to the treatment are common and often result in treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. Factors contributing to ADRs, including genetic variation, are poorly characterized. We performed exome array analysis to identify genetic variants that contribute to adverse reactions. Our final dataset consisted of 504 European ancestry individuals undergoing fluoropyrimidine-based therapy for gastrointestinal cancer. A subset of 254 of these were treated with Capecitabine. All individuals were genotyped on the Illumina HumanExome Array. Firstly, we performed SNP and gene-level analyses of protein-altering variants on the array to identify novel associations the following ADRs, which were grouped into four phenotypes based on symptoms of diarrhea, mucositis, and neutropenia and hand-and-foot syndrome. Secondly, we performed detailed analyses of the HLA region on the same phenotypes after imputing the HLA alleles and amino acids. No protein-altering variants, or sets of protein-altering variants collapsed into genes, were associated with the main outcomes after Bonferroni correction. We found evidence that the HLA region was enriched for associations with Hand-and-Foot syndrome (p = 0.023), but no specific SNPs or HLA alleles were significant after Bonferroni correction. Larger studies will be required to characterize the genetic contribution to ADRs to 5FU. Future studies that focus on the HLA region are likely to be fruitful.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic", "Biomarkers", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Exome", "Female", "Fluorouracil", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Genotype", "HLA Antigens", "Humans", "Male", "Microarray Analysis", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046359002", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55290620300": {"Name": "Traylor M.", "AuthorID": "55290620300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King\u2019s College London"}, "56108027900": {"Name": "Walker J.L.", "AuthorID": "56108027900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "8964026000": {"Name": "Prescott N.J.", "AuthorID": "8964026000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King\u2019s College London"}, "7004609303": {"Name": "Mathew C.G.", "AuthorID": "7004609303", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Brenner Institute for Molecular Bioscience, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "7402975073": {"Name": "Lewis C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402975073", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "54896320100": {"Name": "Corrigan A.A.", "AuthorID": "54896320100", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Purine Research Laboratory, GSTS Pathology, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, St. Thomas Hospital"}, "35748528400": {"Name": "Hernandez M.A.", "AuthorID": "35748528400", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Purine Research Laboratory, GSTS Pathology, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, St. Thomas Hospital"}, "6701869900": {"Name": "Marinaki A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701869900", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Purine Research Laboratory, GSTS Pathology, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, St. Thomas Hospital"}, "8931613700": {"Name": "Newhouse S.J.", "AuthorID": "8931613700", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and (Institute of Psychiatry), King\u2019s College London"}, "35766461900": {"Name": "Folarin A.A.", "AuthorID": "35766461900", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and (Institute of Psychiatry), King\u2019s College London"}, "57196028662": {"Name": "Patel H.", "AuthorID": "57196028662", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health at South London, Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and (Institute of Psychiatry), King\u2019s College London"}, "7402412841": {"Name": "Ross P.J.", "AuthorID": "7402412841", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London"}, "7202371835": {"Name": "Sanderson J.D.", "AuthorID": "7202371835", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Guy\u2019s and St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London"}, "7103113712": {"Name": "Spicer J.", "AuthorID": "7103113712", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, King\u2019s College London, Guy\u2019s Hospital"}}}
