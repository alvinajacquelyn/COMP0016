We hypothesized that these two seemingly disparate functional roles of the DN are functionally coupled, in line with theories proposing that selfhood is grounded in the neural monitoring of internal organs, such as the heart. We measured with magnetoencepha-lograhy neural responses evoked by heartbeats while human participants freely mind-wandered. When interrupted by a visual stimulus at random intervals, participants scored the self-relatedness of the interrupted thought. They evaluated their involvement as the first-person perspective subject or agent in the thought (\"I \"), and on another scale to what degree they were thinking about themselves (\"Me \"). During the interrupted thought, neural responses to heartbeats in two regions of the DN, the ventral precuneus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, covaried, respectively, with the \"I \" and the \"Me \" dimensions of the self, even at the single-trial level. No covariation between self-relatedness and peripheral autonomic measures (heart rate, heart rate variability, pupil diameter, electrodermal activity, respiration rate, and phase) or alpha power was observed. Our results reveal a direct link between selfhood and neural responses to heartbeats in the DN and thus directly support theories grounding selfhood in the neural monitoring of visceral inputs. More generally, the tight functional coupling between self-related processing and cardiac monitoring observed here implies that, even in the absence of measured changes in peripheral bodily measures, physiological and cognitive functions have to be considered jointly in the DN.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Default network", "Heartbeat-evoked responses", "MEG", "Self", "Spontaneous cognition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attention", "Autonomic Nervous System", "Cognition", "Feedback, Physiological", "Female", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Thinking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979742592", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55515340800": {"Name": "Babo-Rebelo M.", "AuthorID": "55515340800", "AffiliationID": "60105789, 60000179, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Neurosciences Cognitives (ENS-INSERM), D\u00e9partement d\u2019Etudes Cognitives, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure-PSL Research University"}, "20734918600": {"Name": "Richter C.G.", "AuthorID": "20734918600", "AffiliationID": "60104969", "AffiliationName": "Ernst Str\u00fcngmann Institute for Neuroscience in Cooperation, Max Planck Society"}, "6603439699": {"Name": "Tallon-Baudry C.", "AuthorID": "6603439699", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60120341, 60015622, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "Centre de NeuroImagerie de Recherche CENIR, Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, UMR-S975, Inserm U975, CNRS UMR 7225, Groupe Hospitalier Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re"}}}
