Aims Use of in silico methods and pharmacology to investigate the potential for NSAIDs diclofenac, celecoxib and naproxen to bind to nuclear receptors. Materials and methods In silico screening predicted that both diclofenac and celecoxib has the potential to bind to a number of different nuclear receptors; docking analysis confirmed a theoretical ability for diclofenac and celecoxib but not naproxen to bind to TR\u03b2. Key findings Results from TR\u03b2 luciferase reporter assays confirmed that both diclofenac and celecoxib display TR\u03b2 antagonistic properties; celecoxib, IC50 3.6 \u00d7 10-6 M, and diclofenac IC50 5.3 \u00d7 10-6 M, comparable to the TR\u03b2 antagonist MLS (IC50 3.1 \u00d7 10-6 M). In contrast naproxen, a cardio-sparing NSAID, lacked TR\u03b2 antagonist effects. In order to determine the effects of NSAIDs in whole organ in vitro, we used isometric wire myography to measure the changes to Triiodothyronine (T3) induced vasodilation of rat mesenteric arteries. Incubation of arteries in the presence of the TR\u03b2 antagonist MLS000389544 (10-5 M), as well as diclofenac (10-5 M) and celecoxib (10-5 M) but not naproxen significantly inhibited T3 induced vasodilation compared to controls. Significance These results highlight the benefits of computational chemistry methods used to retrospectively analyse well known drugs for side effects. Using in silico and in vitro methods we have shown that both celecoxib and diclofenac but not naproxen exhibit off-target TR\u03b2 antagonist behaviour, which may be linked to their detrimental side effects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Artery", "NSAID", "Thyroid hormone", "Toxicology", "Triiodothyronine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Celecoxib", "Computer Simulation", "Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors", "Diclofenac", "Humans", "Male", "Mesenteric Arteries", "Models, Molecular", "Naproxen", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "Thyroid Hormone Receptors beta", "Triiodothyronine", "Vasodilation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954286207", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"6603596752": {"Name": "Zloh M.", "AuthorID": "6603596752", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57031819000": {"Name": "Perez-Diaz N.", "AuthorID": "57031819000", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57054561100": {"Name": "Tang L.", "AuthorID": "57054561100", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "54407349800": {"Name": "Patel P.", "AuthorID": "54407349800", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "55848844700": {"Name": "Mackenzie L.", "AuthorID": "55848844700", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
