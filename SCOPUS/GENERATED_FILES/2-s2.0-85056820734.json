However, due to their scale, structural and functional complexity and emergent properties, these global spanning Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems are becoming increasingly complex and more difficult for current requirements engineering (RE) practices to handle. In this paper, we firstly introduce SoSE as an emerging discipline and key characteristics of SoSs. We then highlight the challenges that the RE discipline must respond to. We discuss some weaknesses of current RE techniques and approaches to cope with the complexity of SoSs. We then argue that there is a need for the global RE community to evolve current RE approaches and to develop new ways of thinking, new RE capabilities and possibly a new RE science as a key mechanism for addressing requirements engineering complexities posed by Systems of Systems. We then outline a requirements engineering perspective and research agenda that identifies 'top-10' research themes informed by a cluster of four Systems of Systems Engineering projects funded by the European Commission's Horizon 2020 research programme.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyber-physical systems", "Requirements engineering perspective", "Research agenda", "Smart cities", "Systems of systems", "Systems of systems engineering", "The fourth industrial revolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cyber physical systems (CPSs)", "Engineering project", "Functional complexity", "Industrial revolutions", "Integrated transport", "Research agenda", "Research programmes", "Systems of systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056820734", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"6602498672": {"Name": "Ncube C.", "AuthorID": "6602498672", "AffiliationID": "60070792", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and IT, British University in Dubai"}, "27169737500": {"Name": "Lim S.L.", "AuthorID": "27169737500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
