Our knowledge of the distribution of these habitats is largely incomplete, particularly in deeper water and at higher latitudes. The western continental shelf of Greenland is one example of a deep (more than 500 m) Arctic region with limited information available. This study uses an adaptation of the EUNIS seabed classification scheme to document benthic habitats in the region of the West Greenland shrimp trawl fishery from 60\u00b0N to 72\u00b0N in depths of 61\u2013725 m. More than 2000 images collected at 224 stations between 2011 and 2015 were grouped into 7 habitat classes. A classification model was developed using environmental proxies to make habitat predictions for the entire western shelf (200\u2013700 m below 72\u00b0N). The spatial distribution of habitats correlates with temperature and latitude. Muddy sediments appear in northern and colder areas whereas sandy and rocky areas dominate in the south. Southern regions are also warmer and have stronger currents. The Mud habitat is the most widespread, covering around a third of the study area. There is a general pattern that deep channels and basins are dominated by muddy sediments, many of which are fed by glacial sedimentation and outlets from fjords, while shallow banks and shelf have a mix of more complex habitats. This first habitat classification map of the West Greenland shelf will be a useful tool for researchers, management and conservationists.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benthic habitats", "Deep sea", "Habitat modelling", "Sea bed imaging", "Trawling impact", "Vulnerable marine habitats"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011915795", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"]], "AuthorData": {"57193224545": {"Name": "Gougeon S.", "AuthorID": "57193224545", "AffiliationID": "60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology"}, "55217303300": {"Name": "Kemp K.", "AuthorID": "55217303300", "AffiliationID": "60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology"}, "8853289200": {"Name": "Yesson C.", "AuthorID": "8853289200", "AffiliationID": "60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology"}, "18133530800": {"Name": "Blicher M.", "AuthorID": "18133530800", "AffiliationID": "60072871", "AffiliationName": "Greenland Institute of Natural Resources"}}}
