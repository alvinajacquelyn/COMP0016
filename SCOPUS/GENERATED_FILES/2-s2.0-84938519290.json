Despite NR2E1 regulating targets like p21<sup>CIP1</sup> or PTEN we still lack a full explanation for its role in NSC self-renewal and tumorigenesis. We know that polycomb repressive complexes also control stem cell self-renewal and tumorigenesis, but so far, no formal connection has been established between NR2E1 and PRCs. In a screen for transcription factors regulating the expression of the polycomb protein CBX7, we identified NR2E1 as one of its more prominent regulators. NR2E1 binds at the CBX7 promoter, inducing its expression. Notably CBX7 represses NR2E1 as part of a regulatory loop. Ectopic NR2E1 expression inhibits cellular senescence, extending cellular lifespan in fibroblasts via CBX7-mediated regulation of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and direct repression of p21<sup>CIP1</sup>. In addition NR2E1 expression also counteracts oncogene-induced senescence. The importance of NR2E1 to restrain senescence is highlighted through the process of knocking down its expression, which causes premature senescence in human fibroblasts and epithelial cells. We also confirmed that NR2E1 regulates CBX7 and restrains senescence in NSCs. Finally, we observed that the expression of NR2E1 directly correlates with that of CBX7 in human glioblastoma multiforme. Overall we identified control of senescence and regulation of polycomb action as two possible mechanisms that can join those so far invoked to explain the role of NR2E1 in control of NSC self-renewal and cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Aging", "Cells, Cultured", "Feedback, Physiological", "Gene Expression Regulation", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Neural Stem Cells", "Polycomb Repressive Complex 1", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938519290", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"6603068743": {"Name": "O'Loghlen A.", "AuthorID": "6603068743", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Epigenetics and Cellular Senescence Group, Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57206686426": {"Name": "Martin N.", "AuthorID": "57206686426", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Cell Proliferation Group, Epigenetic Section, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "7101703863": {"Name": "Brookes S.", "AuthorID": "7101703863", "AffiliationID": "101221648", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Oncology Laboratory, CRUK, London Research Institute"}, "7201625551": {"Name": "Gil J.", "AuthorID": "7201625551", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Cell Proliferation Group, Epigenetic Section, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "56533637700": {"Name": "Pemberton H.", "AuthorID": "56533637700", "AffiliationID": "101221648", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Oncology Laboratory, CRUK, London Research Institute"}, "55803316600": {"Name": "Chandler H.", "AuthorID": "55803316600", "AffiliationID": "101221648", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Oncology Laboratory, CRUK, London Research Institute"}, "7401522579": {"Name": "Peters G.", "AuthorID": "7401522579", "AffiliationID": "101221648", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Oncology Laboratory, CRUK, London Research Institute"}, "57197009152": {"Name": "Krusche B.", "AuthorID": "57197009152", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Cell Interactions and Cancer Group, Epigenetic Section, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "6602556904": {"Name": "Parrinello S.", "AuthorID": "6602556904", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60006757", "AffiliationName": "Cell Interactions and Cancer Group, Epigenetic Section, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre, Imperial College London"}, "35585886100": {"Name": "Alonso M.", "AuthorID": "35585886100", "AffiliationID": "60020930", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital of Navarra"}}}
