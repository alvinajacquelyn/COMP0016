Background: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy is a major determinant of late mortality in HT recipients. The long-term prognostic value of serial CFR quantification by PET imaging in HT patients is unknown. Methods: A total of 89 patients with history of HT (71% men, 7.0 \u00b1 5.7 years post-HT, age 57 \u00b1 11 years) scheduled for dynamic rest and stress (dipyridamole) 82Rb PET between March 1, 2008 and July 31, 2009 (PET-1) were prospectively enrolled in a single-center study. PET myocardial perfusion studies were reprocessed using U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved software (Corridor 4DM, version 2017) for calculation of CFR. Follow-up PET (PET-2) imaging was performed in 69 patients at 1.9 \u00b1 0.3 years following PET-1. Patients were categorized based on CFR values considering CFR \u22641.5 as low and CFR >1.5 as high CFR. Results: Forty deaths occurred during the median follow-up time of 8.6 years. Low CFR at PET-1 was associated with a 2.77-fold increase in all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34 to 5.74; p = 0.004). CFR decreased over time in patients with follow-up imaging (PET-1: 2.11 \u00b1 0.74 vs. PET-2: 1.81 \u00b1 0.61; p = 0.003). Twenty-five patients were reclassified based on PET-1 and PET-2 (high to low CFR: n = 18, low to high CFR: n = 7). Overall survival was similar in patients reclassified from high to low as patients with low to low CFR, whereas patients reclassified from low to high had similar survival as patients with high to high CFR. In multivariate Cox regression of patients with PET-2, higher baseline CFR (hazard ratio [HR] for a 0.73 unit (one SD) increase: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.82) and reduction in CFR from PET-1 to PET-2 (HR for a 0.79 unit (one SD) decrease: 1.50 to 7.84) were independent predictors of all-cause mortality. Conclusions: Serial assessment of CFR by 82Rb PET independently predicts long-term mortality in HT patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cardiac allograft vasculopathy", "coronary flow reserve", "heart transplantation", "myocardial blood flow", "positron emission tomography", "prognosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Fractional Flow Reserve, Myocardial", "Heart Transplantation", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Perfusion Imaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Reproducibility of Results", "Rubidium Radioisotopes", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055092215", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"36190633500": {"Name": "Feher A.", "AuthorID": "36190633500", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "57213375872": {"Name": "Quail M.A.", "AuthorID": "57213375872", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "55967570200": {"Name": "Boutagy N.E.", "AuthorID": "55967570200", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "55618193000": {"Name": "Wilson L.", "AuthorID": "55618193000", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "7404492750": {"Name": "Miller E.J.", "AuthorID": "7404492750", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "36063491400": {"Name": "Liu Y.H.", "AuthorID": "36063491400", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "7403111346": {"Name": "Lee F.", "AuthorID": "7403111346", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "7006837185": {"Name": "Sinusas A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006837185", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "7403492817": {"Name": "Srivastava A.", "AuthorID": "7403492817", "AffiliationID": "60006656", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Scripps Clinic"}, "57204293367": {"Name": "Khanna P.", "AuthorID": "57204293367", "AffiliationID": "60019358", "AffiliationName": "Rutgers-Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital"}}}
