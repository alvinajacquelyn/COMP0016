All rights reserved.Lowland, shallow, coastal aquatic systems often comprise a complex array of habitats and species as a consequence of their geomorphic evolution in combination with marine and terrestrial forcing. They are vulnerable to changes in climate and human activities that influence hydrology, water quality, sediment dynamics and species assemblages. Conservation-oriented management practices are being implemented at many sites to maintain favourable conservation status, but have the potential to also deliver unforeseen impacts on the hydrological character of these systems and their wider catchments. Sheskinmore Lough, a shallow coastal freshwater lake and wetland system in County Donegal, Ireland, is managed to maintain water levels. In this study, hydrological modelling is undertaken to establish the potential future impacts of climate change and hydrological management on the ecohydrology of the lake and wetland system. Results show that hydrological management has the largest impact on system ecohydrology in comparison to climate change. When combined with climate change, however, these effects are even greater. Given that climate change is predicted to increase the magnitude of these impacts, environmental managers need to consider the array of vulnerable species, their specific ecohydrological requirements, and the overall biodiversity of the site, when developing future conservation management strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change", "Coastal lake", "Conservation", "Ecohydrology", "Freshwater", "Hydrological management"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064764366", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"55711497100": {"Name": "Gardner E.A.", "AuthorID": "55711497100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Geography"}, "10540040600": {"Name": "Burningham H.", "AuthorID": "10540040600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Geography"}, "7405818736": {"Name": "Thompson J.R.", "AuthorID": "7405818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Geography"}}}
