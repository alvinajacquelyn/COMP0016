The \u03b11-adrenoceptor agonist NRL001 (1R,2S-methoxamine hydrochloride) improves anal sphincter tone. NRL001 efficacy was evaluated by changes in Wexner scores at week 4 vs. baseline in NRL001-treated patients compared with placebo. Impact of NRL001 on QoL and safety were also assessed. Methods: Four hundred sixty-six patients received NRL001 (5, 7.5 or 10 mg) or placebo as suppository, once daily over 8 weeks. Wexner score, Vaizey score and QoL were analysed at baseline, week 4 and week 8. FI episodes and adverse events were recorded in diaries. Results: At week 4, mean reductions in Wexner scores were \u22123.0, \u22122.6, \u22122.6 and \u22122.4 for NRL001 5, 7.5, 10 mg and placebo, respectively. All reduced further by week 8. As placebo responses also improved, there was no significant treatment effect at week 4 (p = 0.6867) or week 8 (p = 0.5005). FI episode frequency improved for all patients, but not significantly compared with placebo (week 4: p = 0.2619, week 8: p = 0.5278). All patients\u2019 QoL improved, but not significantly for all parameters (p > 0.05) except depression/self-perception at week 4 (p = 0.0102) and week 8 (p = 0.0069), compared with placebo. Most adverse events were mild and judged probably or possibly related to NRL001. Conclusions: All groups demonstrated improvement in efficacy and QoL compared with baseline. NRL001 was well-tolerated without serious safety concerns. Despite the improvement in all groups, there was no statistically significant treatment effect, underlining the importance of relating results to a placebo arm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha-1 receptor agonist", "Episode frequency", "Faecal incontinence", "NRL001", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Demography", "Fecal Incontinence", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Methoxamine", "Middle Aged", "Patient Satisfaction", "Placebos", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963665546", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"7004926457": {"Name": "Siproudhis L.", "AuthorID": "7004926457", "AffiliationID": "60026968", "AffiliationName": "CHU Pontchaillou"}, "7202423603": {"Name": "Graf W.", "AuthorID": "7202423603", "AffiliationID": "60015216, 60003858", "AffiliationName": "Institution of Surgical Sciences, Akademiska Sjukhuset, Uppsala University"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "56339700500": {"Name": "Walker D.", "AuthorID": "56339700500", "AffiliationID": "100585205", "AffiliationName": "Norgine Ltd"}, "56026904000": {"Name": "Shing R.N.K.", "AuthorID": "56026904000", "AffiliationID": "100585205", "AffiliationName": "Norgine Ltd"}, "55769579000": {"Name": "Pediconi C.", "AuthorID": "55769579000", "AffiliationID": "100585205", "AffiliationName": "Norgine Ltd"}, "57188830686": {"Name": "Pilot J.", "AuthorID": "57188830686", "AffiliationID": "100585205", "AffiliationName": "Norgine Ltd"}, "55664955900": {"Name": "Wexner S.", "AuthorID": "55664955900", "AffiliationID": "60029770", "AffiliationName": "Cleveland Clinic Florida"}, "35809675700": {"Name": "Scholefield J.", "AuthorID": "35809675700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, University Hospital Nottingham"}}}
