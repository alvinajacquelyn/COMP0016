We compute the family Gromov-Witten invariants which count pseudoholomorphic tori in the Kodaira-Thurston manifold. For a fixed symplectic form the Gromov-Witten invariant is trivial so we consider the twistor family of left-invariant symplectic forms which are orthogonal for some fixed metric on the Lie algebra. This family defines a loop in the space of symplectic forms. This is the first example of a genus one family Gromov-Witten computation for a non-K\u00e4hler manifold.", "AuthorKeywords": ["family Gromov-Witten invariant", "Kodaira-Thurston", "nilpotent Lie group", "non-K\u00e4hler", "pseudoholomorphic curve"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937060565", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"]], "AuthorData": {"57197523215": {"Name": "Evans J.", "AuthorID": "57197523215", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6602804261": {"Name": "K\u0119dra J.", "AuthorID": "6602804261", "AffiliationID": "60031813", "AffiliationName": "University of Szczecin"}}}
