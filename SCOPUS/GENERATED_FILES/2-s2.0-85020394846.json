This anisotropy may significantly influence the cells' mechanotransductive response to complex loads, and has important implications for development of accurate models of tissue biomechanics. Standard methods for measuring cellular mechanics report linear moduli that cannot capture large-deformation anisotropic properties, which in a continuum mechanics framework are best described by a strain energy density function (SED). In tissues, the SED is most robustly measured using biaxial testing. Here, we describe a cellular microbiaxial stretching (ClBS) method that modifies this tissue-scale approach to measure the anisotropic elastic behavior of individual vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) with nativelike cytoarchitecture. Using ClBS, we reveal that VSMCs are highly anisotropic under large deformations. We then characterize a Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden type SED for individual VSMCs and find that architecture-dependent properties of the cells can be robustly described using a formulation solely based on the organization of their actin cytoskeleton. These results suggest that cellular anisotropy should be considered when developing biomechanical models, and could play an important role in cellular mechano-adaptation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anisotropic elastic", "Anisotropic property", "Bio-mechanical models", "Mechanical stimulus", "Strain energy density functions", "Structural organization", "Tissue biomechanics", "Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells", "Actin Cytoskeleton", "Anisotropy", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Humans", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Single-Cell Analysis", "Stress, Mechanical", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020394846", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55876799800": {"Name": "Win Z.", "AuthorID": "55876799800", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities"}, "57194494339": {"Name": "Buksa J.", "AuthorID": "57194494339", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities"}, "56050597700": {"Name": "Steucke K.", "AuthorID": "56050597700", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities"}, "7003600870": {"Name": "Barocas V.", "AuthorID": "7003600870", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities"}, "8066360200": {"Name": "Alford P.", "AuthorID": "8066360200", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities"}, "42861545600": {"Name": "Gant Luxton G.", "AuthorID": "42861545600", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities"}}}
