Up to date, most of the demonstrated NFDM schemes have employed only single polarization for data transmission. Employing both polarizations can potentially double the data rate of NFDM systems. We investigate in simulation a dual-polarization NFDM transmission with data modulation on the b-coefficient. First, a transformation that facilitates the dual-polarization b-modulation was built upon an existing transformation in [M. Yousefi and X. Yangzhang, 'Linear and nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing,' in Proc. Eur. Conf. Opt. Commun., D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, Sep. 2016, pp. 342-344]. Second, the qc- and b-modulation for dual polarization were compared in terms of Q-factor, spectral efficiency (SE), and correlation of sub-carriers. The correlation is quantified via information theoretic metrics, joint and individual entropy. The polarization-multiplexed b-modulation system shows 1-dB Q-factor improvement over qc-modulation system due to a weaker correlation of sub-carriers and less effective noise. Finally, the b-modulation system was optimized for high data rate, achieving a record net data rate of 400 Gb/s (SE of 7.2 b/s/Hz) over 12\u00d7 80 km of standard single-mode fiber with erbium-doped fiber amplifiers. Based on the aforementioned simulation results, we further point out the drawbacks of our current system and quantify the error introduced by the transceiver algorithms and non-integrability of the channel", "AuthorKeywords": ["Non-linear Fourier transform", "non-linear frequency-division multiplexing", "optical fibre communication", "wavelength-division multiplexing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Information-theoretic metrics", "Non linear", "Nonlinear frequency", "Q-factor improvement", "Single polarization", "Spectral efficiencies", "Standard single mode fibers", "Transmission schemes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063942705", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57194379345": {"Name": "Yangzhang X.", "AuthorID": "57194379345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "57110068500": {"Name": "Lavery D.", "AuthorID": "57110068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "30867529700": {"Name": "Aref V.", "AuthorID": "30867529700", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "36160408500": {"Name": "Le S.T.", "AuthorID": "36160408500", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "57216639276": {"Name": "Buelow H.", "AuthorID": "57216639276", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}}}
