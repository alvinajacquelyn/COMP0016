Areas covered: The authors review publications from their own laboratory and published recently where identified CHD risk SNPs are used in combination, and \u2018scaled\u2019 by their effect size, to create a \u2018weighted\u2019 Genetic risk Score (GRS), which, in combination with an individual\u2019s classical CHD risk factors, can be used to identify those at overall low, intermediate and high future risk. Those at highest risk can be offered life-style and therapeutic options to reduce their risk and those at intermediate levels can be monitored. Expert commentary: The authors discuss the selection of the best variants to be included in the GRS, and the potential utility of such scores in different clinical settings. The limitations of the current data sets and the way forward in the next 5 years is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["algorithm", "classical risk factors", "coronary heart disease", "genetic risk score", "Genome wide association studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coronary Disease", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genetic Testing", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Leupeptins", "Medication Adherence", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Primary Prevention", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029476150", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56584579500": {"Name": "Beaney K.", "AuthorID": "56584579500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, BHF Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57205556096": {"Name": "Drenos F.", "AuthorID": "57205556096", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, BHF Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
