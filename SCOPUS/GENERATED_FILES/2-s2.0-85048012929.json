The experimental and theoretical evidences are provided for the existence of intrinsic deep electron and hole trap states stemming from the disorder of amorphous metal oxide networks. We start from presenting the results for amorphous (a) HfO2, chosen due to the availability of highest purity amorphous films, which is vital for studying their intrinsic electronic properties. Exhaustive photo-depopulation spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations using density functional theory shed light on the atomic nature of electronic gap states responsible for deep electron trapping observed in a-HfO2. We review theoretical methods used for creating models of amorphous structures and electronic structure calculations of amorphous oxides and outline some of the challenges in modeling defects in amorphous materials. We then discuss theoretical models of electron polarons and bi-polarons in a-HfO2 and demonstrate that these intrinsic states originate from low-coordinated ions and elongated metal-oxygen bonds in the amorphous oxide network. Similarly, holes can be captured at under-coordinated O sites. We then discuss electron and hole trapping in other amorphous oxides, such as a-SiO2, a-Al2O3, a-TiO2. We propose that the presence of low-coordinated ions in amorphous oxides with electron states of significant p and d character near the conduction band minimum can lead to electron trapping and that deep hole trapping should be common to all amorphous oxides. Finally, we demonstrate that bi-electron trapping in a-HfO2 and a-SiO2 weakens Hf(Si)-O bonds and significantly reduces barriers for forming Frenkel defects, neutral O vacancies and O2- ions in these materials. These results should be useful for better understanding of electronic properties and structural evolution of thin amorphous films under carrier injection conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ab initio calculations", "amorphous oxides", "charge trapping", "Frenkel defects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Amorphous oxides", "Conduction-band minimum", "Electron and hole traps", "Electronic structure calculations", "Frenkel defects", "Spectroscopy measurements", "Theoretical calculations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048012929", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57189627614": {"Name": "Strand J.", "AuthorID": "57189627614", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University College London"}, "55313204300": {"Name": "Gao D.", "AuthorID": "55313204300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University College London"}, "55662570700": {"Name": "El-Sayed A.M.", "AuthorID": "55662570700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University College London"}, "7007118546": {"Name": "Shluger A.L.", "AuthorID": "7007118546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55597412200": {"Name": "Kaviani M.", "AuthorID": "55597412200", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "WPI-Advanced Institute for Materials Research, Tohoku University"}, "7202887446": {"Name": "Afanas'Ev V.V.", "AuthorID": "7202887446", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Leuven"}}}
