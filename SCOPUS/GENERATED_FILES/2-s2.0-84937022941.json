Copyright \u00a9 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Objective Dementia is a common clinical presentation among older adults with Down syndrome. The presentation of dementia in Down syndrome differs compared with typical Alzheimer's disease. The performance of manualised dementia criteria in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) is uncertain in this population.We aimed to determine the concurrent validity and reliability of clinicians' diagnoses of dementia against ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR diagnoses. Validity of clinical diagnoses were also explored by establishing the stability of diagnoses over time. Methods We used clinical data from memory assessments of 85 people with Down syndrome, of whom 64 (75.3%) had a diagnosis of dementia. The cases of dementia were presented to expert raters who rated the case as dementia or no dementia using ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR criteria and their own clinical judgement. Results We found that clinician's judgement corresponded best with clinically diagnosed cases of dementia, identifying 84.4% cases of clinically diagnosed dementia at the time of diagnosis. ICD-10 criteria identified 70.3% cases, and DSM-IV-TR criteria identified 56.3% cases at the time of clinically diagnosed dementia. Over time, the proportion of cases meeting ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR diagnoses increased, suggesting that experienced clinicians used their clinical knowledge of dementia presentation in Down syndrome to diagnose the disorder at an earlier stage than would have been possible had they relied on the classic description contained in the diagnostic systems. Conclusions Clinical diagnosis of dementia in Down syndrome is valid and reliable and can be used as the standard against which new criteria such as the DSM-5 are measured.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical judgement", "dementia", "diagnosis", "Down syndrome", "DSM-IV-TR", "ICD-10"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Dementia", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "International Classification of Diseases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Observer Variation", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937022941", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55749264700": {"Name": "Sheehan R.", "AuthorID": "55749264700", "AffiliationID": "100451729", "AffiliationName": "Camden Learning Disabilities Service"}, "35192349200": {"Name": "Sinai A.", "AuthorID": "35192349200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "57198123299": {"Name": "Bass N.", "AuthorID": "57198123299", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "6602795544": {"Name": "Courtenay K.", "AuthorID": "6602795544", "AffiliationID": "109482365", "AffiliationName": "Haringey Learning Disabilities Partnership"}, "6701753786": {"Name": "Hassiotis A.", "AuthorID": "6701753786", "AffiliationID": "100451729", "AffiliationName": "Camden Learning Disabilities Service"}, "36830984200": {"Name": "Walker Z.", "AuthorID": "36830984200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, University College London"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "100814518", "AffiliationName": "Islington Learning Disabilities Partnership"}, "56528145000": {"Name": "Blatchford P.", "AuthorID": "56528145000", "AffiliationID": "100423854", "AffiliationName": "Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Learning Disabilities Service"}, "26667199800": {"Name": "Perez-Achiaga N.", "AuthorID": "26667199800", "AffiliationID": "100423854", "AffiliationName": "Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Learning Disabilities Service"}, "55260803400": {"Name": "Bohnen I.", "AuthorID": "55260803400", "AffiliationID": "60162114", "AffiliationName": "Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, Westminster Learning Disability Partnership"}, "48060961600": {"Name": "Bonell S.", "AuthorID": "48060961600", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Maudsley Hospital"}, "6508301275": {"Name": "Markar T.", "AuthorID": "6508301275", "AffiliationID": "60170490, 60027616", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Lister Hospital"}, "56111038300": {"Name": "Mukherji K.", "AuthorID": "56111038300", "AffiliationID": "60170490, 60027616", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Lister Hospital"}, "57200265354": {"Name": "McCarthy J.", "AuthorID": "57200265354", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences (FANS), Institute OfPsychiatry"}, "7004232540": {"Name": "Naeem A.", "AuthorID": "7004232540", "AffiliationID": "125031397", "AffiliationName": "Sutton and Merton Mental Health Learning Disability Team, Jubilee Health Centre East"}, "8947079200": {"Name": "Paschos D.", "AuthorID": "8947079200", "AffiliationID": "100814518", "AffiliationName": "Islington Learning Disabilities Partnership"}, "56527594600": {"Name": "Sharma V.", "AuthorID": "56527594600", "AffiliationID": "60170490", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Community Support Unit"}, "57207809760": {"Name": "Thomas D.", "AuthorID": "57207809760", "AffiliationID": "105606475", "AffiliationName": "Hackney Learning Disabilities Team, Hackney Service Centre"}}}
