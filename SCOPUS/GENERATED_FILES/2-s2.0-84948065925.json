Somatosensory manipulations have also been shown to sometimes decrease tinnitus perception. An ear-massaging device, the Reltus (www.reltus.com), has been marketed as a tinnitus treatment device. This study was undertaken to evaluate its short-term effectiveness and mode of effect. Design: The research was undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 measured the change in tinnitus perception after one minute of auditory stimulation through headphones and after application of a vibrating device to four different stimulation points around the pinna for one minute each. Phase 2 evaluated if it was the vibrations that were responsible for the effect on tinnitus perception, or sound produced by the vibrator. Study sample: Twenty-three participants completed phase 1 and 10 participants participated in the second phase. Results: RI to auditory stimulation was found in 87% of participants and to tactile stimulation in 83%. No significant differences were found in the effectiveness between the four vibration stimulation points, or between the left and right ear of the participants. The Reltus produced a sound that resulted in RI. Conclusions: It is the auditory artifact of the Reltus that was responsible for short-term tinnitus suppression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["residual inhibition", "Tinnitus", "treatment", "vibration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Massage", "Middle Aged", "Perceptual Masking", "Sound", "Tinnitus", "Treatment Outcome", "Vibration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948065925", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"56921469900": {"Name": "Jonsson J.", "AuthorID": "56921469900", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "54890102600": {"Name": "Bohman A.", "AuthorID": "54890102600", "AffiliationID": "60009358", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Link\u00f6ping University"}, "56087344000": {"Name": "Shekhawat G.", "AuthorID": "56087344000", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain Research and Audiology Section, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "55826996400": {"Name": "Kobayashi K.", "AuthorID": "55826996400", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain Research and Audiology Section, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}, "6506808384": {"Name": "Searchfield G.", "AuthorID": "6506808384", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain Research and Audiology Section, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland"}}}
