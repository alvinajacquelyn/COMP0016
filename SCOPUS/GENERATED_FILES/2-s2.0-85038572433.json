This is extremely promising for a number of applications. However, the lack of ability to vary the field limits the potential use of this technology. In this work, this limitation is circumvented using multi-frequency acoustic kinoforms for which different acoustic fields are encoded onto different driving frequencies. An optimisation approach based on random downhill binary search is introduced for the design of the multi-frequency kinoforms. This is applied to two test cases to demonstrate the technique: a kinoform designed to generate the numerals \"1,\" \"2,\" and \"3\" in the same plane but at different driving frequencies, and a kinoform designed to generate 3 sets of eight foci lying on a circle with a driving-frequency-dependent radius. Field measurements from these samples confirmed that multi-frequency acoustic kinoforms can be designed that switch between different arbitrary, pre-designed, acoustic field patterns in the target plane by changing the driving frequency.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic field patterns", "Binary search", "Diffraction limited", "Driving frequencies", "Field measurement", "Multi frequency", "Optimisations", "Single element transducers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038572433", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"57197409265": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "57197409265", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "16200175900": {"Name": "Treeby B.", "AuthorID": "16200175900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
