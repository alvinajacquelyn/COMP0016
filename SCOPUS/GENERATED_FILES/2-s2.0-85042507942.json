A. McGregor and Guerard W. Byrne.Cardiac xenotransplantation (CXTx) is a promising solution to the chronic shortage of donor hearts. Recent advancements in immune suppression have greatly improved the survival of heterotopic CXTx, now extended beyond 2 years, and life-supporting kidney XTx. Advances in donor genetic modification (B4GALNT2 and CMAH mutations) with proven Gal-deficient donors expressing human complement regulatory protein(s) have also accelerated, reducing donor pig organ antigenicity. These advances can now be combined and tested in life-supporting orthotopic preclinical studies in nonhuman primates and immunologically appropriate models confirming their efficacy and safety for a clinical CXTx program. Preclinical studies should also allow for organ rejection to develop xenospecific assays and therapies to reverse rejection. The complexity of future clinical CXTx presents a substantial and unique set of regulatory challenges which must be addressed to avoid delay; however, dependent on these prospective life-supporting preclinical studies in NHPs, it appears that the scientific path forward is well defined and the era of clinical CXTx is approaching.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Communicable Disease Control", "Communicable Diseases", "Genetic Therapy", "Government Regulation", "Heart Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunosuppression", "Mixed Function Oxygenases", "N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases", "Postoperative Complications", "Primates", "Swine", "Tissue Donors", "Transplantation, Heterologous"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042507942", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"35394153900": {"Name": "McGregor C.", "AuthorID": "35394153900", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic"}, "7101906273": {"Name": "Byrne G.", "AuthorID": "7101906273", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic"}}}
