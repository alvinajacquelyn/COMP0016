As a result, constructing such a training dataset involves selecting a set of candidate queries for labelling. In this work, we investigate query selection strategies for learning to rank aimed at actively selecting unlabelled queries to be labelled so as to minimize the data annotation cost. In particular, we characterize query selection based on two aspects of informativeness and representativeness and propose two novel query selection strategies (i) Permutation Probability based query selection and (ii) Topic Model based query selection which capture the two aspects, respectively. We further argue that an ideal query selection strategy should take into account both these aspects and as our final contribution, we present a submodular objective that couples both these aspects while selecting query subsets. We evaluate the quality of the proposed strategies on three real world learning to rank datasets and show that the proposed query selection methods results in significant performance gains compared to the existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active learning", "Learning to rank", "Query selection", "Submodularity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active Learning", "Learning to rank", "Query selection", "Real-world learning", "Relevance judgement", "State-of-the-art approach", "Submodular functions", "Submodularity"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953776565", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"55522733300": {"Name": "Mehrotra R.", "AuthorID": "55522733300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College"}, "57203056765": {"Name": "Yilmaz E.", "AuthorID": "57203056765", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Computer Science, University College"}}}
