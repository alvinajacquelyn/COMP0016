We extend our techniques to a class of bivariate time series that are isotropic. Exact inference is often not computationally viable for time series analysis, and so we propose an estimation method based on the Whittle likelihood, a commonly adopted pseudo-likelihood. Our inference procedure is shown to be consistent under standard assumptions, as well as having considerably lower computational cost than exact likelihood in general. We show the utility of this framework for the analysis of drifting instruments, an analysis that is key to characterizing global ocean circulation and therefore also for decadal to century-scale climate understanding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["missing data", "Modulation", "non-stationary", "periodogram", "surface drifters", "Whittle likelihood"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026307003", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"57195218873": {"Name": "Guillaumin A.", "AuthorID": "57195218873", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6507545514": {"Name": "Olhede S.", "AuthorID": "6507545514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "36447846900": {"Name": "Sykulski A.", "AuthorID": "36447846900", "AffiliationID": "60117771, 60117616, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Data Science Institute and Department of Mathematics & Statistics, Lancaster University"}, "57189059791": {"Name": "Early J.", "AuthorID": "57189059791", "AffiliationID": "60016155", "AffiliationName": "NorthWest Research Associates"}, "8790086900": {"Name": "Lilly J.", "AuthorID": "8790086900", "AffiliationID": "60016155", "AffiliationName": "NorthWest Research Associates"}}}
