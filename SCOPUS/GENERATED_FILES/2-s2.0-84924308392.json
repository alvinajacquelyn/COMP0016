Addition of a second electron affords the 64-electron cluster [Fe4(CO)10(\u03ba2-dppn)(\u03bc4-O)]2- (12-) which has more limited stability but is stable within the time frame of the electrochemical experiment. While 1 and 1- are inactive as proton reduction catalysts, dianionic 12- is active for the formation of hydrogen from both CHCl2CO2H and CF3CO2H. This occurs via two separate mechanistic cycles branching at the mono-protonated species [Fe4(CO)10(\u03ba2-dppn)(\u03bc4-O)H]- (1H-) resulting from the rapid protonation of 12-. This intermediate then undergoes competing protonation and reduction events leading to EECC and ECEC catalytic cycles respectively with 1- being pivotal to both. In order to understand the nature of [Fe4(CO)10(\u03ba2-dppn)(\u03bc4-O)]2- (12-) and its protonated products density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed. Theoretical calculations reveal that the cluster core remains intact in 12-, but the two consecutive one-electron reductions lead to an expansion of one of the trigonal-pyramids of this trigonal-bipyramidal cluster. The two-electron reduced cluster 12- protonates at dppn-bound iron, accompanied by a wingtip-hinge iron-iron bond scission, and then reacts with a second proton to evolve hydrogen.
