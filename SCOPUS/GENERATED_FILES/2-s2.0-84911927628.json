All rights reserved.The production of \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 mesons in photon- and hadron-induced reactions on free and quasi-free nucleons and on nuclei is reviewed. The extensive database on \u03b3N\u2192\u03b7N, for both proton and neutron targets, is described in detail and its implications for the search for N resonances much heavier than the dominant S11(1535) discussed. Though less is currently known about the production of the \u03b7\u2032 or of \u03b7\u03c0 pairs, these also offer tantalizing prospects in the search for the missing isobars. The more limited data available on pion-induced production are still necessary ingredients in the partial wave analysis discussed. The production of the \u03b7-meson in pp and pn collisions shows once again the strong influence of the S11(1535) isobar, which is in contrast to the relatively weak behaviour seen near threshold for \u03b7\u2032 production. This difference is reflected in the important final state interaction effects of the \u03b7 in nuclei that may even lead to this meson being \"bound\" in some systems. The evidence for this is reviewed for both \u03b3A and pA collisions. The inclusive photoproduction of \u03b7, \u03b7\u2032, and \u03b7\u03c0 pairs from nuclei provides further information regarding the production mechanism and the interaction of the \u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 with nuclei and the \u03b7\u03c0 pairs may even allow access to low mass \u03b7A systems that are forbidden in direct single-meson photoproduction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hadroproduction", "Photoproduction", "\u03b7 and \u03b7\u2032 mesons"], "IndexKeywords": ["Final state interactions", "Hadroproduction", "Meson photoproduction", "Near thresholds", "Partial wave analysis", "Photoproductions", "Production mechanisms", "Proton and neutron"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911927628", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"6701560287": {"Name": "Krusche B.", "AuthorID": "6701560287", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Basel"}, "7003313816": {"Name": "Wilkin C.", "AuthorID": "7003313816", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physics and Astronomy Department, UCL"}}}
