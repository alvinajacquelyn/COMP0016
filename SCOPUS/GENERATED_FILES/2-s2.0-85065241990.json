Initially, the directly-injected DME and in-cylinder premixed methane-air mixture are partially mixed to form a mixing layer in between. A reduced DME/CH4 oxidization mechanism, consisting of 25 species and 147 reaction steps, is developed and validated. Ignition is found to occur as a two-stage process. Low-temperature autoignition is first initiated in the fuel-rich part of the mixture and then transits to a cool flame, propagating towards the even richer mixture through a balanced reaction-diffusion mechanism. Cool flames not only develop in the mixing layer, but also in the initially stratified DME/methane-air mixture. The formation of high-temperature autoignition kernels is earlier than that in the homogeneous mixture at the same mixture fraction, which is thought to be accelerated by the cool flame. The expanding flames from high-temperature kernels are connected with the neighboring flames before they engulf the stoichiometric mixture iso-lines. The four branches of typical tetrabranchial flames, i.e. cool flame, fuel-rich premixed flame, diffusion flame, fuel-lean premixed flame coexist in the field. The fuel-lean premixed flame branch finally triggers the premixed methane-air flame. The multi-stage and multi-mode nature of the ignition process highlights the intractable challenge to model the RCCI engine combustion.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cool flame", "DME", "DNS", "Ignition", "RCCI", "Tetrabranchial flame"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cool flame", "Homogeneous mixtures", "Oxidization mechanism", "Premixed methane-air flames", "RCCI", "Reaction-diffusion mechanisms", "Stoichiometric mixtures", "Tetrabranchial flame"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065241990", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"54585250100": {"Name": "Jin T.", "AuthorID": "54585250100", "AffiliationID": "60117972, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University"}, "57197770546": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57197770546", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "23393003000": {"Name": "Luo K.", "AuthorID": "23393003000", "AffiliationID": "60117972, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University"}, "57216429726": {"Name": "Fan J.", "AuthorID": "57216429726", "AffiliationID": "60117972, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Clean Energy Utilization, Zhejiang University"}, "56093621700": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "56093621700", "AffiliationID": "60022659", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Connecticut"}, "7402684692": {"Name": "Lu T.", "AuthorID": "7402684692", "AffiliationID": "60022659", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Connecticut"}}}
