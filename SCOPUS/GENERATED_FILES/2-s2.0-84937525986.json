These equilibria involve a run on the central bank[U+05F3]s interest target, whereby money grows fast, private agents borrow as much as possible against the central bank, and the shadow interest rate is different from the policy target. We argue that these equilibria represent a particular danger when banks hold large excess reserves, such as is the case following periods of quantitative easing. Our analysis suggests that successfully managing the exit strategy requires additional tools beyond setting interest-rate targets and paying interest on reserves; in particular, freezing excess reserves or fiscal-policy intervention may be needed to fend off adverse expectations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inflation", "Interest rate rule", "Quantitative easing", "Run"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937525986", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"6603968952": {"Name": "Bassetto M.", "AuthorID": "6603968952", "AffiliationID": "60012327", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Fiscal Studies"}, "7003490781": {"Name": "Phelan C.", "AuthorID": "7003490781", "AffiliationID": "60020337", "AffiliationName": "National Bureau of Economic Research"}}}
