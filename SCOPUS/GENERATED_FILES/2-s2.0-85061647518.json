As photovoltaics have grown to become one of the dominant renewable energy generating technologies, attention has fallen upon thin-film materials as a route to lightweight, flexible and portable solar cells. NaSbS 2 has recently been proposed as a non-toxic, earth abundant solar absorber for thin-film cells. In this study, we use a combined theoretical and experimental approach to characterize and assess the electronic and optical properties of NaSbS 2 as an emerging solar absorber. Our results, utilising two theoretical efficiency metrics, demonstrate that NaSbS 2 may be limited for use in single-junction cells by a forbidden band gap and slow absorption onset. Other features of its electronic structure, however, indicate that the material may still be promising in thermoelectric applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Efficiency metrics", "Electronic and optical properties", "Experimental approaches", "Portable solar cells", "Renewable energies", "Single-junction cells", "Thermoelectric application", "Thin film material"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061647518", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57206238467": {"Name": "Leung W.W.W.", "AuthorID": "57206238467", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "56545348200": {"Name": "Savory C.N.", "AuthorID": "56545348200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, University College London"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.G.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Harwell XPS, Room G.63, Research Complex at Harwell"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
