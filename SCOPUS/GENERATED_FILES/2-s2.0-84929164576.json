Data refer to 211 landing episodes attributed to four main gears. Results show that elasmobranchs can constitute up to 10% of total capture. Five orders are identified and catch-per-unit-effort peaks for large-hook long-lines. The presence of both adult and neonate elasmobranch catch suggests fishing may occur inside nursery habitat.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bijag\u00f3s", "Elasmobranchs", "Small-scale fishing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929164576", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"]], "AuthorData": {"56372558600": {"Name": "Cross H.", "AuthorID": "56372558600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
