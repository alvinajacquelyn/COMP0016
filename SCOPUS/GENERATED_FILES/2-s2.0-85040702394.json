However, the long-term efficacy of RIST and its curative potential have not been clearly demonstrated. We studied the long-term outcome of patients receiving a RIST for MCL as reported to the EBMT. A total of 324 patients, median age 57 years (range 31-70), underwent a RIST between 2000 and 2008; 43% of the patients had received >3 lines of prior therapy, including an autoSCT in 46%. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 10% at 100 days and 24% at 1 year and was lower for patients receiving anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)/ALG (RR 0.59, p = 0.046). After a median follow-up of 72 months (range 3-159), 118 patients relapsed at a median of 8 months post RIST (range 1-117). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 25% and 40% at 1 and 5 years, respectively, and was associated with chemorefractory disease (HR 0.49, p = 0.01) and the use of CAMPATH (HR 2.59, p = 0.0002). The 4-year progression-free survival rate and overall survival rate was 31 and 40%, respectively. RIST results in long-term disease-free survival in about 30% of the patients, including those patients relapsing after a prior autoSCT.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell", "Middle Aged", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Analysis", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040702394", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"8903082900": {"Name": "Robinson S.P.", "AuthorID": "8903082900", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Bristol"}, "6506480736": {"Name": "Boumendil A.", "AuthorID": "6506480736", "AffiliationID": "113670057", "AffiliationName": "Lymphoma Working Party EBMT"}, "55752409600": {"Name": "Finel H.", "AuthorID": "55752409600", "AffiliationID": "113670057", "AffiliationName": "Lymphoma Working Party EBMT"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.S.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "8634738200": {"Name": "Chevallier P.", "AuthorID": "8634738200", "AffiliationID": "60028048", "AffiliationName": "CHU"}, "7102319569": {"Name": "Sierra J.", "AuthorID": "7102319569", "AffiliationID": "60009466", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau"}, "55636592100": {"Name": "Finke J.", "AuthorID": "55636592100", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "University of Freiburg"}, "16426598100": {"Name": "Poir\u00e9 X.", "AuthorID": "16426598100", "AffiliationID": "60012936", "AffiliationName": "Cliniques Universitaires St. Luc"}, "27172059900": {"Name": "Maillard N.", "AuthorID": "27172059900", "AffiliationID": "60020859", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital la Miletrie"}, "25934803100": {"Name": "Milpied N.", "AuthorID": "25934803100", "AffiliationID": "60021564", "AffiliationName": "CHU Bordeaux"}, "56350354100": {"Name": "Yakoub-Agha I.", "AuthorID": "56350354100", "AffiliationID": "60017724", "AffiliationName": "H\u00f4pital Huriez"}, "7103400013": {"Name": "Koh M.", "AuthorID": "7103400013", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "St. George's Hospital"}, "7007083433": {"Name": "Kr\u00f6ger N.", "AuthorID": "7007083433", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Eppendorf"}, "7103058110": {"Name": "Nagler A.", "AuthorID": "7103058110", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer"}, "7003300703": {"Name": "Koc Y.", "AuthorID": "7003300703", "AffiliationID": "107293381", "AffiliationName": "Medical Park Hospitals"}, "8914656400": {"Name": "Dietrich S.", "AuthorID": "8914656400", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "University of Heidelberg"}, "7005293399": {"Name": "Dreger P.", "AuthorID": "7005293399", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "University of Heidelberg"}, "8341482100": {"Name": "Montoto S.", "AuthorID": "8341482100", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}}}
