In this paper, we aim to provide an update on the latest research regarding the conceptual structure and measurement of PTSD and CPTSD using the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) as per ICD-11 proposals in the USA, UK, Germany and Lithuania. Preliminary findings suggest that CPTSD is common in clinical and population samples, although there may be variations across countries in prevalence rates. In clinical samples, preliminary evidence suggests that CPTSD is a more commonly observed condition than PTSD. Preliminary evidence also suggests that the ITQ scores are reliable and valid and can adequately distinguish between PTSD and CPTSD. Further cross-cultural work is proposed to explore differences in PTSD and CPTSD across different countries with regard to prevalence, incidence, and predictors of PTSD and CPTSD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CPTSD", "ICD-11", "ITQ", "Prevalence", "PTSD"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053549705", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"16425957200": {"Name": "Karatzias T.", "AuthorID": "16425957200", "AffiliationID": "60004120", "AffiliationName": "NHS Lothian, Rivers Centre for Traumatic Stress"}, "35420810100": {"Name": "Cloitre M.", "AuthorID": "35420810100", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "National Center for PTSD, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System"}, "56059359000": {"Name": "Maercker A.", "AuthorID": "56059359000", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Psychopathology and Clinical Interventions, University of Zurich"}, "26121273900": {"Name": "Kazlauskas E.", "AuthorID": "26121273900", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical & Organizational Psychology, Vilnius University"}, "7004128606": {"Name": "Shevlin M.", "AuthorID": "7004128606", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Ulster University"}, "57216048379": {"Name": "Hyland P.", "AuthorID": "57216048379", "AffiliationID": "60104048", "AffiliationName": "School of Business, National College of Ireland"}, "24780669300": {"Name": "Bisson J.I.", "AuthorID": "24780669300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "15849417400": {"Name": "Roberts N.P.", "AuthorID": "15849417400", "AffiliationID": "60138351", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical, Education & Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
