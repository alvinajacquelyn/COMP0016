We conducted this study to identify currently available tests, estimate their diagnostic performance and then exemplify how these could be utilized in clinical practice. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify all primary studies that reported accuracy using oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) as the gold standard. Sources searched included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and The Cochrane Library databases. Results: Twenty-one studies with a total of 2471 patients were identified. Several tests were evaluated in more than three studies. Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (PSR) had the highest summary area under the curve for detection of any size OV of 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.78\u20130.92). At a cut-off of 909 (n = 4 studies) and prevalence rates of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% for OV, PSR screening correctly avoided the need for OGD in 70, 62, 55, 47 and 39% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: PSR appears to be the most accurate and validated non-invasive screening test for OV in patients with compensated cirrhosis. At a cut-off of 909, PSR could be clinically useful to avoid OGDs in a significant proportion of patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnosis; non-invasive markers; platelet to spleen ratio; liver stiffness measurement"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044597443", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"55912766000": {"Name": "Sami S.S.", "AuthorID": "55912766000", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60015138", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Nottingham"}, "55415595600": {"Name": "Harman D.", "AuthorID": "55415595600", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60015138", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Nottingham"}, "6603107719": {"Name": "Ragunath K.", "AuthorID": "6603107719", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60015138", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Nottingham"}, "12242268700": {"Name": "Guha I.N.", "AuthorID": "12242268700", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60015138", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Nottingham Digestive Diseases Biomedical Research Centre (BRC), Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, University of Nottingham"}, "55338752000": {"Name": "B\u00f6hning D.", "AuthorID": "55338752000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Statistical Sciences Research Institute, University of Southampton"}, "57001188500": {"Name": "Parkes J.", "AuthorID": "57001188500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Sciences & Medical Statistics, University of Southampton"}}}
