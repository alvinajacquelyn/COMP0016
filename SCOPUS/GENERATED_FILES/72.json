Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Short-term linguistic accommodation has been observed in a number of spoken language studies. The first of its kind in sign language research, this study aims to investigate the effects of regional varieties in contact and lexical accommodation in British Sign Language (BSL). Twenty-five participants were recruited from Belfast, Glasgow, Manchester, and Newcastle and paired with the same conversational partner. Participants completed a \"spot-the-difference\" task which elicited a considerable amount of contrasting regionally specific sign data in the participant-confederate dyads. Accommodation was observed during the task with younger signers accommodating more than older signers. The results are interpreted with reference to the relationship between language contact and lexical accommodation in BSL, and address how further studies could help us better understand how contact and accommodation contribute to language change more generally.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Comprehension", "Empirical Research", "Female", "Great Britain", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Persons With Hearing Impairments", "Residence Characteristics", "Sign Language", "Social Environment", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954357755", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"56147412800": {"Name": "Stamp R.", "AuthorID": "56147412800", "AffiliationID": "60002999", "AffiliationName": "University of Haifa"}, "25951617200": {"Name": "Schembri A.", "AuthorID": "25951617200", "AffiliationID": "60006925", "AffiliationName": "La Trobe University"}, "36922341100": {"Name": "Evans B.G.", "AuthorID": "36922341100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London"}, "25951275900": {"Name": "Cormier K.", "AuthorID": "25951275900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London"}}}
