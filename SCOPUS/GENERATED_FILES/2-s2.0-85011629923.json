Whether or not low temperatures increase novel cardiovascular disease risk factors levels is not well studied. The aim was to investigate associations of outdoor temperature with a comprehensive range of established and novel cardiovascular disease risk factors in two large Northern European studies of older adults, in whom cardiovascular disease risk is increased. Design and methods Data came from the British Regional Heart Study (4252 men aged 60-79 years) and the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (5804 men and women aged 70-82 years). Associations between outdoor temperature and cardiovascular disease risk factors were quantified in each study and then pooled using a random effects model. Results With a 5\u00b0C lower mean temperature, total cholesterol was 0.04 mmol/l (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.07) higher, low density lipoprotein cholesterol was 0.02 mmol/l (95% CI 0.01-0.05) higher and SBP was 1.12 mm Hg (95% CI 0.60-1.64) higher. Among novel cardiovascular disease risk factors, C-reactive protein was 3.3% (95% CI 1.0-5.6%) higher, interleukin-6 was 2.7% (95% CI 1.1-4.3%) higher, and Vitamin D was 11.2% (95% CI 1.0-20.4%) lower. Conclusions Lower outdoor temperature was associated with adverse effects on cholesterol, blood pressure, circulating inflammatory markers, and Vitamin D in two older populations. Public health approaches to protect the elderly against low temperatures could help in reducing the levels of several cardiovascular disease risk factors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "cardiovascular disease risk factors", "older adults", "outdoor temperature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Europe", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011629923", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55811454000": {"Name": "Sartini C.", "AuthorID": "55811454000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.J.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "8314911000": {"Name": "Barry S.J.E.", "AuthorID": "8314911000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow"}, "35308260700": {"Name": "Welsh P.", "AuthorID": "35308260700", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow"}, "7006691891": {"Name": "Ford I.", "AuthorID": "7006691891", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}, "56678958000": {"Name": "Lowe G.D.O.", "AuthorID": "56678958000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7007043802": {"Name": "Sattar N.", "AuthorID": "7007043802", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7404059581": {"Name": "Morris R.W.", "AuthorID": "7404059581", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
