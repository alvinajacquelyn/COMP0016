In meiosis, chromosomes replicate once in a diploid precursor cell (zygote), and then segregate twice to generate four haploid meiotic products, named spores in yeast. In S. pombe, Php4 is responsible for the transcriptional repression capability of the heteromeric CCAAT-binding factor to negatively regulate genes encoding iron-using proteins under low-iron conditions. Here, we show that the CCAAT-regulatory subunit Php4 is required for normal progression of meiosis under iron-limiting conditions. Cells lacking Php4 exhibit a meiotic arrest at metaphase I. Microscopic analyses of cells expressing functional GFP-Php4 show that it colocalizes with chromosomal material at every stage of meiosis under low concentrations of iron. In contrast, GFP-Php4 fluorescence signal is lost when cells undergo meiosis under iron-replete conditions. Global gene expression analysis of meiotic cells using DNA microarrays identified 137 genes that are regulated in an iron- and Php4-dependent manner. Among them, 18 genes are expressed exclusively during meiosis and constitute new putative Php4 target genes, which include hry1\u2020 and mug14\u2020. Further analysis validates that Php4 is required for maximal and timely repression of hry1\u2020 and mug14+ genes. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we show that Php4 specifically associates with hry1\u2020 and mug14\u2020 promoters in vivo. Taken together, the results reveal that in iron-starved meiotic cells, Php4 is essential for completion of the meiotic program since it participates in global gene expression reprogramming to optimize the use of limited available iron.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CCAAT-binding factor", "Fission yeast", "Iron-regulated genes", "Iron-sparing response", "Meiosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "CCAAT-Binding Factor", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Iron", "Meiosis", "Metaphase", "Mutation", "Nitrogen", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Protein Binding", "Protein Transport", "Schizosaccharomyces", "Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins", "Stress, Physiological", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994607143", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"56205853900": {"Name": "Brault A.", "AuthorID": "56205853900", "AffiliationID": "60011832", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Biochimie, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine et des Sciences de la Sant\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}, "56197888200": {"Name": "Normant V.", "AuthorID": "56197888200", "AffiliationID": "60011832", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Biochimie, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine et des Sciences de la Sant\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}, "56210757100": {"Name": "Garant J.", "AuthorID": "56210757100", "AffiliationID": "60011832", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Biochimie, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine et des Sciences de la Sant\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}, "7006017758": {"Name": "Labb\u00e9 S.", "AuthorID": "7006017758", "AffiliationID": "60011832", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de Biochimie, Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine et des Sciences de la Sant\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke"}, "21834547700": {"Name": "Rallis C.", "AuthorID": "21834547700", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "School of Health, Sport and Biosciences, University of East London"}, "6603788294": {"Name": "B\u00e4hler J.", "AuthorID": "6603788294", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
