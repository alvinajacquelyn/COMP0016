We conducted a phase II trial of standard CHOP-21 (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone every 21 d) with ofatumumab induction (Cycle 1: 300 mg day 1, 1000 mg day 8, 1000 mg day 15; Cycles 2\u20136: 1000 mg day 1) (CHOP-O) followed by 12 months ofatumumab maintenance (1000 mg given 8-weekly for up to six cycles). Forty-three patients were recruited of whom 37 were evaluable. Seventy-three per cent were aged >60 years. Over half of the patients received a fludarabine and cyclophosphamide-based regimen as prior CLL treatment. The overall response rate was 46% (complete response 27%, partial response 19%) at six cycles. The median progression-free survival was 6\u00b72 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4\u00b79\u201314\u00b70 months) and median OS was 11\u00b74 months (95% CI 6\u00b74\u201325\u00b76 months). Treatment-na\u00efve and TP53-intact patients had improved outcomes. Fifteen episodes of neutropenic fever and 46 non-neutropenic infections were observed. There were no treatment-related deaths. Seven patients received platinum-containing salvage at progression, with only one patient obtaining an adequate response to proceed to allogeneic transplantation. CHOP-O with ofatumumab maintenance provides minimal benefit beyond CHOP plus rutuximab. Standard immunochemotherapy for RS remains wholly inadequate for unselected RS. Multinational trials incorporating novel agents are urgently needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CHOP", "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia", "Ofatumumab", "Richter syndrome", "TP53"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988457283", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"55496044000": {"Name": "Eyre T.A.", "AuthorID": "55496044000", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Churchill Hospital"}, "54970512200": {"Name": "Clifford R.", "AuthorID": "54970512200", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR BRC Oxford Molecular Diagnostic Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "23024396800": {"Name": "Collins G.P.", "AuthorID": "23024396800", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Churchill Hospital"}, "14633695300": {"Name": "Hatton C.S.", "AuthorID": "14633695300", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Churchill Hospital"}, "57194699035": {"Name": "Littlewood T.J.", "AuthorID": "57194699035", "AffiliationID": "60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Churchill Hospital"}, "57203072636": {"Name": "Schuh A.", "AuthorID": "57203072636", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "39560937300": {"Name": "Cabes M.", "AuthorID": "39560937300", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR BRC Oxford Molecular Diagnostic Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "21741550300": {"Name": "Stamatopoulos B.", "AuthorID": "21741550300", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "12786149700": {"Name": "Bloor A.", "AuthorID": "12786149700", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, The Christie Hospital NHS Trust"}, "56536252600": {"Name": "Boyle L.", "AuthorID": "56536252600", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "OCTO \u2013 Oncology Clinical Trials Office, Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "56535780600": {"Name": "Roberts C.", "AuthorID": "56535780600", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology & Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7202390729": {"Name": "Love S.B.", "AuthorID": "7202390729", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Statistics in Medicine, Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology & Musculoskeletal Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "16184300100": {"Name": "Devereux S.", "AuthorID": "16184300100", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Kings College Hospital"}, "6701733908": {"Name": "Follows G.", "AuthorID": "6701733908", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57202632412": {"Name": "Fox C.P.", "AuthorID": "57202632412", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7004639728": {"Name": "Gribben J.", "AuthorID": "7004639728", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer, Barts & the London School of Medicine & Dentistry"}, "7003666955": {"Name": "Hillmen P.", "AuthorID": "7003666955", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "St James's Institute of Oncology; Dena Cohen, University of Leeds"}, "57202485001": {"Name": "McCarthy H.", "AuthorID": "57202485001", "AffiliationID": "60032889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Bournemouth Hospital"}, "7404760527": {"Name": "Murray J.", "AuthorID": "7404760527", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "7004135975": {"Name": "Pettitt A.R.", "AuthorID": "7004135975", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "6602075789": {"Name": "Soilleux E.", "AuthorID": "6602075789", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "7005624882": {"Name": "Wotherspoon A.", "AuthorID": "7005624882", "AffiliationID": "60028724, 60000145", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Clinical Cell Therapy, Jules Bordet Institute, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)"}}}
