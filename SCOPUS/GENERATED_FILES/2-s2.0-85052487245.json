Secondly, they provide the basis functions for self-consistent field expansion algorithms used in the evolution of N-body systems. We present a new family of biorthogonal potentialdensity pairs constructed using the Hankel transform of the Laguerre polynomials. The lowest order density basis functions are double-power-law profiles cusped like \u03c1 ~ r-2+1/\u03b1 at small radii with asymptotic density fall-off like \u03c1 ~ r-3-1/(2\u03b1). Here, \u03b1 is a parameter satisfying \u03b1 \u2265 1/2. The family therefore spans the range of inner density cusps found in numerical simulations, but has much shallower - and hence more realistic - outer slopes than the corresponding members of the only previously known family deduced by Zhao and exemplified by Hernquist & Ostriker. When \u03b1 = 1, the lowest order density profile has an inner density cusp of \u03c1 ~ r-1 and an outer density slope of \u03c1 ~ r-3.5, similar to the famous Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) model. For this reason, we demonstrate that our new expansion provides a more accurate representation of flattened NFW haloes than the competing Hernquist-Ostriker expansion.We utilize our new expansion by analysing a suite of numerically constructed haloes and providing the distributions of the expansion coefficients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: kinematics and dynamics", "Methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052487245", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57203605863": {"Name": "Lilley E.J.", "AuthorID": "57203605863", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "57195339746": {"Name": "Sanders J.L.", "AuthorID": "57195339746", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55566835100": {"Name": "Evans N.W.", "AuthorID": "55566835100", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "24173404700": {"Name": "Erkal D.", "AuthorID": "24173404700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences, University of Surrey"}}}
