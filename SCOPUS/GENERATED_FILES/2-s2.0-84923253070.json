We show how this quantity can be extracted from simulations of the mechanical disassembly of a cluster using guide particles in molecular dynamics. We disassemble clusters ranging in size from 5 to 27 argonlike Lennard-Jones atoms, thermalized at 60 K, and obtain excess free energies, by means of the Jarzynski equality, that are consistent with previous studies. We only simulate the cluster of interest, in contrast to approaches that require a series of comparisons to be made between clusters differing in size by one molecule. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the scheme and how it might be applied to more complex systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Between clusters", "Excess free energy", "Jarzynski equality", "Lennard Jones", "Metastable vapor", "Molecular clusters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923253070", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"36475873800": {"Name": "Tang H.Y.", "AuthorID": "36475873800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57203260116": {"Name": "Ford I.J.", "AuthorID": "57203260116", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
