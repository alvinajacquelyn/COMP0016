Methods Retrospective study with standardised longitudinal imaging preintervention and postintervention. The study cohort comprises 22 patients (22 eyes) with uveitic CMO receiving a sub-Tenon's triamcinolone acetonide (STTA) injection. Post hoc analysis of SD-OCT images using custom software provided an \u00e2 \u20ac absolute' measurement of vitreous signal intensity, which was expressed as a ratio to the retinal pigment epithelium intensity (\u00e2 \u20ac VIT/RPE-relative intensity') in arbitrary units. Main outcome measure Difference in VIT/RPE-relative intensity before and after treatment. Results Treatment with STTA resulted in a significant reduction in VIT/RPE-relative intensity, which was associated with both a reduction in central retinal thickness (CRT) and improvement in visual acuity. Mean (SD) VIT/RPE-relative intensity pretreatment was 0.139 (0.074) versus 0.053 (0.028) post-treatment (p=3\u00d710-5). Mean (SD) CRT was 581 \u03bcm (119 \u03bcm) pretreatment versus 333 \u03bcm (95 \u03bcm) post-treatment (p=2\u00d710-8); the mean reduction in CRT was 248 (95% CI 189 to 306). The correlation coefficient between VIT/RPE-relative intensity and CRT was 0.534 (p=0.011) and between VIT/RPE-relative intensity and visual acuity was 0.702 (p=0.0001). Conclusions This study provides evidence that the OCT-derived VIT/RPE-relative intensity may be useful as a quantitative and objective marker of disease activity and treatment response in uveitis complicated by CMO. This first longitudinal study of this novel OCT parameter is an encouraging step in the development of sensitive objective OCT-based endpoints for trials of efficacy in uveitis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diagnostic tests/Investigation", "Imaging", "Inflammation", "Macula", "Vitreous"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Female", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Injections, Intraocular", "Longitudinal Studies", "Macular Edema", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Triamcinolone Acetonide", "Uveitis", "Visual Acuity", "Vitreous Body", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966680757", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57193856870": {"Name": "Sreekantam S.", "AuthorID": "57193856870", "AffiliationID": "60007419, 60017140", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham and Midland Eye Centre, Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust"}, "35595791500": {"Name": "Murray P.I.", "AuthorID": "35595791500", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57189249038": {"Name": "Macdonald T.", "AuthorID": "57189249038", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54880010400": {"Name": "Denniston A.K.", "AuthorID": "54880010400", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "Academic Unit of Ophthalmology, Institute of Inflammation and Ageing, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "22958698000": {"Name": "Sim D.A.", "AuthorID": "22958698000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
