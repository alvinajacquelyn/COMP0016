The as-made titanate nanomaterials were characterised using powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller analysis and transmission electron microscopy, and evaluated as potential electrode materials for Li-ion and Na-ion batteries. Cyclic voltammetry studies on half-cells revealed that the sodium titanate nanomaterial stored charge primarily through a combination of pseudocapacitive and diffusion-limited processes in both systems. Electrochemical cycling tests at a high specific current of 1000 mA g\u22121, revealed that the Li-ion and Na-ion cells retained relatively high specific capacities after 400 cycles of 131 and 87 mAh g\u22121, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of CHFS-made sodium titanate nanopower as an anode material for both Li- and Na-ion cell chemistries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "High power", "Li-ion battery", "Na-ion battery", "Na2Ti3O7", "Sodium titanate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "High power", "Na-ion batteries", "Na2Ti3O7", "Sodium titanates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055623003", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57201802769": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57201802769", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science Technology and Research)"}, "57194060033": {"Name": "Bauer D.", "AuthorID": "57194060033", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55226279200": {"Name": "L\u00fcbke M.", "AuthorID": "55226279200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56096150800": {"Name": "Ashton T.E.", "AuthorID": "56096150800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8938607100": {"Name": "Zong Y.", "AuthorID": "8938607100", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR (Agency for Science Technology and Research)"}}}
