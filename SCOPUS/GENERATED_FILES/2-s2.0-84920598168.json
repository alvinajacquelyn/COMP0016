Determining the direction to such goals is a crucial first step in navigation. Surprisingly, little is known about how or where in the brain this \"goal direction signal\" is represented. In mammals, \"head-direction cells\" are thought to support this process, but despite 30 years of research, no evidence for a goal direction representation has been reported [1, 2]. Here, we used fMRI to record neural activity while participants made goal direction judgments based on a previously learned virtual environment. We applied multivoxel pattern analysis [3-5] to these data and found that the human entorhinal/subicular region contains a neural representation of intended goal direction. Furthermore, the neural pattern expressed for a given goal direction matched the pattern expressed when simply facing that same direction. This suggests the existence of a shared neural representation of both goal and facing direction. We argue that this reflects a mechanism based on head-direction populations that simulate future goal directions during route planning [6]. Our data further revealed that the strength of direction information predicts performance. Finally, we found a dissociation between this geocentric information in the entorhinal/subicular region and egocentric direction information in the precuneus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Entorhinal Cortex", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Goals", "Healthy Volunteers", "Homing Behavior", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Parietal Lobe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920598168", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56219505000": {"Name": "Chadwick M.J.", "AuthorID": "56219505000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57194123570": {"Name": "Jolly A.E.J.", "AuthorID": "57194123570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "6603575074": {"Name": "Spiers H.J.", "AuthorID": "6603575074", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "55700049600": {"Name": "Amos D.P.", "AuthorID": "55700049600", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Neurology, Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "15839738700": {"Name": "Hassabis D.", "AuthorID": "15839738700", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College, Alexandra House"}}}
