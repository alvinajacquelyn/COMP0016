However, although relative glacial and interglacial intensities are well studied, there are still few proxies that permit quantitative terrestrial temperature and precipitation reconstruction. In this context, fauna-based climate reconstructions based on evidence preserved in archaeological or palaeontological sites are of great interest, even if they only document short windows of that climate variability, because (a) they provide a range of temperature and precipitation estimates that are understandable in comparison with present climate; (b) they may allow the testing of predicted temperature changes under scenarios of future climate change; and (c) quantitative temperature and precipitation estimates for past glacials and interglacials for specific regions/latitudes can help to understand their effects on flora, fauna and hominids, as they are directly associated with those cultural and/or biological events. Moreover such reconstructions can bring further arguments to the discussion about important climatic events like the Mid-Bruhnes Event, a climatic transition between moderate warmths and greater warmths during interglacials. In this paper we review a decade of amphibian- and reptile-based climate reconstructions carried out for the Iberian Peninsula using the Mutual Ecogeographic Range method in order to present a regional synthesis from MIS 22 to MIS 6, discuss the climate pattern in relation to the Mid-Bruhnes Event and the thermal amplitude suggested by these estimates and finally to identify the chronological gaps that have still to be investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amphibian", "Middle Pleistocene", "Mutual Ecogeographic Range", "Reptile", "South-Western Mediterranean", "Vertebrates as climate proxy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amphibian", "Climate proxies", "Middle Pleistocene", "Mutual Ecogeographic Range", "Reptile", "Western Mediterranean"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047148989", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"17433722100": {"Name": "Blain H.A.", "AuthorID": "17433722100", "AffiliationID": "60022415", "AffiliationName": "Area de Prehistoria, Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV)"}, "57202095886": {"Name": "Cruz Silva J.A.", "AuthorID": "57202095886", "AffiliationID": "60024830", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Paleontolog\u00eda, Facultad de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Benem\u00e9rita Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Puebla 112-A, Ciudad Universitaria"}, "36634302200": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez Arenas J.M.", "AuthorID": "36634302200", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University of Zurich"}, "15072991400": {"Name": "Margari V.", "AuthorID": "15072991400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Geography"}, "6506508757": {"Name": "Roucoux K.", "AuthorID": "6506508757", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "University of St. Andrews, School of Geography & Sustainaible Development"}}}
