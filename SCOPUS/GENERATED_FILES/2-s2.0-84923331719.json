Sudden-onset hearing loss after stroke of the vertebrobasilar territory and/or low brainstem is one of the less frequent neurologic impairments, while cortical or central deafness is even rarer. However, studies of populations with stroke indicate that hearing loss is very common, while in the general population, a past history of stroke increases the likelihood of having hearing loss. Auditory-processing deficits after stroke are less well studied than hearing loss and possibly underdocumented. Auditory dysfunction may impact on patient communication and may even predict long-term patient outcome after stroke. Despite this, clinical guidelines for auditory assessments after stroke are rudimentary. This chapter reviews the available information of auditory function in patients with stroke. On the basis of the information available, it is suggested that screening the patient's hearing before the patient leaves the stroke ward with a short test and a minimum set of hearing-related questions and subsequently screening the patient's hearing needs with targeted questions at the chronic stage of stroke may be a cost-effective bare-minimum assessment approach to addressing the hearing needs of this complex population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory processing", "Hearing", "Stroke", "Sudden hearing loss"], "IndexKeywords": ["Auditory Pathways", "Hearing Disorders", "Humans", "Stroke"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923331719", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6701719104": {"Name": "Bamiou D.E.", "AuthorID": "6701719104", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ear Institute, University College London and Neuro-otology Department, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
