Little is known about psychosocial factors prospectively predicting maintenance/cessation or the new onset of clinically significant disordered eating symptoms. This study aimed to address these research gaps. College women (N = 2202) completed an assessment of eating pathology and potential risk/maintenance factors at two time points, 9 months apart. Logistic regression models indicated that elevated body dissatisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, self-objectification, negative affectivity and lower self-esteem at baseline predicted 'onset' of clinically significant disordered eating symptomatology at follow-up. Greater self-esteem and lower initial levels on the remaining risk factors predicted subsequent 'cessation' of clinically significant disordered eating symptoms. Self-objectification had greater explanatory value with regard to 'cessation' and 'onset' relative to the remaining traditionally accepted factors that demonstrated half as much predictive power or less. Practical implications are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["eating pathology", "longitudinal study", "maintenance/cessation", "risk factors", "women"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Body Image", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Italy", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Self Concept", "Universities", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983002503", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55366742000": {"Name": "Dakanalis A.", "AuthorID": "55366742000", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interdisciplinary Medicine, University of Milan-Bicocca"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Interdisciplinary Medicine, University of Milan-Bicocca"}, "21233554200": {"Name": "Timko A.", "AuthorID": "21233554200", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}, "54910848200": {"Name": "Serino S.", "AuthorID": "54910848200", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Applied Technology for Neuro-Psychology Laboratory, Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}, "56962750600": {"Name": "Riva G.", "AuthorID": "56962750600", "AffiliationID": "60024053", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Catholic University of Milan"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
