All rights reserved.Although vasculopathy and endothelial activation may be important in the pathogenesis of lupus, true vasculitis demonstrated by histology, arteriography, or classical clinical presentation is less common. Estimates of the prevalence of vasculitis in patients with lupus range from 11% to 36% and the vast majority of cases are cutaneous and respond to antimalarials or oral corticosteroids. Visceral vasculitis is less common but more serious. Vasculitis of the large vessels is rare and has mainly been described in case reports. Lupus mesenteric vasculitis typically presents with abdominal pain and should be considered in any lupus patient presenting with an acute abdomen. Although earlier reports recommended early laparotomy in these patients, diagnosis using computed tomography (CT) scanning followed by intravenous corticosteroids (and sometimes immunosuppressants) is now recommended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cutaneous", "Mesenteric", "Systemic lupus erythematosus", "Vasculitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967239516", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57212819228": {"Name": "Rahman A.", "AuthorID": "57212819228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
