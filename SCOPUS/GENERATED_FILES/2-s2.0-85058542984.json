One such response, the blink reflex evoked by intense electrical stimulation of the median nerve (Hand-Blink Reflex; HBR), has been extensively used to derive fine-grained maps of defensive peripersonal space. However, as other subcortical reflexes, the HBR might also be modulated by lower-level factors that do not bear direct relevance to the defensive value of blinking, thus posing methodological and interpretive problems. Here, we tested whether HBR magnitude is affected by the muscular effort present when holding the hand in certain postures. We found that HBR magnitude increases with muscular effort, an effect most likely mediated by the increased corticospinal drive. However, we found strong evidence that this effect is substantially smaller than the well-known effect of eye-hand proximity on HBR magnitude. Nonetheless, care should be taken in future experiments to avoid erroneous interpretations of the effects of muscular effort as indicators of behaviour relevance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blink reflex", "Defence", "Motor system", "Muscular effort", "Threat"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blinking", "Electric Stimulation", "Female", "Hand", "Humans", "Male", "Median Nerve", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Posture", "Reflex", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058542984", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57060570800": {"Name": "Bufacchi R.", "AuthorID": "57060570800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and EXperimental biology (CoMPLEX), University College London"}, "57205094713": {"Name": "Ponticelli S.", "AuthorID": "57205094713", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London (UCL)"}, "35975054700": {"Name": "Kilintari M.", "AuthorID": "35975054700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London (UCL)"}, "57203395070": {"Name": "Guo Y.", "AuthorID": "57203395070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London (UCL)"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "37056031000": {"Name": "Novembre G.", "AuthorID": "37056031000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Behaviour Laboratory, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}}}
