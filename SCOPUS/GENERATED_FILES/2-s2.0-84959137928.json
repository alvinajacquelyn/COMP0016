In the marine environment, the 1987 TBT ban resulted in expanded use of alternative biocides, raising the question of whether these products too have impacted the Broads ecosystem and freshwaters in general. We examined the lake sediment record in the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads for contamination by copper (Cu), an active biocide agent, and zinc (Zn), a component of booster biocides, to assess their occurrence and potential for causing environmental harm in freshwater ecosystems. After the introduction of leisure boating, there was a statistically significant difference in Cu enrichment between heavily and lightly boated sites, whereas no such difference existed prior to that time. At the heavily boated sites, the onset of Cu enrichment coincided with a period of rapid increase in leisure boating. Such enrichment has been maintained to the present day, with some evidence of continued increase. We conclude that Cu-based antifouling has measurably contaminated lakes exposed to boating, at concentrations high enough to cause ecological harm. Similar findings can be expected at other boated freshwater ecosystems elsewhere in the world.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antifouling paint", "Copper", "Freshwater", "Lake sediment", "Pollution", "TBT"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959137928", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"57203071414": {"Name": "Boyle J.F.", "AuthorID": "57203071414", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Planning, University of Liverpool"}, "7003314493": {"Name": "Sayer C.D.", "AuthorID": "7003314493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "6701746027": {"Name": "Bennion H.", "AuthorID": "6701746027", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "57203203579": {"Name": "Rose N.L.", "AuthorID": "57203203579", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7005359587": {"Name": "Hoare D.", "AuthorID": "7005359587", "AffiliationID": "60113087", "AffiliationName": "Broads Authority, Yare House"}, "57103580500": {"Name": "Heppel K.", "AuthorID": "57103580500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Queen Mary University of London"}, "13008090900": {"Name": "Lambert S.J.", "AuthorID": "13008090900", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60176145", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Norwich Research Park, University of East Anglia"}, "7006931326": {"Name": "Davy A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006931326", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60176145", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Norwich Research Park, University of East Anglia"}, "7006332352": {"Name": "Appleby P.G.", "AuthorID": "7006332352", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Liverpool"}}}
