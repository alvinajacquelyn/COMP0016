We hypothesized that family history would be more strongly associated with CHD in South Asians. Methods: We performed cross-sectional analyses of 20-year follow-up data from SABRE (Southall And Brent Revisited) population-based study. Initial recruitment (1988\u20131991) was by random selection from general practitioners' lists in north-west London. 974 Europeans and 734 South Asians completed follow-up questionnaire (2008\u20132011) and had complete CHD and family history data. 831 participants without cardiovascular disease had complete coronary artery calcium (CAC) data. Results: South Asians with family history of CHD were more likely to have diagnosed CHD (odds ratio 1.71 [95% CI 1.21, 2.42]; p = 0.002) and more previous CHD events (regression coefficient 0.44 [0.16, 0.72]; p = 0.002) than those without family history, independent of biological and sociodemographic risk factors. Family history associations with diagnosed CHD/number of events were weaker in Europeans (odds ratio 1.11 [0.78, 1.57]; p = 0.562/regression coefficient 0.02 [\u22120.25, 0.30]; p = 0.878), largely explained by biological risk factors. South Asians with family history had modestly increased CAC burden compared with Europeans. Conclusions: There were markedly stronger associations between family history and clinical CHD in South Asians, and a similar trend for subclinical CHD. Early preventive and therapeutic interventions are particularly important in South Asians with a family history of CHD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coronary artery calcium", "Coronary heart disease", "European", "Family history", "South Asian"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Asia, Southeastern", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "Coronary Disease", "Coronary Vessels", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "England", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Medical History Taking", "Middle Aged", "Vascular Calcification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070225376", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57194288913": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57194288913", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "8878251700": {"Name": "Tillin T.", "AuthorID": "8878251700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57207789660": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "57207789660", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005513520": {"Name": "Chaturvedi N.", "AuthorID": "7005513520", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
