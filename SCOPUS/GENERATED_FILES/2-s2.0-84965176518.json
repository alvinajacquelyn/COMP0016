This article presents the methodology for the development of a numerical model of the quincha system. The quincha walls have been subdivided into three components, the timber frame, bracing, and infill, and the modeling of each component is calibrated separately using experimental and analytical techniques. The resulting numerical model is found to successfully reproduce the behaviour of test specimens. The developed model can be used to assess the global seismic behavior of historic buildings containing quincha of varying geometries. This is demonstrated by modeling a portion of one of the facades of a well-known casona in Lima, Hotel el Comercio.", "AuthorKeywords": ["infilled timber frames", "numerical modeling", "Peru", "quincha", "seismic assessment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Construction technique", "Historic buildings", "Peru", "Quincha", "Residential building", "Seismic assessment", "Structural characterization", "Timber frames"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965176518", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Visual Arts and Performing Arts", "ARTS", "1213"]], "AuthorData": {"57213463413": {"Name": "Quinn N.", "AuthorID": "57213463413", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "57211644046": {"Name": "Dayala D.", "AuthorID": "57211644046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "35208273400": {"Name": "Descamps T.", "AuthorID": "35208273400", "AffiliationID": "60010758", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural Mechanics, University of Mons"}}}
