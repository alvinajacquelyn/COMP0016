Cancer-induced bone pain involves a complex interplay of molecular events, including mechanisms observed in inflammatory and neuropathic pain states, but also changes unique for cancer-induced bone pain. The P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is involved in a variety of cellular functions and has been linked to both inflammatory and neuropathic pain. Here we study the analgesic potential of P2X7R antagonism in a rat model of cancer-induced bone pain. In cancer-bearing animals, the P2X7R antagonist A839977 attenuated dorsal horn neuronal responses in a modality and intensity-specific way. Spinal application of 0.4-mg/kg and 1.2-mg/kg A839977 significantly reduced the evoked responses to high-intensity mechanical and thermal stimulation, whereas no effect was seen in response to low-intensity or electrical stimulation. In contrast, A839977 had no effect on the tested parameters in na\u00efve or sham animals. In awake animals, 40-mg/kg A839977 (i.p.) significantly reduced both early- and late-stage pain behavior. In contrast, no effect was observed in sham or vehicle-treated animals. The results suggest that the P2X7R is involved in the mechanisms of cancer-induced bone pain, and that P2X7R antagonism might be a useful analgesic target. No effect was observed in sham or na\u00efve animals, indicating that the P2X7R-mediated effect is state-dependent, and might therefore be an advantageous target compared to traditional analgesics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analgesia", "Cancer-induced bone pain", "Neuronal responses", "P2X7R antagonism", "Pain behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analgesics, Non-Narcotic", "Animals", "Bone Neoplasms", "Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Male", "Mammary Neoplasms, Animal", "Motor Activity", "Neoplasm Transplantation", "Pain", "Posterior Horn Cells", "Purinergic P2X Receptor Antagonists", "Pyridines", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Receptors, Purinergic P2X7", "Tetrazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923348598", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55243220100": {"Name": "Falk S.", "AuthorID": "55243220100", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology, University of Copenhagen"}, "55429334900": {"Name": "Schwab S.", "AuthorID": "55429334900", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology, University of Copenhagen"}, "56527236600": {"Name": "Fr\u00f8sig-J\u00f8rgensen M.", "AuthorID": "56527236600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology, University of Copenhagen"}, "7003423087": {"Name": "Clausen R.", "AuthorID": "7003423087", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology, University of Copenhagen"}, "6603562860": {"Name": "Heegaard A.", "AuthorID": "6603562860", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology, University of Copenhagen"}, "7101706308": {"Name": "Dickenson A.", "AuthorID": "7101706308", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
