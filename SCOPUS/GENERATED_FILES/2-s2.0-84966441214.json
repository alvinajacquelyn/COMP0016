Patients & methods: In a discovery meta-analysis (five studies, 1991 individuals), we investigated the effects of approximately 50000 single nucleotide polymorphisms on statin response, following up associations with p < 1 \u00d7 10-4 (three independent studies, 5314 individuals). We further assessed the effect of a GRS based on SNPs in ABCG2, LPA and APOE. Results: No new SNPs were found associated with statin response. The GRS was associated with reduced statin response: 0.0394 mmol/l per allele (95% CI: 0.0171-0.0617, p = 5.37 \u00d7 10-4). Conclusion: The GRS was associated with statin response, but the small effect size (\u223c2% of the average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction) limits applicability.", "AuthorKeywords":
