All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: Kinesin-like protein 6 (KIF6), a member of the kinesin superfamily, is involved in intracellular transport. A few prospective studies have shown the KIF6 variant Trp719Arg (rs20455) to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in Caucasian populations. However, recent genome-wide association studies on CAD have not proven these associations. OBJECTIVES: Since the role of KIF6 719Arg allele in other ethnic populations is largely unknown, we sought to determine whether the KIF6 719Arg allele is associated with CAD in an ethnic population of Saudi Arabia. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: CAD patients and control subjects from King Fahd Hospital of the University, Al-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population included angiographically defined CAD patients (n=1002) and controls (n=984) with a normal electrocardiogram. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Association of KIF6 Trp719Arg mutation with CAD. RESULTS: The KIF6 Trp719Arg polymorphism was not associated with CAD (OR 0.976, 95% CI 0.861-1.105; P=.704). In addition, KIF6 Trp719Arg polymorphism showed a lack of association even in stratified myocardial infarction patients (n=802) (OR 1.006, 95% CI 0.881-1.148; P=.929) in comparison to controls. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of Trp719Arg polymorphism association with CAD and CAD in stratified myocardial infarction cases indicates that the polymorphism is not associated with an increased risk among CAD patients from the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Further studies in different provinces are required to unravel biological mechanisms underlying CAD in patients from Saudi Arabia. LIMITATIONS: Unavailability of data on statin usage among the patient population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Alleles", "Case-Control Studies", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Kinesin", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Myocardial Infarction", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Saudi Arabia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995395013", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56549975400": {"Name": "Vatte C.", "AuthorID": "56549975400", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Research and Medical Consultation, University of Dammam"}, "57188931997": {"Name": "Cyrus C.", "AuthorID": "57188931997", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Research and Medical Consultation, University of Dammam"}, "25026953200": {"Name": "Chathoth S.", "AuthorID": "25026953200", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Research and Medical Consultation, University of Dammam"}, "7005259340": {"Name": "Al Ali A.", "AuthorID": "7005259340", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Research and Medical Consultation, University of Dammam"}, "57188728416": {"Name": "Al Shehri A.M.", "AuthorID": "57188728416", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, King Fahd Hospital of the University"}, "14059603200": {"Name": "Almansori M.", "AuthorID": "14059603200", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, King Fahd Hospital of the University"}, "6504373980": {"Name": "Al-Nafaie A.", "AuthorID": "6504373980", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, King Fahd Hospital of the University"}, "56641369200": {"Name": "Al-Ali R.", "AuthorID": "56641369200", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, King Fahd Hospital of the University"}, "35589136600": {"Name": "Al-Muhanna F.", "AuthorID": "35589136600", "AffiliationID": "60104334", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, King Fahd Hospital of the University"}, "57202567488": {"Name": "Asselbergs F.W.", "AuthorID": "57202567488", "AffiliationID": "60002794", "AffiliationName": "Durrer Center Cardiogenetic Research, ICIN-Netherlands Heart Institute"}}}
