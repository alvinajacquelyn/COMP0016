Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The zinc-dependent Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) found within the extracellular matrix (ECM) of vertebrates are linked to pathological processes such as arthritis, skin ulceration and cancer. Although a general backbone proteolytic mechanism is understood, crystallographic data continue to suggest an active site that is too narrow to encompass the respective substrate. We present a fully parameterised Molecular Dynamics (MD) study of the structural properties of an MMP-1-collagen crystallographic structure (Protein Data Bank\u20134AUO), followed by an exploration of the free energy surface of a collagen polypeptide chain entering the active site, using a combined meta-dynamics and umbrella sampling (MDUS) approach. We conclude that the interactions between MMP-1 and the collagen substrate are in good agreement with a number of experimental studies. As such, our unrestrained MD simulations and our MDUS results, which indicate an energetic barrier for a local uncoiling and insertion event, can inform future investigations of the collagen-peptide non-bonded association steps with the active site prior to proteolytic mechanisms. The elucidation of such free energy barriers provides a better understanding of the role of the enzyme in the ECM and is important in the design of future MMP inhibitors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["collagenase", "free energy", "matrix-metalloproteinase", "metzincin", "proteinase", "zinc"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Catalytic Domain", "Humans", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Ligands", "Matrix Metalloproteinase 1", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Solvents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964523754", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"56356929800": {"Name": "Nash A.", "AuthorID": "56356929800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "de Leeuw N.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "7005706824": {"Name": "Birch H.", "AuthorID": "7005706824", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics & Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}}}
