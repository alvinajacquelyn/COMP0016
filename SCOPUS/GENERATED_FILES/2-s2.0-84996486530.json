The molecular clock drives rhythmic electrical excitability of clock neurons, and we show that the recently discovered light-input factor Quasimodo (Qsm) regulates this variation, presumably via an Na+, K+, Cl-cotransporter (NKCC) and the Shaw K+ channel (dKV3.1). Because of light-dependent degradation of the clock protein Timeless (Tim), constant illumination (LL) leads to a breakdown of molecular and behavioral rhythms. Both overexpression (OX) and knockdown (RNAi) of qsm, NKCC, or Shaw led to robust LL rhythmicity. Whole-cell recordings of the large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNv) showed that altering Qsm levels reduced the daily variation in neuronal activity: qsmOX led to a constitutive less active, night-like state, and qsmRNAi led to a more active, daylike state. Qsm also affected daily changes in K+ currents and the GABA reversal potential, suggesting a role in modifying membrane currents and GABA responses in a daily fashion, potentially modulating light arousal and input to the clock. When directly challenged with blue light, wild-type l-LNvs responded with increased firing at night and no net response during the day, whereas altering Qsm, NKKC, or Shaw levels abolished these day/night differences. Finally, coexpression of ShawOX and NKCCRNAi in a qsm mutant background restored LL-induced behavioral arrhythmicity and wild-type neuronal activity patterns, suggesting that the three genes operate in the same pathway. We propose that Qsm affects both daily and acute light effects in l-LNvs probably acting on Shaw and NKCC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circadian rhythms", "Gaba reversal potential", "Light input", "Membrane excitability", "Potassium currents"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Circadian Clocks", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Genotype", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Ion Channel Gating", "Light", "Models, Biological", "Neurons", "Protein Binding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996486530", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24586908900": {"Name": "Buhl E.", "AuthorID": "24586908900", "AffiliationID": "60111707, 60026479", "AffiliationName": "Hatherly Laboratories, University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter"}, "7103254759": {"Name": "Hodge J.", "AuthorID": "7103254759", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Physiology, Pharmacology and Neuroscience, University of Bristol"}, "57192066375": {"Name": "Bradlaugh A.", "AuthorID": "57192066375", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary College"}, "36642720300": {"Name": "Ogueta M.", "AuthorID": "36642720300", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Neuro- and Behavioral Biology, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms University"}, "6701778379": {"Name": "Stanewsky R.", "AuthorID": "6701778379", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Neuro- and Behavioral Biology, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms University"}, "15829318200": {"Name": "Chen K.", "AuthorID": "15829318200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
