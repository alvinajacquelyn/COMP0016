Synapse loss is a significant correlate of cognitive decline that serves as a critical hallmark of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases; however, mechanisms underlying synaptic vulnerability remain elusive. Emerging research on microglia function in the healthy brain is providing new insight into fundamental roles of microglia and immune molecules in brain wiring. Among their many roles, microglia prune developing synapses and regulate synaptic plasticity and function. Here, we review and discuss how this emerging work may provide new insight into how disruptions in microglia-synapse interactions could contribute to synapse loss and dysfunction, and consequently cognitive impairment, in AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Brain", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Microglia", "Neuronal Plasticity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952700826", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55570445500": {"Name": "Hong S.", "AuthorID": "55570445500", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, F.M.
