Therefore, the aim was to investigate if addiction-specific brief risk screening is effective in identifying high mortality risk groups and if subsequent clinical actions following risk assessment impacts on mortality levels. Methods: Opioid use disorder (OUD) patients were identified in the South London and Maudsley Case Register. Deaths were identified through database linkage to the national mortality dataset. Cox and competing-risk regression were used to model associations between brief risk assessment domains and all-cause and overdose mortality in 4488 OUD patients, with up-to 6-year follow-up time where 227 deaths were registered. Data were stratified by admission to general mental health services. Results: All-cause mortality was significantly associated with unsafe injecting (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10-2.11) and clinically appraised likelihood of accidental overdose (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.00-2.19). Overdose-mortality was significantly associated with unsafe injecting (SHR 2.52, 95% CI 1.11-5.70) and clinically appraised suicidality (SHR 2.89, 95% CI 1.38-6.03). Suicidality was associated with a twofold increase in mortality risk among OUD patients who were not admitted to mental health services within 2 months of their risk assessment (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.67-3.24). Conclusions: Diagnosis-specific brief risk screening can identify OUD patient subgroups at increased risk of all-cause and overdose mortality. OUD patients, where suicidality is evident, who are not admitted into services are particularly vulnerable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Heroin", "Injecting", "Mortality", "Opioids", "Overdose", "Risk assessment", "Suicide", "Treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cause of Death", "Drug Overdose", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Medical Records", "Mental Health Services", "Mentally Ill Persons", "Middle Aged", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Risk Assessment", "Suicide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970031392", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55326661700": {"Name": "Bogdanowicz K.", "AuthorID": "55326661700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "35594617600": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "35594617600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "35214290900": {"Name": "Chang C.", "AuthorID": "35214290900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "56278508000": {"Name": "Downs J.", "AuthorID": "56278508000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "36196573000": {"Name": "Khondoker M.", "AuthorID": "36196573000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Epidemiology and Health"}, "7102963151": {"Name": "Strang J.", "AuthorID": "7102963151", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55790763300": {"Name": "Hayes R.", "AuthorID": "55790763300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "56662841600": {"Name": "Shetty H.", "AuthorID": "56662841600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Epidemiology and Health"}}}
