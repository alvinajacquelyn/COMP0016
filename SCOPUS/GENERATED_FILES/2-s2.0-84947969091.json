It yields fast convergence of the electromagnetic far-field and has been adapted to model various optical devices and wave configurations. In this article, we investigate the accuracy with which the electromagnetic near-field can be calculated by using RCWA and explain the observed slow convergence and numerical artifacts from which it suffers, namely unphysical oscillations at material boundaries due to the Gibbs phenomenon. In order to alleviate these shortcomings, we also introduce a mathematical formulation for accurate near-field calculation in RCWA, for one- and two-dimensional straight and slanted diffraction gratings. This accurate near-field computational approach is tested and evaluated for several representative test-structures and configurations in order to illustrate the advantages provided by the proposed modified formulation of the RCWA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["computational electromagnetic methods", "diffraction gratings", "optics at surfaces", "plasmonics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational electromagnetic methods", "Electromagnetic far field", "Electromagnetic near fields", "Mathematical formulation", "Optics at surface", "Rigorous coupled wave analysis", "The rigorous coupledwave analyses (RCWA)", "Unphysical oscillations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947969091", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55671101600": {"Name": "Weismann M.", "AuthorID": "55671101600", "AffiliationID": "100397288", "AffiliationName": "Photon Design Ltd"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.C.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55635229800": {"Name": "Gallagher D.F.G.", "AuthorID": "55635229800", "AffiliationID": "100397288", "AffiliationName": "Photon Design Ltd"}}}
