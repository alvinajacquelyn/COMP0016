Published under the terms of the CC BY 4.0 licenseThe cell division cycle culminates in mitosis when two daughter cells are born. As cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity reaches its peak, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is activated to trigger sister chromatid separation and mitotic spindle elongation, followed by spindle disassembly and cytokinesis. Degradation of mitotic cyclins and activation of Cdk-counteracting phosphatases are thought to cause protein dephosphorylation to control these sequential events. Here, we use budding yeast to analyze phosphorylation dynamics of 3,456 phosphosites on 1,101 proteins with high temporal resolution as cells progress synchronously through mitosis. This reveals that successive inactivation of S and M phase Cdks and of the mitotic kinase Polo contributes to order these dephosphorylation events. Unexpectedly, we detect as many new phosphorylation events as there are dephosphorylation events. These correlate with late mitotic kinase activation and identify numerous candidate targets of these kinases. These findings revise our view of mitotic exit and portray it as a dynamic process in which a range of mitotic kinases contribute to order both protein dephosphorylation and phosphorylation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cell cycle", "kinases", "mitosis", "phosphatases", "phosphoproteomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Cycle", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cytokinesis", "Mitosis", "Phosphoprotein Phosphatases", "Phosphoproteins", "Phosphorylation", "Proteolysis", "Proteome", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins", "Saccharomycetales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045235196", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"55327720400": {"Name": "Touati S.", "AuthorID": "55327720400", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Segregation Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57193091427": {"Name": "Kataria M.", "AuthorID": "57193091427", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "7005894260": {"Name": "Uhlmann F.", "AuthorID": "7005894260", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Chromosome Segregation Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "57201830062": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "57201830062", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Science Technology Platform, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "10039862900": {"Name": "Snijders A.", "AuthorID": "10039862900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Science Technology Platform, The Francis Crick Institute"}}}
