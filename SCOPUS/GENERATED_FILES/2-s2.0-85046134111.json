All rights reserved.Quadruplex nucleic acids are formed by repetitive short tracts of guanine nucleotides folding into four-stranded structures. These sequences are found throughout the human genome but are overrepresented in the promoter sequences of a number of cancer-associated genes, notably in oncogenes such as c-. MYC and c-. KIT. Small molecules can bind to these sequences and stabilize the resulting quadruplex structures. As a consequence, transcription of the affected gene can be impaired, and also the presence of a quadruplex arrangement may elicit a local yet lethal DNA damage response and ultimately anticancer activity. This article describes the basis for quadruplex-targeted chemotherapy and focuses on surveying the small molecules that have been used as selective promoter quadruplex stabilizers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "In silico screening", "Oncogenes", "Promoters", "Quadruplex", "Small molecules", "Structure-based design", "Telomere"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046134111", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"7003821508": {"Name": "Paulo A.", "AuthorID": "7003821508", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "University of Lisbon"}, "57201802603": {"Name": "Castillo C.", "AuthorID": "57201802603", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
