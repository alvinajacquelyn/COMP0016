Short encapsulation peptides can direct cargo proteins to the lumen of the compartments. However, the fusion of such peptides to non-native proteins does not guarantee encapsulation and often causes aggregation. Here, we report an approach for targeting recombinant proteins to BMCs that utilizes specific de novo coiled-coil protein\u2013protein interactions. Attachment of one coiled-coil module to PduA (a component of the BMC shell) allows targeting of a fluorescent protein fused to a cognate coiled-coil partner. This interaction takes place on the outer surface of the BMC. The redesign of PduA to generate an N-terminus on the luminal side of the BMC results in intact compartments to which proteins can still be targeted via the designed coiled-coil system. This study provides a strategy to display proteins on the surface or within the lumen of the BMCs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacteria", "Bacterial Proteins", "Cytoplasm", "Protein Binding", "Protein Structure, Secondary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052077487", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56286006800": {"Name": "Lee M.J.", "AuthorID": "56286006800", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Biotechnology Centre, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "24283220700": {"Name": "Brown I.R.", "AuthorID": "24283220700", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Biotechnology Centre, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "7202137554": {"Name": "Warren M.J.", "AuthorID": "7202137554", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Industrial Biotechnology Centre, School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "34971572300": {"Name": "Mantell J.", "AuthorID": "34971572300", "AffiliationID": "124796653", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Bioimaging Facility, Medical Sciences Building, University Walk"}, "6701641490": {"Name": "Verkade P.", "AuthorID": "6701641490", "AffiliationID": "116804446", "AffiliationName": "BrisSynBio, Life Sciences Building"}, "7004687700": {"Name": "Woolfson D.N.", "AuthorID": "7004687700", "AffiliationID": "116804446", "AffiliationName": "BrisSynBio, Life Sciences Building"}, "36847892600": {"Name": "Fletcher J.M.", "AuthorID": "36847892600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol, Cantock\u2019s Close"}, "7004314208": {"Name": "Pickersgill R.W.", "AuthorID": "7004314208", "AffiliationID": "60105356, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7202570064": {"Name": "Frank S.", "AuthorID": "7202570064", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
