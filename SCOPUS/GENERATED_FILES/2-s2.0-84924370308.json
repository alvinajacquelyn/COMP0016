All rights reserved.Depletion of crude oil resources and environmental concerns have driven a worldwide research on alternative processes for the production of commodity chemicals. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is a process for flexible production of key chemicals from synthesis gas originating from non-petroleum-based sources. Although the use of iron-based catalysts would be preferred over the widely used cobalt, manufacturing methods that prevent their fast deactivation because of sintering, carbon deposition and phase changes have proven challenging. Here we present a strategy to produce highly dispersed iron carbides embedded in a matrix of porous carbon. Very high iron loadings (>40wt %) are achieved while maintaining an optimal dispersion of the active iron carbide phase when a metal organic framework is used as catalyst precursor. The unique iron spatial confinement and the absence of large iron particles in the obtained solids minimize catalyst deactivation, resulting in high active and stable operation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924370308", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"24391388700": {"Name": "Santos V.P.", "AuthorID": "24391388700", "AffiliationID": "60013869", "AffiliationName": "Core R and D, Dow Benelux B.V."}, "55328836500": {"Name": "Wezendonk T.A.", "AuthorID": "55328836500", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "36728065200": {"Name": "Nasalevich M.A.", "AuthorID": "36728065200", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "23986335600": {"Name": "Sartipi S.", "AuthorID": "23986335600", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "56542017400": {"Name": "Sun X.", "AuthorID": "56542017400", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "56075045300": {"Name": "Hakeem A.A.", "AuthorID": "56075045300", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "36051106500": {"Name": "Kapteijn F.", "AuthorID": "36051106500", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "7005226033": {"Name": "Makkee M.", "AuthorID": "7005226033", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "23097538200": {"Name": "Gascon J.", "AuthorID": "23097538200", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Catalysis Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, Delft University of Technology"}, "55566685400": {"Name": "Chojecki A.", "AuthorID": "55566685400", "AffiliationID": "60013869", "AffiliationName": "Core R and D, Dow Benelux B.V."}, "15744582200": {"Name": "Meima G.R.", "AuthorID": "15744582200", "AffiliationID": "60013869", "AffiliationName": "Hydrocarbons R and D, Dow Benelux B.V."}, "7202829648": {"Name": "Ja\u00e9n J.J.D.", "AuthorID": "7202829648", "AffiliationID": "60016476", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Ciencia de Los Materiales e Ingenier\u00eda Metal\u00fargica y Qu\u00edmica Inorg\u00e1nica, Universidad de C\u00e1diz, Campus R\u00edo San Pedro"}, "57212559119": {"Name": "Dugulan A.I.", "AuthorID": "57212559119", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Fundamental Aspects of Materials and Energy Group, Delft University of Technology"}, "55683301600": {"Name": "Islam H.U.", "AuthorID": "55683301600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "14419974700": {"Name": "Koeken A.C.J.", "AuthorID": "14419974700", "AffiliationID": "60013869", "AffiliationName": "Hydrocarbons R and D, Dow Benelux B.V."}, "6602811329": {"Name": "Ruitenbeek M.", "AuthorID": "6602811329", "AffiliationID": "60013869", "AffiliationName": "Hydrocarbons R and D, Dow Benelux B.V."}, "16066617100": {"Name": "Davidian T.", "AuthorID": "16066617100", "AffiliationID": "60013869", "AffiliationName": "Hydrocarbons R and D, Dow Benelux B.V."}}}
