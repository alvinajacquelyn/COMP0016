During their migration, PGCs move passively by morphogenetic movement of the embryo or move actively through signaling molecules. To uncover the underlying mechanism of first-phase PGC migration toward the germinal crescent in chickens, we investigated the spatial and temporal action of PGCs during primitive streak formation. Exogenously transplanted PGCs migrated toward the anterior region of the embryo and the embryonic gonads when they were transplanted into the subgerminal cavity, but not into the posterior marginal zone, in Eyal-Giladi and Kochav stage X embryos. These results indicate that for passive migration toward the anterior region the initial location of PGCs should be the central region. Notably, although PGCs and DF-1 cells migrated passively toward the anterior region, only PGCs migrated to the germinal crescent, where endogenous PGCs mainly reside, by active movement. In a live-imaging experiment with green fluorescence protein-expressing transgenic embryos, exogenous PGCs demonstrated markedly faster migration when they reached the anterior one-third of the embryo, while somatic cells showed epiblast movement with constant speed. Also, migrating PGCs exhibited successive contraction and expansion indicating their active migration. Our results suggest that chicken PGCs use sequential passive and active forces to migrate toward the germinal crescent.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Movement", "Chick Embryo", "Germ Cells", "Gonads"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921296669", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Embryology", "MEDI", "2710"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36632287300": {"Name": "Kang K.", "AuthorID": "36632287300", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "8080313300": {"Name": "Lee H.", "AuthorID": "8080313300", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "56590411300": {"Name": "Kim H.", "AuthorID": "56590411300", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "56484903100": {"Name": "Lee H.", "AuthorID": "56484903100", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "56554503600": {"Name": "Kim Y.", "AuthorID": "56554503600", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "57196309213": {"Name": "Lee H.", "AuthorID": "57196309213", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "56484866100": {"Name": "Park Y.", "AuthorID": "56484866100", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "56814078900": {"Name": "Yang S.", "AuthorID": "56814078900", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "7406440402": {"Name": "Han J.", "AuthorID": "7406440402", "AffiliationID": "60120231, 60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, Seoul National University"}, "22836159100": {"Name": "Rengaraj D.", "AuthorID": "22836159100", "AffiliationID": "60014237", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Science and Technology, Chung-Ang University"}, "15749503900": {"Name": "Park T.", "AuthorID": "15749503900", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of International Agricultural Technology, Institute of Green-Bio Science and Technology, Seoul National University"}}}
