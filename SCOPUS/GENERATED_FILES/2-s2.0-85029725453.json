Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Introduction: Highly effective, combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is now available. Current cure rates are close to 100% and applicable to all patients irrespective of race, age, severity of liver disease or viral genotype. Remarkably for persistent infection, current treatment is recommended for as little as 12 weeks; recent studies suggest even shorter courses. In contrast to interferon-based therapy, present regimens have few side effects and serious adverse events are rare. The success and safety of these regimens has stimulated interest in the possible eventual elimination of HCV. Barriers to elimination include cost of drugs and finding patients in the community less likely to interact with medical services who are a potential reservoir of infection. Sources of data: Pubmed. Areas of agreement: Antiviral agents already available are highly effective. Areas of controversy: The cost of the newer antiviral agents is very high, restricting treatment numbers in the UK in 2015/16 and focusing therapy on those patients with significant fibrosis. Recently, patients with less severe disease have been offered therapy, but delivery may be slowed by high costs. Many believe that insufficient pressure has been brought to bear to reduce costs. Eventual elimination will depend first on reducing treatment costs for those known to have chronic HCV infection and then finding patients in the community with infection unaware of their illness or reluctant/ unable to engage with medical services. Areas for developing research: Determining the most effective strategies to identify 'invisible' patients in the community with chronic HCV infection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["eradication", "hepatitis C virus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiviral Agents", "Disease Eradication", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Forecasting", "Goals", "Hepacivirus", "Hepatitis C, Chronic", "Humans", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029725453", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"11239846000": {"Name": "Gelson W.", "AuthorID": "11239846000", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15732485400": {"Name": "Alexander G.", "AuthorID": "15732485400", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital Trust"}}}
