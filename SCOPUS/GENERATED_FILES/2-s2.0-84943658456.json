Active vitamin D (1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; 1,25(OH)2D3) up-regulates CD4+ T-cell expression of the purine ectonucleotidase CD39, a molecule that is associated with the generation of anti-inflammatory adenosine. Here we aimed to investigate the direct impact of 1,25(OH)2D3 on expression of the downstream ecto-5\u2032-nucleotidase CD73 by human CD4 T cells, and components of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) pathway, which have been implicated in the modulation of CD73 by murine T cells. At 10-8 to 10-7 m, 1,25(OH)2D3 significantly increased expression of CD73 on peripheral human CD4+ T cells. Although 1,25(OH)2D3 did not affect the mRNA expression of latent TGF-\u03b21, 1,25(OH)2D3 did up-regulate expression of TGF-\u03b2-associated molecules [latency-associated peptide (LAP), glycophorin A repetitions predominant (GARP), GP96, neuropilin-1, thrombospondin-1 and \u03b1v integrin] which is likely to have contributed to the observed enhancement in TGF-\u03b2 bioactivity. CD73 was highly co-expressed with LAP and GARP following 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment, but unexpectedly, each of these cell surface molecules was expressed primarily on CD4+ Foxp3- T cells, rather than CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells. Notably, neutralization of TGF-\u03b2 significantly impaired 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated induction of CD73. Collectively, we show that 1,25(OH)2D3 enhances expression of CD73 on CD4+ Foxp3- T cells in a process that is at least partially TGF-\u03b2-dependent. These data reveal an additional contributing mechanism by which vitamin D may be protective in immune-mediated disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3", "CD73", "Foxp3", "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2"], "IndexKeywords": ["5'-Nucleotidase", "Calcitriol", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Forkhead Transcription Factors", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Membrane Proteins", "RNA, Messenger", "Transforming Growth Factor beta1", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943658456", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56181466600": {"Name": "Mann E.", "AuthorID": "56181466600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Asthma-UK Centre for Allergic Mechanisms in Asthma, King's College London"}, "36625044000": {"Name": "Chambers E.", "AuthorID": "36625044000", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Asthma-UK Centre for Allergic Mechanisms in Asthma, King's College London"}, "56457827400": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "56457827400", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Asthma-UK Centre for Allergic Mechanisms in Asthma, King's College London"}, "57198025978": {"Name": "Richards D.", "AuthorID": "57198025978", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Asthma-UK Centre for Allergic Mechanisms in Asthma, King's College London"}, "7004126309": {"Name": "Hawrylowicz C.", "AuthorID": "7004126309", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Asthma-UK Centre for Allergic Mechanisms in Asthma, King's College London"}}}
