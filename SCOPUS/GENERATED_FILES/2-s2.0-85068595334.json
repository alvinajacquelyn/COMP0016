This paper considers the terms of such interventions and the market-like relations these terms pre-suppose. It does so through a comparison of two interventions: a market-based scheme to address concerns regarding electronic waste and a Social Impact Bond for children at-risk of going into care. Ideas from Science and Technology Studies are drawn on to explore the composition of market-based interventions, the terms established through accountability devices which decide on who and what gets to participate, and the consequences that follow.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accountability devices", "electronic waste", "market-based interventions", "Science and Technology Studies", "Social Impact Bonds"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068595334", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"6507263837": {"Name": "Neyland D.", "AuthorID": "6507263837", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Sociology Department, Goldsmiths, University of London"}, "57160849000": {"Name": "Ehrenstein V.", "AuthorID": "57160849000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Advanced Studies, South Wing, University College London"}, "55572529900": {"Name": "Milyaeva S.", "AuthorID": "55572529900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "SPAIS, Bristol University"}}}
