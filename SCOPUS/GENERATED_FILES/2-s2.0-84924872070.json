Methods: Serial VA and injection data for all treatment-naive patients receiving their first intravitreal injections of ranibizumab for nAMD in the Gloucestershire National Health Service Ophthalmology department between 2008 and 2010 were extracted from an electronic medical record system. Results: The prevalence of blindness (VA in the better-seeing eye \u226425 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters) at the time of first intravitreal injection was 0.8%, increasing to 3.5% after 3 years. The prevalence of sight impairment (VA in the better-seeing eye 26-39 ETDRS letters) increased from 4.1% at baseline to 5.5% after 3 years. The incidence of initiating ranibizumab treatment for nAMD in people aged \u226550 years in Gloucestershire was 111 people per 100 000 population in 2009, and 97 people in 2010. The incidence of patients meeting the visual criteria for blindness and sight impairment registration from treated nAMD in people aged \u226550 years in Gloucestershire was 3.5 and 9.7 people, respectively per 100 000 population in 2010. Conclusion: This is the first real-world study on the incidence and prevalence of eligibility for blindness and sight impairment registration in treated nAMD in the UK based on VA data. The incidence and prevalence of eligibility for certification of blindness or sight impairment in patients treated with ranibizumab for nAMD is low in Gloucestershire, with only 3.6% of the incident population progressing to blindness in 2010.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Blindness", "Female", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Incidence", "Intravitreal Injections", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Ranibizumab", "Registries", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Vision, Low", "Visual Acuity", "Visually Impaired Persons", "Wet Macular Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924872070", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"56553904200": {"Name": "Buckle M.", "AuthorID": "56553904200", "AffiliationID": "60002465, 60021179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cheltenham Hospital"}, "15923394600": {"Name": "Mohamed Q.", "AuthorID": "15923394600", "AffiliationID": "60002465, 60021179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cheltenham Hospital"}, "24385320600": {"Name": "Fletcher E.", "AuthorID": "24385320600", "AffiliationID": "60002465, 60021179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cheltenham Hospital"}, "14830758300": {"Name": "Sallam A.", "AuthorID": "14830758300", "AffiliationID": "60002465, 60021179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cheltenham Hospital"}, "56226320400": {"Name": "Healy R.", "AuthorID": "56226320400", "AffiliationID": "60002465, 60021179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cheltenham Hospital"}, "7403678474": {"Name": "Johnston R.L.", "AuthorID": "7403678474", "AffiliationID": "60002465, 60021179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cheltenham Hospital"}, "26635526200": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "26635526200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Medical Retina Department, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7004857575": {"Name": "Stratton I.", "AuthorID": "7004857575", "AffiliationID": "60002465", "AffiliationName": "Gloucester Diabetic Retinopathy Research Group, Cheltenham General Hospital"}}}
