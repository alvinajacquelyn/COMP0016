Materials and methods Three hundred 18 F-FECH PET/CT scans were evaluated prospectively. The low-dose CT features of all cases were categorized as isodense, sclerotic, lytic or mixed lytic/sclerotic and maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) values were calculated. Findings on 18 F-FECH PET/CT were correlated with Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate planar bone scans and serum prostate-specific antigen. Results Patient age range was 50-90 years (median 71 years) and prostate-specific antigen values were in the range 0.04-372 ng/ml (Roche Modular method). Seventy-two lesions were detected on 18 F-FECH PET/CT in 45 patients, including 31 (43%) in the pelvis, 17 (23%) in the spine (cervical 3, thoracic 8 and lumbar spine 6) and 10 (13%) in the ribs. Evaluation of low-dose CT in combination with PET helped to characterize benign findings in 21 (29%) lesions. The SUV max for all except one benign lesion ranged from 0.49 to 2.15. In 51 (71%) lesions because of metastatic disease, SUV max was 0.6-11.6 for those classified as sclerotic on low-dose CT, 0.7-8.58 for lytic lesions, 1.1-7.65 for isodense lesions and 1.27-3.53 for mixed lytic/sclerotic lesions. Of the 56 18 F-FECH-avid lesions, 21 lesions showed avidity on bone scan [3 (23%) of the 13 isodense lesions, 14 (40%) of the 35 sclerotic lesions, 2 (50%) of the lytic lesions and 2 (50%) of the mixed sclerotic/lytic lesions]. Conclusion 18 F-FECH PET/CT identified bone lesions in 15% of patients with suspected prostate cancer relapse. SUV max in isolation cannot be used to characterize these lesions as benign or malignant. Minimal overlap of benign and malignant lesions was observed above SUV max of 2.5. Low-dose CT of PET/CT is a useful tool to aid characterization.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18 F-fluoroethylcholine", "choline PET", "PET/CT", "skeletal metastases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Bone Neoplasms", "Choline", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Prostate-Specific Antigen", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Recurrence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017149805", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55695155900": {"Name": "Haroon A.", "AuthorID": "55695155900", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Barts Health NHS Trust, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "8960246900": {"Name": "Syed R.", "AuthorID": "8960246900", "AffiliationID": "118410726", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "23027243700": {"Name": "Endozo R.", "AuthorID": "23027243700", "AffiliationID": "118410726", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "55756913100": {"Name": "Allie R.", "AuthorID": "55756913100", "AffiliationID": "118410726", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "118410726", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
