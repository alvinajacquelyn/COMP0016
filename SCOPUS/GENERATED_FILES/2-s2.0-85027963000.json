Using Wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (respondents aged 24\u201332, N = 14,334), we ran multivariate logistic regressions to estimate the probability of reporting trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, and short sleep duration, based on specific sexual orientation categories. Results after controlling for mental health indicate that these categories are more likely to have trouble falling asleep: women who identify as \u201cbisexual\u201d (OR = 1.85, CI: 1.21,2.82), women attracted to \u201cboth sexes\u201d (OR = 1.31, CI: 1.00,1.72), women who have had \u201cmostly opposite sex\u201d partners (OR = 1.40, CI: 1.10,1.77), and men who have had \u201cmostly same sex\u201d partners (OR = 2.28, CI: 1.21,4.31). For trouble staying asleep: women who identify as \u201cbisexual\u201d (OR = 1.48, CI: 1.01,2.18), men and women attracted to \u201cboth sexes\u201d (OR = 1.81, CI: 1.12,2.91; OR = 1.27, CI: 1.00,1.60), and women who have had \u201cmostly opposite sex partners\u201d (OR = 1.38, CI: 1.13,1.69). For short sleep duration: women who identify as \u201cmostly straight\u201d or \u201cmostly gay\u201d (OR = 1.27, CI: 1.01,1.60; OR = 2.64, CI: 1.36,5.14), men who identify as \u201cbisexual\u201d (OR = 2.56, CI: 1.26,5.18), women attracted only to \u201csame sex\u201d (OR = 2.42, CI: 1.48,3.96), men attracted to \u201cboth sexes\u201d (OR = 1.88, CI: 1.21,2.93), and women who have had \u201cmostly same sex\u201d partners (OR = 4.90, CI: 2.10,11.46). Given the variation in findings, it is necessary to analyze each sexual orientation dimension and the categories within each dimension to adequately understand sleep disturbances among sexual minority populations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027963000", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57195417270": {"Name": "Fricke J.", "AuthorID": "57195417270", "AffiliationID": "60010307", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health and Behavioral Sciences, University of Colorado Denver"}, "37665949300": {"Name": "Sironi M.", "AuthorID": "37665949300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Science, University College London"}}}
