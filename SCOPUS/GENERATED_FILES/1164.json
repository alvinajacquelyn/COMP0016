Adults aged 45\u201359 years from four UK general practices were randomly assigned to receive standard information (\u2018The Facts\u2019, n = 2,216) versus standard information plus \u2018The Gist\u2019 leaflet (Gist + Facts, n = 2,236). Questionnaires were returned by 964/4,452 individuals (22 %). 82 % of respondents reported having read the information, but those with poor numeracy were less likely (74 vs. 88 %, p < .001). The \u2018Gist + Facts\u2019 group were more likely to reach the criterion for adequate knowledge (95 vs. 91 %; p < .01), but this was not moderated by numeracy. Most respondents (98 %) intended to participate in screening, with no group differences and no interaction with numeracy. The improved levels of knowledge and self-reported reading suggest \u2018The Gist\u2019 leaflet may increase engagement with colorectal cancer screening, but ceiling effects reduced the likelihood that screening intentions would be affected.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colorectal cancer", "Fuzzy-Trace Theory", "Gist", "Health communication", "Numeracy", "Screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Female", "Fuzzy Logic", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Intention", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Education as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925541427", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55501030300": {"Name": "Smith S.G.", "AuthorID": "55501030300", "AffiliationID": "60013227, 60007363", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Internal Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "23029251000": {"Name": "von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35239316000": {"Name": "Wolf M.S.", "AuthorID": "35239316000", "AffiliationID": "60013227, 60007363", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Internal Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University"}, "7005610240": {"Name": "Raine R.", "AuthorID": "7005610240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "26635766600": {"Name": "Obichere A.", "AuthorID": "26635766600", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (NHS) Hospital (UCLH) NHS Trust"}}}
