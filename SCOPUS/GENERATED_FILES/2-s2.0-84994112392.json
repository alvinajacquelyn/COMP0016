NCL result from the excessive accumulation of neuronal and extraneuronal lipopigments, despite having diverse underlying biochemical aetiologies. Here we review the clinical presentation, pathophysiology and genetics of these conditions as well as the approach to diagnosis and management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Batten", "Haltia-Santavuori", "Jansk\u00fd-Bielschowsky", "progressive myoclonus epilepsies", "Spielmeyer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Neuronal Ceroid-Lipofuscinoses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994112392", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57195992460": {"Name": "Nita D.A.", "AuthorID": "57195992460", "AffiliationID": "60085584, 60016849, 60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, and Center for Brain and Mental Health, Sick Kids Research Institute"}, "7004098060": {"Name": "Minassian B.A.", "AuthorID": "7004098060", "AffiliationID": "60085584, 60016849, 60030319", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, and Center for Brain and Mental Health, Sick Kids Research Institute"}, "7005160390": {"Name": "Mole S.E.", "AuthorID": "7005160390", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, UCL Institute of Child Health and Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
