An increased number of senescent cells are associated with age-related tissue degeneration during NAFLD-induced HCC, or during chemotherapeutic treatment. Senolytic agents target selectively senescent cells. A combination of the senolytic drugs dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) reduced hepatic lipid accumulation and alleviated age-associated physical dysfunction in mice. However, whether D+Q can impact the treatment of HCC, at the end-stage of the NAFLD inflammatory spectrum, is unknown. Here, using two well-established HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh-7), we demonstrate that the maximal cytostatic doses for D and/or Q (1 + 1 \u03bcM) lacked efficacy in removing doxorubicin-induced \u03b2-gal-positive senescent cells. Moreover, D+Q did not affect doxorubicin-dependent induction of flattened morphology, activation of p16, expression of SASP-associated genes or formation of \u03b3H2AX foci. We then investigated the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin, D+Q, or the combination, in xenograft studies conducted with HCC cells inoculated in athymic nude mice. Doxorubicin reduced tumor growth by 30% compared to control mice, while D+Q was ineffective in synergizing with doxorubicin and in clearing doxorubicin-induced HCC senescent cells. Unexpectedly, D+Q alone appeared to have acute pro-tumorigenic effects in control mice. While our data need to be confirmed in animal models that fully recapitulate NAFLD, we demonstrate that these compounds are ineffective, alone or in synergy with senescence-inducing chemotherapy, against experimental HCC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dasatinib", "HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma)", "NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)", "Quercertin", "Senolytic agents"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061031003", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57207938556": {"Name": "Kovacovicova K.", "AuthorID": "57207938556", "AffiliationID": "113394490", "AffiliationName": "International Clinical Research Center, FNUSA, ICRC"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "56040760500": {"Name": "Skolnaja M.", "AuthorID": "56040760500", "AffiliationID": "120099705", "AffiliationName": "IVEX Lab"}, "57207938963": {"Name": "Heinmaa M.", "AuthorID": "57207938963", "AffiliationID": "60068861", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Tallinn University of Technology"}, "55240402200": {"Name": "Pata P.", "AuthorID": "55240402200", "AffiliationID": "120099705", "AffiliationName": "IVEX Lab"}, "6603542144": {"Name": "Pata I.", "AuthorID": "6603542144", "AffiliationID": "120099705", "AffiliationName": "IVEX Lab"}, "57212783801": {"Name": "Mistrik M.", "AuthorID": "57212783801", "AffiliationID": "60003367", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Institute of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Palacky University"}, "7103077558": {"Name": "Bartek J.", "AuthorID": "7103077558", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Translational Medicine and Chemical Biology, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute"}}}
