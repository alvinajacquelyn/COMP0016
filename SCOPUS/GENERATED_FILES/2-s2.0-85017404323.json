Here, we describe two independent families affected by CHM bearing a mutation outside the gene's coding region at position c.-98: C>A and C>T, which segregated with the disease. The male proband of family 1 was found to lack CHM mRNA and its gene product Rab escort protein 1, whereas whole-genome sequencing of an affected male in family 2 excluded the involvement of any other known retinal genes. Both mutations abrogated luciferase activity when inserted into a reporter construct, and by further employing the luciferase reporter system to assay sequences 5\u2032 to the gene, we identified the CHM promoter as the region encompassing nucleotides c.-119 to c.-76. These findings suggest that the CHM promoter region should be examined in patients with CHM who lack coding sequence mutations, and reveals, for the first time, features of the gene's regulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CHM", "choroideremia", "promoter", "REP-1", "THAP11", "ZNF143"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Choroideremia", "Female", "Genetic Diseases, X-Linked", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Pedigree", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Retina", "Retinal Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017404323", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"35741598600": {"Name": "Radziwon A.", "AuthorID": "35741598600", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Alberta"}, "35477245200": {"Name": "MacDonald I.M.", "AuthorID": "35477245200", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Alberta"}, "6508145987": {"Name": "Arno G.", "AuthorID": "6508145987", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57193883717": {"Name": "K.
