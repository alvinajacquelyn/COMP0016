Changes in host gene expression in response to infection may occur in any part of the body, with the continuous interaction between blood and tissues allowing blood cells to act as biosensors for the changes. In this study we have used whole blood transcriptome profiling to systematically identify signatures and the pathway biology underlying the pathogenesis of neonatal infection. Blood samples were collected from neonates at the first clinical signs of suspected sepsis alongside age matched healthy control subjects. Here we report a detailed description of the study design, including clinical data collected, experimental methods used and data analysis workflows and which correspond with data in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets (GSE25504). Our data set has allowed identification of a patient invariant 52-gene classifier that predicts bacterial infection with high accuracy and lays the foundation for advancing diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies for neonatal sepsis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gene expression profiling", "Microarray", "Neonatal sepsis", "Whole blood"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922902328", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57189381594": {"Name": "Dickinson P.", "AuthorID": "57189381594", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SynthSys-Synthetic and Systems Biology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7005835546": {"Name": "Forster T.", "AuthorID": "7005835546", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SynthSys-Synthetic and Systems Biology, University of Edinburgh"}, "23008246800": {"Name": "Craigon M.", "AuthorID": "23008246800", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Pathway Medicine, Edinburgh Infectious Diseases, University of Edinburgh"}, "7402567635": {"Name": "Ross A.J.", "AuthorID": "7402567635", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Pathway Medicine, Edinburgh Infectious Diseases, University of Edinburgh"}, "36196573000": {"Name": "Khondoker M.R.", "AuthorID": "36196573000", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60171762, 60028884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Institute of Psychiatry and NIHR, Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust King's College"}, "57193874267": {"Name": "Lacaze P.", "AuthorID": "57193874267", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Pathway Medicine, Edinburgh Infectious Diseases, University of Edinburgh"}, "7005878579": {"Name": "Ghazal P.", "AuthorID": "7005878579", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "SynthSys-Synthetic and Systems Biology, University of Edinburgh"}, "35235008800": {"Name": "Smith C.L.", "AuthorID": "35235008800", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60002975", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Simpson Centre for Reproductive Health, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "55418725100": {"Name": "Orme J.", "AuthorID": "55418725100", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60002975", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Simpson Centre for Reproductive Health, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "57198786127": {"Name": "Jackson A.", "AuthorID": "57198786127", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60002975", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Simpson Centre for Reproductive Health, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "7003306775": {"Name": "Stenson B.J.", "AuthorID": "7003306775", "AffiliationID": "60028299, 60002975", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Unit, Simpson Centre for Reproductive Health, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "35393053000": {"Name": "Ivens A.", "AuthorID": "35393053000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Infection Immunity and Evolution, University of Edinburgh"}, "55684156300": {"Name": "Lynn D.J.", "AuthorID": "55684156300", "AffiliationID": "60108899", "AffiliationName": "EMBL Australia Laboratory, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute"}, "35473319600": {"Name": "Flanagan K.L.", "AuthorID": "35473319600", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Monash University"}}}
