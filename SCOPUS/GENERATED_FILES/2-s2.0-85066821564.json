Background: Atrial ischemia due to procedural-related coronary atrial branch occlusion in elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been associated with atrial arrhythmias. Its role in a STEMI scenario is unknown. Methods: STEMI patients treated with primary PCI were classified according to the loss or patency of an atrial branch at the end of the procedure. The occurrence of atrial arrhythmias was documented on 24-hr Holter-ECG at 3 and 6 months or on ECG during 1-year follow-up visits. Results: Of 900 patients, 355 (age 61 \u00b1 12 years, 79% male) underwent primary PCI involving the origin of an atrial branch. Procedural-related coronary atrial branch occlusion was observed in 18 (5%) individuals). During 1-year follow-up, 33% of patients with procedural-related atrial branch occlusion presented atrial arrhythmias, as compared with 55% in those with a patent atrial branch (p =.088). Age, no previous history of myocardial infarction, and a reduced flow in the culprit vessel were the only independent correlates of atrial arrhythmias. Conclusions: The frequency of procedural-related atrial branch occlusion during primary PCI is low (5%) and is not associated with increased frequency of atrial arrhythmias at 1-year follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coronary artery disease", "coronary atrial branch", "infarction", "percutaneous intervention", "side branch occlusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Coronary Occlusion", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction", "Tachycardia, Supraventricular", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066821564", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55255187600": {"Name": "Montero Cabezas J.M.", "AuthorID": "55255187600", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56815182900": {"Name": "Abou R.", "AuthorID": "56815182900", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "57188633108": {"Name": "Goedemans L.", "AuthorID": "57188633108", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "7007083597": {"Name": "Schalij M.J.", "AuthorID": "7007083597", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "57201410369": {"Name": "Ajmone Marsan N.", "AuthorID": "57201410369", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "55429494700": {"Name": "Bax J.J.", "AuthorID": "55429494700", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "24172709900": {"Name": "Delgado V.", "AuthorID": "24172709900", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "15052868400": {"Name": "Ag\u00fcero J.", "AuthorID": "15052868400", "AffiliationID": "118354380", "AffiliationName": "CIBER de enfermedades CardioVasculares (CIBERCV)"}, "7202675508": {"Name": "Fuster V.", "AuthorID": "7202675508", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}, "13907649300": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez B.", "AuthorID": "13907649300", "AffiliationID": "60019290", "AffiliationName": "IIS-Fundaci\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez D\u00edaz University Hospital"}}}
