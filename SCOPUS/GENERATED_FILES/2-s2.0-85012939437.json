We aimed to investigate the relation between QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) conversion interferon-\u03b3 values and risk of subsequent active tuberculosis disease and of QFT reversion. Methods We analysed data from a reported vaccine efficacy trial of the tuberculosis vaccine MVA85A in South Africa. QFT negative, HIV uninfected young children aged 18\u201324 weeks were enrolled. We stratified participants by quantitative QFT result (interferon-\u03b3 <0\u00b735 IU/mL, 0\u00b735\u20134\u00b700 IU/mL, and >4\u00b700 IU/mL) at the intermediate study visit (day 336) and determined risk of progression to active tuberculosis disease over the subsequent 6\u201324 months. No QFT differences were observed between placebo and MVA85A groups at day 336 or end of study; therefore, both groups were included in analyses. Study clinicians were not masked to QFT values, but strict case definitions were used that excluded QFT results. We used generalised additive models to evaluate the quantitative relation between day 336 QFT value and subsequent disease risk, and we compared disease rates between QFT strata using a two-sample Poisson test. Findings Among 2512 young children with QFT tests done at day 336, 172 (7%) were positive; 87 (7%) of 1267 in placebo group and 85 (7%) of 1245 in the MVA85A group (p=1\u00b700). Compared with QFT non-converters (tuberculosis disease incidence 0\u00b77 per 100 person-years [95% CI 0\u00b74\u20131\u00b71]), children with QFT conversion at interferon-\u03b3 values between 0\u00b735\u20134\u00b700 IU/mL did not have significantly increased risk of disease (2\u00b75 per 100 person-years [95% CI 0\u00b74\u20139\u00b74]; incidence rate ratio (IRR) 3\u00b77 (95% CI 0\u00b74\u201315\u00b78; p=0\u00b723). However, QFT conversion at interferon-\u03b3 values higher than 4\u00b700 IU/mL was associated with substantially increased disease incidence (28\u00b70 per 100 person-years [95% CI 14\u00b79\u201345\u00b77]) compared with non-converters (IRR 42\u00b75 [95% CI 17\u00b72\u201399\u00b77]; p<0\u00b70001), and compared with children with interferon-\u03b3 values between 0\u00b735\u20134\u00b700 IU/mL (IRR 11\u00b74 [95% CI 2\u00b74\u2013107\u00b72]; p=0\u00b700047). Among 91 QFT converters who were given a repeat test, 53 (58%) reverted from positive to negative. QFT reversion risk was inversely associated with interferon-\u03b3 value at QFT conversion and was highest with interferon-\u03b3 values less than 4\u00b700 IU/mL (47 [77%] of 61). Interpretation In young children, tuberculosis disease risk was not significantly increased, and QFT reversion was common, following QFT conversion at interferon-\u03b3 values up to 10 times the recommended test threshold (0\u00b735 IU/mL). By contrast, QFT conversion at very high interferon-\u03b3 values (>4\u00b700 IU/mL) warrants intensified diagnostic and preventive intervention because of the extremely high risk of tuberculosis disease in these young children.
