The majority of refugees and migrants were rescued in the Central Mediterranean and disembarked at ports in the Sicily region. Rapid on-spot active TB screening intervention at the point of arrival will cover most migrants arriving in EU and by detecting TB prevalent cases will limit further transmission of the disease. Material and methods Between November 2016 and December 2017 newly arrived migrants at point of arrivals in Sicily, were screened for active Tuberculosis using a smartphone application, followed in symptomatic individuals by fast molecular test, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, on collected sputum samples. Results In the study period 3787 migrants received a medical evaluation. Eight hundred and ninety-one (23.5%) reported at least one protocol-defined Tuberculosis symptom. Fifteen (2.7%) were positive to at least one microbiological test revealing a post-entry screening prevalence rate of 396 per 100.000 individuals screened (95% CI: 2.22\u20136.53). In logistic regression analysis, those with cough and at least one other symptom had an increased probability of testing positive compared to persons with symptoms other than cough. Whole-genome-sequencing demonstrate two separate cases of transmission. Discussion To our knowledge this study reports first-time results of an active TB case finding strategy based on on-spot symptom screening using a smartphone application, followed by fast molecular test on collected sputum samples. Our preliminary findings reveal a post-entry screening prevalence rate of 396 per 100.000 individuals screened (95% CI: 2.22\u20136.53).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Mobile Applications", "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Prevalence", "Sicily", "Sputum", "Transients and Migrants", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069267898", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189364989": {"Name": "Barcellini L.", "AuthorID": "57189364989", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "14059423200": {"Name": "Borroni E.", "AuthorID": "14059423200", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "57217928249": {"Name": "Stancanelli G.", "AuthorID": "57217928249", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "7005158262": {"Name": "Cirillo D.M.", "AuthorID": "7005158262", "AffiliationID": "60082964", "AffiliationName": "Emerging Bacterial Pathogens Unit, Division of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "26535709700": {"Name": "Cimaglia C.", "AuthorID": "26535709700", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Unit, National Institute for Infectious Disease \u201cLazzaro Spallanzani\u201d, IRCCS"}, "57203678240": {"Name": "Girardi E.", "AuthorID": "57203678240", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epidemiology Unit, National Institute for Infectious Disease \u201cLazzaro Spallanzani\u201d, IRCCS"}, "7006442223": {"Name": "Matteelli A.", "AuthorID": "7006442223", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious and Tropical Diseases,, Infectious Disease, University of Brescia"}, "56763914000": {"Name": "Marchese V.", "AuthorID": "56763914000", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infectious and Tropical Diseases,, Infectious Disease, University of Brescia"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60000733", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Section, Health Protection Agency Colindale and University College London"}}}
