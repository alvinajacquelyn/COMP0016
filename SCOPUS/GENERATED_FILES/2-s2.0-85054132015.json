An extensive genetic toolkit for neural circuit dissection, and well-developed neural recording technology, make the mouse a powerful model organism for systems neuroscience. However, most methods for high-bandwidth acquisition of behavioral data in mice rely upon fixed-position cameras and other off-animal devices, complicating the monitoring of animals freely engaged in natural behaviors. Here, we report the development of a lightweight head-mounted camera system combined with head-movement sensors to simultaneously monitor eye position, pupil dilation, whisking, and pinna movements along with head motion in unrestrained, freely behaving mice. The power of the combined technology is demonstrated by observations linking eye position to head orientation; whisking to non-tactile stimulation; and, in electrophysiological experiments, visual cortical activity to volitional head movements. Meyer et al. describe a new head-mounted camera system that enables detailed behavioral monitoring along with neural recording in freely moving mice. The system reveals close coupling between eye and head movements, and head-movement-related activity in primary visual cortex.", "AuthorKeywords": ["eye movement", "head movement", "natural behavior", "oculomotor", "pinna", "pupil", "vestibular", "visual cortex", "whisker"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Electrophysiology", "Eye Movement Measurements", "Head", "Head Movements", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Movement", "Vibrissae", "Video Recording", "Visual Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054132015", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"37019659700": {"Name": "Meyer A.F.", "AuthorID": "37019659700", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London (UCL)"}, "7005205264": {"Name": "Sahani M.", "AuthorID": "7005205264", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London (UCL)"}, "26027663300": {"Name": "Poort J.", "AuthorID": "26027663300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, UCL"}, "35478840000": {"Name": "O'Keefe J.", "AuthorID": "35478840000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, UCL"}, "57204347332": {"Name": "Linden J.F.", "AuthorID": "57204347332", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, UCL"}}}
