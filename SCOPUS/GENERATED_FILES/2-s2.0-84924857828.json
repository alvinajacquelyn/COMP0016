The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We show that in the anticenter region, between Galactic longitudes of 110\u00b0 < l < 229\u00b0, there is an oscillating asymmetry in the main-sequence star counts on either side of the Galactic plane using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. This asymmetry oscillates from more stars in the north at distances of about 2 kpc from the Sun to more stars in the south at 4-6 kpc from the Sun to more stars in the north at distances of 8-10 kpc from the Sun. We also see evidence that there are more stars in the south at distances of 12-16 kpc from the Sun. The three more distant asymmetries form roughly concentric rings around the Galactic center, opening in the direction of the Milky Way's spiral arms. The northern ring, 9 kpc from the Sun, is easily identified with the previously discovered Monoceros Ring. Parts of the southern ring at 14 kpc from the Sun (which we call the TriAnd Ring) have previously been identified as related to the Monoceros Ring, and others have been called the Triangulum Andromeda Overdensity. The two nearer oscillations are approximated by a toy model in which the disk plane is offset by the order of 100 pc up and then down at different radii. We also show that the disk is not azimuthally symmetric around the Galactic anticenter and that there could be a correspondence between our observed oscillations and the spiral structure of the Galaxy. Our observations suggest that the TriAnd and Monoceros Rings (which extend to at least 25 kpc from the Galactic center) are primarily the result of disk oscillations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxy: disk", "Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics", "Galaxy: structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924857828", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57196006488": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57196006488", "AffiliationID": "60025534", "AffiliationName": "Departmentof Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}, "56938025300": {"Name": "Liu C.", "AuthorID": "56938025300", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "36072080400": {"Name": "Deng L.", "AuthorID": "36072080400", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57206368351": {"Name": "Newberg H.", "AuthorID": "57206368351", "AffiliationID": "60025534", "AffiliationName": "Departmentof Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}, "7101796766": {"Name": "Carlin J.", "AuthorID": "7101796766", "AffiliationID": "60025534", "AffiliationName": "Departmentof Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"}, "55309238700": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "55309238700", "AffiliationID": "60032168, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "26642272800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nrich R.", "AuthorID": "26642272800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Rudolf-Peierls Centre for Theoretical Physics, University of Oxford"}, "35278935800": {"Name": "Yanny B.", "AuthorID": "35278935800", "AffiliationID": "60013881", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Astrophysics Group, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory"}}}
