Limitations with autograft, allograft and synthetics have led to research into tissue engineering using scaffolds and mesenchymal stem cells. Objectives: This systematic review aims to examine and summarise the pre clinical in-vivo studies and limited clinical studies on the use of scaffolds in the treatment of ligamentous injuries Data sources: Databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of science, Medline, Cochrane library and Embase. The following key words and search terms were used: scaffolds, ligament, mesenchymal stem cells, tissue engineering, clinical, and preclinical. Methods: A total of 118 articles were reviewed. 19 articles were identified as relevant for the purpose of this systematic literature review. An additional 2 articles were sourced from the reference list of reviewed articles. Results: Three tables of studies were constructed: pre clinical biological scaffolds, pre clinical synthetic scaffolds and clinical scaffolds. Conclusions: There is a large body of pre clinical evidence that the use of scaffolds combined with mesenchymal stem cells can be a viable option in the regeneration of ligamentous structures with biological and mechanical properties suitable for function. There is, however, limited clinical evidence supporting the use of recently developed scaffolds and historical evidence of synthetic scaffolds failing in the management of anterior cruciate ligament repairs. There appears to be no consensus in the literature as to the nature of the scaffold material that is most suitable for clinical trials. No randomised control trials have yet been conducted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clinical and pre clinical", "Ligament", "Mesenchymal stem cells", "Scaffolds", "Tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Humans", "Knee", "Ligaments", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Regeneration", "Tissue Engineering", "Tissue Scaffolds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989227631", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"]], "AuthorData": {"57191369513": {"Name": "Caudwell M.", "AuthorID": "57191369513", "AffiliationID": "60084428", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, North West Regional Hospital"}, "54942917100": {"Name": "Crowley C.", "AuthorID": "54942917100", "AffiliationID": "60084428", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedics, North West Regional Hospital"}, "35229756200": {"Name": "Khan W.S.", "AuthorID": "35229756200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Orthopaedic and Musculoskeletal Sciences, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "36771985600": {"Name": "Wong J.M.L.", "AuthorID": "36771985600", "AffiliationID": "60007937, 60007800", "AffiliationName": "Queen\u2019s Hospital, Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS Trust"}}}
