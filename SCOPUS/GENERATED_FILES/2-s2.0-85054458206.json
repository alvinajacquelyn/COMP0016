This study aimed to quantify the prevalence of barriers to BSS and examine the extent to which these barriers differed according to non-participant profiles: non-responders to the BSS invitation, active decliners of the invitation, and non-attenders of confirmed appointments. Methods: Individuals invited for BSS between March 2013 and December 2015, across 28 General Practices in England, were sent a questionnaire. Questions measured initial interest in BSS, engagement with the information booklet, BSS participation, and, where applicable, reasons for BSS non-attendance. Chi-square tests of independence were performed to examine the relationship between barriers, non-participant groups and socio-demographic variables. Results: 1478 (45.8%) questionnaires were returned for analysis: 1230 (83.2%) attended screening, 114 (7.7%) were non-responders to the BSS invitation, 100 (6.8%) were active decliners, and 34 (2.3%) were non-attenders. Non-responders were less likely to have read the whole information booklet than active decliners (x 2 (2, N = 157) = 7.00, p = 0.008) and non-attenders (x 2 (2, N = 101) = 8.07, p = 0.005). Non-responders also had lower initial interest in having BSS than either active decliners (x 2 (2, N = 213) = 6.07, p = 0.014) or non-attenders (x2 (2, N = 146) = 32.93, p < 0.001). Overall, anticipated pain (33%) and embarrassment (30%) were the most commonly cited barriers to BSS participation. For non-attenders, however, practical, appointment-related reasons were most common (27%). Conclusions: Interventions to improve BSS uptake should be more nuanced and use targeted strategies to address the specific needs of each group.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bowel scope", "Colorectal cancer", "Flexible sigmoidoscopy", "Non-attendance", "Screening"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054458206", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"23029251000": {"Name": "Von Wagner C.", "AuthorID": "23029251000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57190251664": {"Name": "Bonello B.", "AuthorID": "57190251664", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60005028", "AffiliationName": "MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow"}, "56136479100": {"Name": "Stoffel S.", "AuthorID": "56136479100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57194379825": {"Name": "Skrobanski H.", "AuthorID": "57194379825", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "57193519692": {"Name": "Freeman M.", "AuthorID": "57193519692", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "56513969200": {"Name": "Kerrison R.S.", "AuthorID": "56513969200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "44361787800": {"Name": "McGregor L.M.", "AuthorID": "44361787800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
