Published by The Geological Society of London.The 26 December 2004 earthquake and tsunami had variable impacts on the Andaman and Nicobar islands. While the earthquake rupture caused land-elevation changes (uplift in the west, subsidence in the east and south) and co-seismic shaking damaged buildings and weakened the infrastucture (roads, bridges, jetties), the tsunami caused most devastation. The largely tribal-populated, low-elevation smaller islands in the Nicobars were the most affected with two islands (Katchall and Pilmillow) losing nearly 90% of their population. This chapter documents and presents new evidence of the impacts of the earthquake and tsunami.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028335196", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"56003358600": {"Name": "Carter A.", "AuthorID": "56003358600", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36944794300": {"Name": "Bandopadhyay P.C.", "AuthorID": "36944794300", "AffiliationID": "60024232", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Calcutta"}}}
