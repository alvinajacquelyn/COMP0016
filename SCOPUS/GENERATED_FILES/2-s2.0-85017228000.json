Methods: Thirty malignant lung lesions >2 cm in size (23 patients) were scanned on two occasions, using echo-planar-Diffusion-Weighted (DW)-MRI to derive whole-tumour ADC (b = 100, 500 and 800smm-2). Scanning was performed at 4 institutions (3 MRI vendors). Whole-tumour volumes-of-interest were copied from first visit onto second visit images and from one post-processing platform to an open-source platform, to assess ADC repeatability and cross-platform reproducibility. Results: Whole-tumour ADC values ranged from 0.66-1.94x10-3mm2s-1 (mean = 1.14). Within-patient coefficient-of-variation (wCV) was 7.1% (95% CI 5.7\u20139.6%), limits-of-agreement (LoA) -18.0 to 21.9%. Lesions >3 cm had improved repeatability: wCV 3.9% (95% CI 2.9\u20135.9%); and LoA -10.2 to 11.4%. Variability for lesions <3 cm was 2.46 times higher. ADC reproducibility across different post-processing platforms was excellent: Pearson\u2019s R2 = 0.99; CoV 2.8% (95% CI 2.3-3.4%); and LoA -7.4 to 8.0%. Conclusion: A free-breathing DW-MRI protocol for imaging malignant lung tumours achieved satisfactory within-patient repeatability and was robust to changes in post-processing software, justifying its use in multi-centre trials. For response evaluation in individual patients, a change in ADC >21.9% will reflect treatment-related change. Key Points: \u2022 In lung cancer, free-breathing DWI-MRI produces acceptable images with evaluable ADC measurement. \u2022 ADC repeatability coefficient-of-variation is 7.1% for lung tumours >2 cm. \u2022 ADC repeatability coefficient-of-variation is 3.9% for lung tumours >3 cm. \u2022 ADC measurement precision is unaffected by the post-processing software used. \u2022 In multicentre trials, 22% increase in ADC indicates positive treatment response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)", "Diffusion-weighted MRI", "Lung Cancer", "Repeatability", "Reproducibility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Prospective Studies", "Reproducibility of Results", "ROC Curve", "Tumor Burden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017228000", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55973968800": {"Name": "Weller A.", "AuthorID": "55973968800", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Cancer Imaging Centre, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55573414900": {"Name": "Papoutsaki M.V.", "AuthorID": "55573414900", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Cancer Imaging Centre, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35336046600": {"Name": "Blackledge M.", "AuthorID": "35336046600", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Cancer Imaging Centre, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004981356": {"Name": "deSouza N.M.", "AuthorID": "7004981356", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Cancer Imaging Centre, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003731614": {"Name": "Waterton J.C.", "AuthorID": "7003731614", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "22955689900": {"Name": "Chiti A.", "AuthorID": "22955689900", "AffiliationID": "60107210", "AffiliationName": "Humanitas University"}, "57220390835": {"Name": "Stroobants S.", "AuthorID": "57220390835", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Universiteit Antwerpen"}, "6602116889": {"Name": "Kuijer J.", "AuthorID": "6602116889", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Vrije Universiteit Medisch Centrum"}, "19337441100": {"Name": "Morgan V.", "AuthorID": "19337441100", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
