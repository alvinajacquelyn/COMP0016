Histochemistry and cytochemistry studies evidenced patterns of circadian variation of the lysosomal marker enzymes, suggesting that lysosomal function oscillates rhythmically during the 24-h day. The circadian rhythmicity of cellular processes is driven by the biological clock ticking through transcriptional/translational feedback loops hardwired by circadian genes and proteins. Malfunction of the molecular clockwork may provoke severe deregulation of downstream gene expression regulating a complex array of cellular functions leading to anatomical and functional changes. In this review we highlight that all the genes mutated in lysosomal storage disorders encode circadian transcripts suggesting a direct participation of the biological clock in the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cellular and tissue derangements hallmarking these hereditary diseases. The 24-h periodicity of oscillation of gene transcription and translation could lead in physiological conditions to circadian rhythmicity of fluctuation of enzyme levels and activity, so that gene transfer could be envisaged to reproduce 24-h periodicity of variation of enzymatic dynamics and circadian rhythmicity could have an impact on the schedule of enzyme replacement therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ataxia telangiectasia mutate", "Circadian rhythmicity", "Clock gene", "Enzyme replacement therapy", "Unfold protein response"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006061814", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (miscellaneous)", "BIOC", "1301"]], "AuthorData": {"6603848797": {"Name": "Mazzoccoli G.", "AuthorID": "6603848797", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Division of Internal Medicine and Chronobiology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences, IRCCS Scientific Institute and Regional General Hospital \u201cCasa Sollievo della Sofferenza\u201d"}, "6603555514": {"Name": "Vinciguerra M.", "AuthorID": "6603555514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "8841993000": {"Name": "Mazza T.", "AuthorID": "8841993000", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Unit, IRCCS Scientific Institute and Regional General Hospital \u201cCasa Sollievo della Sofferenza\u201d"}, "24467247900": {"Name": "Castellana S.", "AuthorID": "24467247900", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics Unit, IRCCS Scientific Institute and Regional General Hospital \u201cCasa Sollievo della Sofferenza\u201d"}, "7005691513": {"Name": "Scarpa M.", "AuthorID": "7005691513", "AffiliationID": "60070410", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rare Disorders, IRCCS Scientific Institute and Regional General Hospital \u201cCasa Sollievo della Sofferenza\u201d"}}}
