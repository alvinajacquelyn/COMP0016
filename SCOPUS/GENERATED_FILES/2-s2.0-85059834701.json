Conjugated polymers with stabilizing coordination units for single-site catalytic centers are excellent candidates to minimize the use of expensive noble metal electrode materials. In this study, conjugated metallopolymer, P OS [Cu], was synthesized and fully characterized by means of spectroscopical, electrochemical, and photophysical methods. The copper metallopolymer was found to be highly active for the electrocatalytic hydrogen generation (HER) in an aqueous solution at pH 7.4 and overpotentials at 300 mV vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Compared to the platinum electrode, the obtained overpotential is only 100 mV higher. The photoelectrochemical tests revealed that the complexation of the conjugated polymer P OS turned its intrinsically electron-accepting (p-type) properties into an electron-donor (n-type) with photocurrent responses ten times higher than the organic photoelectrode.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Copper", "Electrocatalysts", "Hydrogen evolution reaction", "Metallopolymer", "P- and n-type photoresponse", "Photocurrent"], "IndexKeywords": ["Hydrogen evolution reactions", "Hydrogen generations", "Metallopolymer", "Noble metal electrodes", "Photocurrent response", "Photoelectrochemicals", "Photoresponses", "Reversible hydrogen electrodes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059834701", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"]], "AuthorData": {"55671660900": {"Name": "Elmas S.", "AuthorID": "55671660900", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "Institute for NanoScale Science and Technology, Flinders University"}, "7402879628": {"Name": "Andersson M.", "AuthorID": "7402879628", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "Institute for NanoScale Science and Technology, Flinders University"}, "56210619300": {"Name": "Macdonald T.", "AuthorID": "56210619300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57201542468": {"Name": "Skinner W.", "AuthorID": "57201542468", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia Mawson Lakes Campus"}, "55925608200": {"Name": "Nann T.", "AuthorID": "55925608200", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Newcastle"}}}
