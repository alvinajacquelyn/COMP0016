Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.Purpose:To report a simultaneous occurrence of 2 rare corneal dystrophies.Methods:A 30-year-old man with a family history of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy type 3 (PPCD3) was invited for ophthalmic examination. Sanger sequencing of the coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of disease-associated genes, ZEB1 and UBIAD1, was performed.Results:The clinical findings suggested co-occurrence of PPCD3 and Schnyder corneal dystrophy in the proband. This dual diagnosis was supported by genetic findings. He was identified to carry a previously reported heterozygous nonsense mutation in ZEB1: c.2157C>G; p.(Tyr719), and a novel heterozygous missense mutation in UBIAD1: c.569T>C; p.(Ile190Thr). The mother of the proband only carried c.2157C>G in ZEB1, and slit-lamp examination of her corneas showed endothelial lesions characteristic of PPCD3. The sister of the proband carried c.569T>C in UBIAD1 and had corneal crystal deposition in her anterior stroma consistent with the diagnosis of Schnyder corneal dystrophy.Conclusions:This case illustrates the coincidental occurrence of 2 rare and genetically distinct corneal dystrophies in a single patient. Furthermore, it highlights the need to perform comprehensive phenotyping in combination with appropriate genetic diagnostic testing to achieve an accurate diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coincidental findings", "posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy", "Schnyder corneal dystrophy", "UBIAD1", "ZEB1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary", "Dimethylallyltranstransferase", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation", "Zinc Finger E-box-Binding Homeobox 1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066160316", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"51763434300": {"Name": "Dudakova L.", "AuthorID": "51763434300", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University"}, "6507413509": {"Name": "Skalicka P.", "AuthorID": "6507413509", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University"}, "14119954300": {"Name": "Liskova P.", "AuthorID": "14119954300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, General University Hospital in Prague"}, "35315591900": {"Name": "Davidson A.E.", "AuthorID": "35315591900", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
