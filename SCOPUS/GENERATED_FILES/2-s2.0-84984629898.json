By integrating and analysing a wealth of evidence from unpublished reports, a much more detailed picture of early arable agriculture has emerged. The improved chronological resolution reveals changing patterns in the exploitation of different plant species during the course of the Neolithic that belie simplistic notions of a steady intensification in farming, juxtaposed with a concomitant decline in foraging. It is possible that here, as in other areas of Europe, cereal cultivation became less important in the later Neolithic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["archaeobotany", "farming", "foraging", "Ireland", "Neolithic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984629898", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"26034228000": {"Name": "McClatchie M.", "AuthorID": "26034228000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Archaeology and Palaeoecology, Queen's University Belfast"}, "7003621102": {"Name": "Whitehouse N.J.", "AuthorID": "7003621102", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Plymouth University"}, "56812450800": {"Name": "Barratt P.", "AuthorID": "56812450800", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Plymouth University"}, "55489151800": {"Name": "McLaughlin T.R.", "AuthorID": "55489151800", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Archaeology and Palaeoecology, Queen's University Belfast"}, "6602614388": {"Name": "Bogaard A.", "AuthorID": "6602614388", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology, University of Oxford"}, "6603283174": {"Name": "Schulting R.J.", "AuthorID": "6603283174", "AffiliationID": "60175816", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology, University of Oxford"}, "6506782318": {"Name": "Colledge S.", "AuthorID": "6506782318", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
