A cross-sectional study was conducted in random population samples of 6340 men and 5792 women (age 45-69 years) from the Czech Republic, Russia and Poland. Dietary data were collected using FFQ. The healthy diet indicator (HDI) was constructed using eight nutrient/food intakes (HDI components) to reflect the adherence to WHO dietary guideline. The extent of imbalance between effort and reward was measured by the effort:reward (ER) ratio; the effort score was the numerator and the reward score was multiplied by a factor adjusting for unequal number of items in the denominator. Logistic regression and linear regression were used to assess the associations between exposures (ER ratio and OC) and outcomes (HDI components and HDI) after adjustment for confounders and mediators. The results showed that high ER ratio and high OC were significantly associated with unhealthy diet quality. For a 1-sd increase in the ER ratio, HDI was reduced by 0\u00b7030 and 0\u00b7033 sd in men and women, and for a 1-sd increase in OC, HDI was decreased by 0\u00b7036 and 0\u00b7032 sd in men and women, respectively. The modifying role of OC in ERI-diet relationships was non-significant. To improve diet quality at workplace, a multiple-level approach combining organisational intervention for work stress and individual intervention for vulnerable personality is recommended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diet", "Effort-reward imbalance", "Over-commitment", "Personality", "Work stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Czech Republic", "Diet", "Diet Records", "Europe, Eastern", "Female", "Food Habits", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nutrition Policy", "Nutritive Value", "Personality", "Poland", "Reward", "Russia", "Stress, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Work", "World Health Organization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960814214", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"56311120600": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "56311120600", "AffiliationID": "60073385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Hsinchu Branch"}, "8681509900": {"Name": "Peasey A.", "AuthorID": "8681509900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "20434382400": {"Name": "Stefler D.", "AuthorID": "20434382400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57112936100": {"Name": "Chan J.", "AuthorID": "57112936100", "AffiliationID": "60073385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Hsinchu Branch"}, "6603876724": {"Name": "Malyutina S.", "AuthorID": "6603876724", "AffiliationID": "60070539, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences"}, "7004784461": {"Name": "Pajak A.", "AuthorID": "7004784461", "AffiliationID": "60021323, 60021361", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Sciences, Jagiellonian University, Medical College"}, "6701399454": {"Name": "Kubinova R.", "AuthorID": "6701399454", "AffiliationID": "60012911", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Health Monitoring System, National Institute of Public Health"}}}
