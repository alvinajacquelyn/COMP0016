We examined whether participants\u2019 motivation to think deeply (\u2018need for cognition,\u2019 NC) and belief in science moderated their trust in potentially fallible detection dog evidence when selecting a verdict in a trial scenario. A detection dog twice indicated the presence of drugs in the scenario, yet no drugs were actually found. Those who chose a guilty verdict without drugs present featured stronger beliefs in detection dog evidence. They were also more confident that a dog alert indicated the presence of drugs, even though the scientific literature actually shows that detection dog evidence is subject to biases and other challenges to reliability. Our findings indicate that an unsubstantiated belief and trust in detection dog evidence may negatively influence juror decision-making, which may, in turn, pose consequences for fairness and justice. Participants believed that detection dogs provide powerful and reliable evidence, and these beliefs were clearly associated with stronger beliefs in science. These findings, therefore, raise serious concerns about jurors\u2019 indiscriminate trust in forensic evidence, be it detection dog evidence or other lines of evidence presented in court.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bias", "detection dog", "forensic evidence", "jury decision making", "Mythic infallibility", "sniff evidence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060685290", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"13609898800": {"Name": "Lit L.", "AuthorID": "13609898800", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Science, University of California"}, "7004067250": {"Name": "Oberbauer A.", "AuthorID": "7004067250", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Animal Science, University of California"}, "36158972300": {"Name": "Sutton J.E.", "AuthorID": "36158972300", "AffiliationID": "60026497", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, Hobart and William Smith Colleges"}, "7004020479": {"Name": "Dror I.E.", "AuthorID": "7004020479", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
