This review examines the literature that has looked for behavioral and cognitive correlates of the newly recognized genetic epilepsies in adults. While some studies report clear cognitive phenotypes associated with specific genetic mutations in adults with epilepsy, others report remarkable clinical heterogeneity. In the second part of this review, we discuss some of the factors that may influence the findings in this literature. Cognitive function is the product of both genetic and environmental influences. Neuropsychological phenotypes under direct genetic influence may be wider and more subtle than specific deficits within discreet cognitive domains and may be reflected in broader, multidimensional measures of cognitive function than those tapped by scores on standardized tests of function. Future studies must be carefully designed to reflect these factors. It is also imperative that studies with negative findings are assigned as much value as those with positive results and published accordingly.
