Objective: This paper examined the extent to which 279 items reported in an I-PROM (PSYCHLOPS) added qualitative information which was not captured by two well-established outcome measures (CORE-OM and PHQ-9). Design: Comparison of items was only conducted for patients scoring above the \u201ccaseness\u201d threshold on the standardized measures. Setting and patients: 107 patients were participating in therapy within addiction and general psychiatric clinical settings. Main results: Almost every patient (95%) reported at least one item whose content was not covered by PHQ-9, and 71% reported at least one item not covered by CORE-OM. Discussion: Results demonstrate the relevance of individualized outcome assessment for capturing data describing the issues of greatest concern to patients, as nomothetic measures do not always seem to capture the whole story.", "AuthorKeywords": ["individualised PROMS", "outcome assessment", "patient-centred outome", "patient-generated measures", "thematic analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery of Health Care", "Humans", "Mental Disorders", "Patient Care", "Patient Health Questionnaire", "Patient Reported Outcome Measures", "Substance-Related Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034760562", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"35339793400": {"Name": "Sales C.", "AuthorID": "35339793400", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Education Science at the University of Porto (FPCEUP), Center for Psychology at the University of Porto (CPUP), University of Porto"}, "57202336530": {"Name": "Neves I.", "AuthorID": "57202336530", "AffiliationID": "60021696, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, University of Lisbon"}, "55226085300": {"Name": "Alves P.", "AuthorID": "55226085300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7005599508": {"Name": "Ashworth M.", "AuthorID": "7005599508", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}}}
