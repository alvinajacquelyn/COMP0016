The system employs an embedded Linux board as the main on-board control module to extract and preprocess raw measurements from various navigational sensors using the real time operating system (RTOS). An unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based data fusion algorithm has been developed to fuse the obtained and preprocessed sensor measurements and provide more reliable and accurate estimations of USV\u2019s navigational data in real time. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the data fusion algorithm in reducing unpredicted errors of a standalone sensor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multi-sensor data fusion", "Real time operating system", "Unmanned surface vehicle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accurate estimation", "Data fusion algorithm", "Design and implementations", "Multi-sensor data-fusion systems", "Multisensor data fusion", "Navigational sensors", "Real time operating system", "Unscented Kalman Filter"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060299281", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"56612461100": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "56612461100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering University College London"}, "56515441900": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "56515441900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering University College London"}, "56612779200": {"Name": "Song R.", "AuthorID": "56612779200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering University College London"}, "7005111389": {"Name": "Bucknall R.", "AuthorID": "7005111389", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering University College London"}}}
