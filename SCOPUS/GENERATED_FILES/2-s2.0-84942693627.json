Despite recent evidence supporting its importance for behavioral, neuroendocrine and transcriptional effects of glucocorticoids, there has been a paucity of information regarding the origin of glucocorticoid pulsatility. In this review we discuss the mechanisms regulating pulsatile dynamics of the HPA axis, and how these dynamics become disrupted in disease. Our recent mathematical, experimental and clinical studies show that glucocorticoid pulsatility can be generated and maintained by dynamic processes at the level of the pituitary-adrenal axis, and that an intra-adrenal negative feedback may contribute to these dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adrenal cortex", "Glucocorticoids", "HPA axis", "Ultradian rhythms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Feedback, Physiological", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System", "Neuroendocrinology", "Pituitary-Adrenal System", "Stress, Physiological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942693627", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"22433919800": {"Name": "Spiga F.", "AuthorID": "22433919800", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology, University of Bristol"}, "55023363200": {"Name": "Walker J.J.", "AuthorID": "55023363200", "AffiliationID": "60026479, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Biomedical Modelling and Analysis, University of Exeter"}, "36067479700": {"Name": "Lightman S.L.", "AuthorID": "36067479700", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Henry Wellcome Laboratories for Integrative Neuroscience and Endocrinology, University of Bristol"}, "56877982500": {"Name": "Gupta R.", "AuthorID": "56877982500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "57203214780": {"Name": "Terry J.R.", "AuthorID": "57203214780", "AffiliationID": "60026479, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Biomedical Modelling and Analysis, University of Exeter"}}}
