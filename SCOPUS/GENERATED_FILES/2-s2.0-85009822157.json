All rights reserved.Purpose: To establish whether maintenance lapatinib after first-line chemotherapy is beneficial in human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 1/HER2-positive metastatic urothelial bladder cancer (UBC). Methods: Patients with metastatic UBC were screened centrally for HER1/HER2 overexpression. Patients who screened positive for HER1/2 and who did not have progressive disease during chemotherapy (four to eight cycles) were randomly assigned one to one to lapatinib or placebo after completion of first-line/initial chemotherapy for metastatic disease. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Between 2007 and 2013, 446 patients with UBC were screened, and 232 with HER1-or HER2-positive disease were randomly assigned. The median PFS for lapatinib and placebo was 4.5 (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.4) and 5.1 (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.8) months, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.43; P = .63). The overall survival for lapatinib and placebo was 12.6 (95% CI, 9.0 to 16.2) and 12.0 (95% CI, 10.5 to 14.9) months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.31; P = .80). Discontinuation due to adverse events were similar in both arms (6% lapatinib and 5% placebo). The rate of grade 3 to 4 adverse events for lapatinib and placebo was 8.6% versus 8.1% (P = .82). Preplanned subset analysis of patients strongly positive for HER1/HER2 (3+ on immunohisto-chemistry; n = 111), patients positive for only HER1 (n = 102), and patients positive for only HER2 (n = 42) showed no significant benefit with lapatinib in terms of PFS and overall survival (P > .05 for each). Conclusion: This trial did not find significant improvements in outcome by the addition of maintenance lapatinib to standard of care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Carcinoma, Transitional Cell", "Cisplatin", "Disease-Free Survival", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Maintenance Chemotherapy", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quinazolines", "Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor", "Receptor, ErbB-2", "Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009822157", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"34572458000": {"Name": "Powles T.", "AuthorID": "34572458000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60170516, 60159931, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts Health NHS Trust and the Royal Free NHS Trust, Queen Mary University of London"}, "23012898100": {"Name": "Sarker S.J.", "AuthorID": "23012898100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60170516, 60159931, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts Health NHS Trust and the Royal Free NHS Trust, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57189024135": {"Name": "Ackerman C.", "AuthorID": "57189024135", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60170516, 60159931, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts Health NHS Trust and the Royal Free NHS Trust, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6701628860": {"Name": "Berney D.", "AuthorID": "6701628860", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60170516, 60159931, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Barts Cancer Institute, Barts Health NHS Trust and the Royal Free NHS Trust, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56468627300": {"Name": "Hughes S.", "AuthorID": "56468627300", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St. Thomas' National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "8654568500": {"Name": "Chowdhury S.", "AuthorID": "8654568500", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St. Thomas' National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust"}, "7006638051": {"Name": "Huddart R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006638051", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Research"}, "24080500700": {"Name": "Elliott T.", "AuthorID": "24080500700", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55547120726": {"Name": "Jones R.", "AuthorID": "55547120726", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow"}, "7403344985": {"Name": "Hussain S.", "AuthorID": "7403344985", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "11739253300": {"Name": "Crabb S.", "AuthorID": "11739253300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "6506722553": {"Name": "Jagdev S.", "AuthorID": "6506722553", "AffiliationID": "60020454", "AffiliationName": "St. James's University Hospital"}, "7005982175": {"Name": "Chester J.", "AuthorID": "7005982175", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University"}, "7801630835": {"Name": "Hilman S.", "AuthorID": "7801630835", "AffiliationID": "60024764", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Haematology and Oncology Centre"}, "14022373700": {"Name": "Beresford M.", "AuthorID": "14022373700", "AffiliationID": "60027647", "AffiliationName": "Royal United Hospitals Bath"}, "8545999400": {"Name": "Macdonald G.", "AuthorID": "8545999400", "AffiliationID": "60024626", "AffiliationName": "Aberdeen Royal Infirmary"}, "57192985644": {"Name": "Santhanam S.", "AuthorID": "57192985644", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "24074045200": {"Name": "Frew J.A.", "AuthorID": "24074045200", "AffiliationID": "105311057", "AffiliationName": "Northern Centre for Cancer Care"}, "57213657574": {"Name": "Stockdale A.", "AuthorID": "57213657574", "AffiliationID": "60159688", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital"}}}
