These parameters are the amplitudes, frequencies, initial phase angles, damping factors and the offset. The proposed strategy entails the design of a new kind of kernel function that, compared to existing ones, allows for the identification of the initial conditions of the signal-generator system. The worst-case behavior of the proposed algorithm in the presence of bounded additive disturbances is fully characterized by Input-to-State Stability arguments. Numerical examples including the comparisons with some existing tools are reported to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Additive disturbance", "Finite time estimations", "Identification scheme", "Input-to-state stability", "Kernel based approach", "Multi-sinusoidal signals", "Sinusoidal signals", "Worst-case behaviors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065243024", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56021899900": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "56021899900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57191613606": {"Name": "Li P.", "AuthorID": "57191613606", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "KIOS Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence, University of Cyprus"}, "23991087000": {"Name": "Pin G.", "AuthorID": "23991087000", "AffiliationID": "60019612", "AffiliationName": "Electrolux Italia S.p.A"}, "8896056300": {"Name": "Fedele G.", "AuthorID": "8896056300", "AffiliationID": "60020261", "AffiliationName": "DIMES, University of Calabria, Rende (CS)"}}}
