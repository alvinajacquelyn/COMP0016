However, it is still unknown if such a distribution function can be approximated analytically and accurately. In this paper, we consider a system model with a Nakagami-m fading channel and an exponential arrival process, and derive a simple approximation formula for the CCDF of delay. Simulation results show that our formula is accurate in approximating the CCDF of delay in the system model considered above.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arrival process", "Complementary cumulative distribution functions", "Effective capacity", "Nakagami-m channels", "Nakagami-m fading channels", "System modeling", "Wireless communication system"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964888620", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"]], "AuthorData": {"9734845000": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "9734845000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003497031": {"Name": "Darwazeh I.", "AuthorID": "7003497031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
