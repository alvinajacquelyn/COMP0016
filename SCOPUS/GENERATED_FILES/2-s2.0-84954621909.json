All rights are reserved.Retinal cell apoptosis occurs in many eye conditions, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and Alzheimer's disease. Real-time detection of retinal cell apoptosis has potential clinical value in early disease detection, as well as evaluating disease progression and treatment efficacy. Here, we describe our novel imaging technology DARC (Detection of Apoptosing Retinal Cells), which can be used to visualize single retinal neurons undergoing apoptosis in real time, by using fluorescently labeled Annexin A5 and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO). Clinical trials of DARC in glaucoma patients are due to start shortly, but in this chapter, we describe this technique in experimental animal models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Detection of apoptosing retinal cells", "Glaucoma", "Retinal neurodegeneration", "Scanning laser ophthalmoscope"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Molecular Biology", "Ophthalmoscopy", "Retina", "Retinal Ganglion Cells"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954621909", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"16646771400": {"Name": "Normando E.M.", "AuthorID": "16646771400", "AffiliationID": "60016550, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Healthcare Trust, The Western Eye Hospital"}, "56636891100": {"Name": "Dehabadi M.H.", "AuthorID": "56636891100", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Degeneration Research Group, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "42561262400": {"Name": "Guo L.", "AuthorID": "42561262400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Degeneration Research Group, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55580668100": {"Name": "Turner L.A.", "AuthorID": "55580668100", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Degeneration Research Group, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "56500543500": {"Name": "Pollorsi G.", "AuthorID": "56500543500", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma and Retinal Degeneration Research Group, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57210287162": {"Name": "Francesca Cordeiro M.", "AuthorID": "57210287162", "AffiliationID": "60016550, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College, Healthcare Trust, The Western Eye Hospital"}}}
