Markdowns decrease product exclusivity and hence consumers\u2019 willingness to pay (i.e., snob effect) because most consumers purchasing luxury desire uniqueness. Markdowns also encourage strategic (forward-looking) consumers to wait for lower prices (i.e., strategic effect). Yet, luxury retailers frequently adopt markdowns in practice to stimulate the demand for their seasonal products (i.e., sales effect). To study the impact of these three countervailing effects on a luxury retailer\u2019s markdown policy and rationing strategy, this paper develops a game-theoretic model with strategic and exclusivity-seeking consumers who have heterogeneous (high and low) valuations. We character-ize a luxury retailer\u2019s equilibrium markdown and rationing strategies and find that the retailer induces a buying frenzy (i.e., selling deliberately less than the demand) to increase consumers\u2019 willingness to pay when they are sufficiently exclusivity seeking. We show that the retailer\u2019s markdown policy depends on consumers\u2019 desire for exclusivity when the proportion of consumers with high valuation is not too high or too low. Interestingly, we find that, in such cases, consumers\u2019 higher desire for exclusivity does not motivate the retailer to increase exclusivity and to adopt uniform pricing. To the contrary, it motivates the retailer to decrease the exclusivity and to adopt markdowns. By doing so, we identify exclusivity-seeking consumer behavior as another rationale behind markdown pricing. Last, we find that, when selling to exclusivity-seeking consumers, the negative impact of strategic consumer behavior is lower; however, ignoring it can be more costly.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buying frenzy", "Conspicuous consumption", "Luxury products", "Markdown pricing", "Strategic consumers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85091703122", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"6505927649": {"Name": "Arifo\u011flu K.", "AuthorID": "6505927649", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}, "34067539700": {"Name": "Deo S.", "AuthorID": "34067539700", "AffiliationID": "60104532", "AffiliationName": "Indian School of Business"}, "35599854500": {"Name": "Iravani S.M.R.", "AuthorID": "35599854500", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences, Northwestern University"}}}
