RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Primary care records in England (n = 2,360,631) were searched for incident cases of adult-onset diabetes between 1 January 2005 and 31 March 2016. We examined demographics, diabetes classification, glycemic control, and insulin use in those with and without pancreatic disease (subcategorized into acute pancreatitis or chronic pancreatic disease) before diabetes diagnosis. Regression analysis was used to control for baseline potential risk factors for poor glycemic control (HbA1c \u22657% [53 mmol/mol]) and insulin requirement. RESULTS We identified 31,789 new diagnoses of adult-onset diabetes. Diabetes following pancreatic disease (2.59 [95%CI 2.38-2.81] per 100,000 person-years) wasmore common than type 1 diabetes (1.64 [1.47-1.82]; P < 0.001). The 559 cases of diabetes following pancreatic diseaseweremostly classified by clinicians as type 2 diabetes (87.8%) and uncommonly as diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (2.7%). Diabetes following pancreatic disease was diagnosed at a median age of 59 years and BMI of 29.2 kg/m2. Diabetes following pancreatic disease was associated with poor glycemic control (adjusted odds ratio, 1.7 [1.3-2.2]; P < 0.001) compared with type 2 diabetes. Insulin use within 5 years was 4.1% (3.8-4.4) with type 2 diabetes, 20.9% (14.6-28.9) with diabetes following acute pancreatitis, and 45.8% (34.2-57.9) with diabetes following chronic pancreatic disease. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes of the exocrine pancreas is frequently labeled type 2 diabetes but hasworse glycemic control and a markedly greater requirement for insulin.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Blood Glucose", "Body Mass Index", "Chronic Disease", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "England", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glycated Hemoglobin A", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Incidence", "Insulin", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pancreas, Exocrine", "Pancreatitis", "Primary Health Care", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032454202", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"]], "AuthorData": {"57196437884": {"Name": "Woodmansey C.", "AuthorID": "57196437884", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Surrey"}, "55574138400": {"Name": "McGovern A.P.", "AuthorID": "55574138400", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Surrey"}, "57196440339": {"Name": "McCullough K.A.", "AuthorID": "57196440339", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Research (CEDAR), Royal Surrey County Hospital"}, "12243448100": {"Name": "Whyte M.B.", "AuthorID": "12243448100", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Research (CEDAR), Royal Surrey County Hospital"}, "7102717211": {"Name": "Munro N.M.", "AuthorID": "7102717211", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Surrey"}, "56828828100": {"Name": "Correa A.C.", "AuthorID": "56828828100", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Surrey"}, "57220378138": {"Name": "Gatenby P.A.C.", "AuthorID": "57220378138", "AffiliationID": "60028760", "AffiliationName": "Regional Oesophagogastric Unit/Gastrointestinal Surgery, Royal Surrey County Hospital"}, "55732366200": {"Name": "Jones S.A.", "AuthorID": "55732366200", "AffiliationID": "60032105, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Division of Healthcare Delivery Science, Center for Healthcare Innovation and Delivery Science (CHIDS), Department of Population Health, New York University, Langone Medical Centre"}, "7003334937": {"Name": "De Lusignan S.", "AuthorID": "7003334937", "AffiliationID": "60113753", "AffiliationName": "Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre"}}}
