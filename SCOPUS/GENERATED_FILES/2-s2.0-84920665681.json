Alemtuzumab is increasingly used to reduce the risk of severe GVHD, but there are concerns that T-cell depletion may compromise outcome particularly in older patients. We therefore studied the impact of pre-transplant factors on the outcome of 187 patients with a haematological malignancy over the age of 60 transplanted using an alemtuzumab-based RIC regimen of whom co-morbidity scoring was possible in 169. Of the patients, 120 had a haematopoietic cell transplantation co-morbidity index (HCT-CI) of 0 or 1 and 49 had a score of 2 or more. The 5-year OS was 33%. In multivariable analysis, OS was determined by co-morbidity score (P=0.001) and disease status at transplant (P=0.004) but not by patient age. Non-relapse mortality was determined by co-morbidity score (P=0.001). Two-year OS for patients with a HCT-CI of 0-1 was 59 versus 6% for patients with a higher score. Alemtuzumab-based RIC allografts can be delivered safely in patients aged over 60 but co-morbidity scoring is mandatory to identify patients who will benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Allografts", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Female", "Great Britain", "Hematologic Neoplasms", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Depletion", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Societies, Medical", "Survival Rate", "Transplantation Conditioning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920665681", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"24081056700": {"Name": "Nikolousis E.", "AuthorID": "24081056700", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Heart of England NHS Trust"}, "36090075800": {"Name": "Nagra S.", "AuthorID": "36090075800", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Haaematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "7403191653": {"Name": "Cook M.", "AuthorID": "7403191653", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Haaematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "7005603726": {"Name": "Craddock C.", "AuthorID": "7005603726", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Haaematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "57169716400": {"Name": "Pearce R.", "AuthorID": "57169716400", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "BSBMT Registry, Guy's Hospital"}, "56489482900": {"Name": "Perry J.", "AuthorID": "56489482900", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "BSBMT Registry, Guy's Hospital"}, "35169797900": {"Name": "Kirkland K.", "AuthorID": "35169797900", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "BSBMT Registry, Guy's Hospital"}, "35427082900": {"Name": "Byrne J.", "AuthorID": "35427082900", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "7201812899": {"Name": "Russell N.", "AuthorID": "7201812899", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals"}, "11940742400": {"Name": "Dignan F.", "AuthorID": "11940742400", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202493348": {"Name": "Shaw B.E.", "AuthorID": "7202493348", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506610046": {"Name": "Tholouli E.", "AuthorID": "6506610046", "AffiliationID": "60030886", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Infirmary"}, "6603562039": {"Name": "Gilleece M.", "AuthorID": "6603562039", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals"}, "57211066538": {"Name": "Cook G.", "AuthorID": "57211066538", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospitals"}, "57194699035": {"Name": "Littlewood T.", "AuthorID": "57194699035", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55880762100": {"Name": "Peniket A.", "AuthorID": "55880762100", "AffiliationID": "60170323", "AffiliationName": "Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
