Commonly, each furnace is equipped with a tailored model predictive control system to ensure consistent heated product quality such as final discharge temperature and temperature uniformity within the stock pieces. Those furnace models normally perform well for a designed operating condition but cannot usually cope with a variety of transient furnace operations such as non-uniform batch scheduling and production delay from downstream processes. Under these conditions, manual interventions that rely on past experience are often used to assist the process until the next stable furnace operation has been attained. Therefore, more advanced furnace control systems are useful to meet the challenge of adapting to those circumstances whilst also being able to predict the dynamic thermal behaviour of the furnace. In view of the above, this paper describes in detail an episode of actual transient furnace operation, and demonstrates a nonlinear dynamic simulation of this furnace operation using a zone method based model with a self-adapting predictive control scheme. The proposed furnace model was found to be capable of dynamically responding to the changes that occurred in the furnace operation, achieving about \u00b110 \u00b0C discrepancies with respect to measured discharge temperature, and the self-adapting predictive control scheme is shown to outperform the existing scheme used for furnace control in terms of stability and fuel consumption (fuel saving of about 6%).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hybrid model", "Nonlinear dynamic simulation", "Reheating furnace", "Self-adapting predictive control", "Zone method"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex nonlinear dynamics", "Furnace control systems", "Heat transfer performance", "Hybrid model", "Predictive control", "Reheating furnaces", "Temperature uniformity", "Zone method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042291007", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"56116162600": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "56116162600", "AffiliationID": "60004407, 60116362", "AffiliationName": "Complex Systems Research Centre, School of Management, Cranfield University"}, "15081806200": {"Name": "Varga L.", "AuthorID": "15081806200", "AffiliationID": "60004407, 60116362", "AffiliationName": "Complex Systems Research Centre, School of Management, Cranfield University"}, "57193305182": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "57193305182", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Science, University of South Wales"}, "7101866572": {"Name": "Roach P.", "AuthorID": "7101866572", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Computing, Engineering and Science, University of South Wales"}, "16424733400": {"Name": "Broughton J.", "AuthorID": "16424733400", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "British Steel R&D Swinden Technology Centre"}}}
