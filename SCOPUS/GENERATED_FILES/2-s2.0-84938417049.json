There are an abundance of techniques for removal of orbital bone, fat, or a combination published in the scientific literature. The relative efficacy and complications of these interventions in relation to the specific indications remain as yet undocumented. We performed a systematic review of the current published evidence for the effectiveness of orbital decompression, possible complications, and impact on quality of life. Methods: We searched the current databases for medical literature and controlled trials, oculoplastic textbooks, and conference proceedings to identify relevant data up to February 2015. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing two or more interventions for orbital decompression. Results: We identified only two eligible RCTs for inclusion in the review. As a result of the significant variability between studies on decompression, i.e., methodology and outcome measures, we did not perform a meta-analysis. One study suggests that the transantral approach and endonasal technique had similar effects in reducing exophthalmos but the latter is safer. The second study provides evidence that intravenous steroids may be superior to primary surgical decompression in the management of compressive optic neuropathy requiring less secondary surgical procedures. Conclusion: Most of the published literature on orbital decompression consists of retrospective, uncontrolled trials. There is evidence from those studies that removal of the medial and lateral wall (balanced) and the deep lateral wall decompression, with or without fat removal, may be the most effective surgical methods with only few complications. There is a clear unmet need for controlled trials evaluating the different techniques for orbital decompression. Ideally, future studies should address the effectiveness, possible complications, quality of life, and cost of each intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decompression", "DON", "Exophthalmos", "GO", "Graves\u2019", "Orbit", "Orbitopathy", "Strabismus", "TED", "Thyroid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decompression, Surgical", "Graves Ophthalmopathy", "Humans", "Orbit", "Quality of Life", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938417049", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55872796000": {"Name": "Boboridis K.G.", "AuthorID": "55872796000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55760502200": {"Name": "Voudouragkaki I.C.", "AuthorID": "55760502200", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "1st University Department of Ophthalmology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "7003364962": {"Name": "Konstas A.G.P.", "AuthorID": "7003364962", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "3rd University Department of Ophthalmology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "12752985200": {"Name": "Mikropoulos D.G.", "AuthorID": "12752985200", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "3rd University Department of Ophthalmology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6701515549": {"Name": "Uddin J.", "AuthorID": "6701515549", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6603038753": {"Name": "Mangouritsas G.", "AuthorID": "6603038753", "AffiliationID": "60069142", "AffiliationName": "Eye Clinic, General Hospital \u201cRed Cross\u201d"}}}
