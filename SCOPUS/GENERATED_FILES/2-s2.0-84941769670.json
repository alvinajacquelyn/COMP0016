Methods: The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) cohort of the Whole Systems Demonstrator Trial is a pragmatic General Practitioner (GP) clustered randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating TH in the UK from three regions in England. All patients at a participating GP practice were deemed eligible for inclusion in the study if they were diagnosed with COPD. Results: 447 participants completed baseline and either a short (4 months) or long term (12 months) follow-up. There was a trend of improved QoL and mood in the TH group at longer-term follow-up, but not short term follow-up. Emotional functioning (g = 0.280 95%CI, 0.051\u20130.510) and mastery reached (g = 2.979 95%CI, 0\u20130.46) significance at P < 0.05 (all Hedges g <0.3). Conclusions: TH showed minimal benefit to QoL in COPD patients who were not preselected to be at increased risk of acute exacerbations. Benefits were more likely in disease specific measures at longer term follow-up. TH is a complex intervention and should be embedded in a service that is evidenced based. Outcome measures must be sensitive enough to detect changes in the target population for the specific intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["COPD", "patient reported outcomes", "quality of life", "self-management", "self-monitoring", "telehealth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Anxiety", "Delivery of Health Care", "Disease Management", "Female", "General Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Quality of Life", "Self-Management", "Telemedicine", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941769670", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"8705642500": {"Name": "Rixon L.", "AuthorID": "8705642500", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research, School of Health Sciences, City University"}, "8690683800": {"Name": "Hirani S.P.", "AuthorID": "8690683800", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research, School of Health Sciences, City University"}, "50261366700": {"Name": "Cartwright M.", "AuthorID": "50261366700", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research, School of Health Sciences, City University"}, "55614872500": {"Name": "Beynon M.", "AuthorID": "55614872500", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research, School of Health Sciences, City University"}, "55808072084": {"Name": "Newman S.P.", "AuthorID": "55808072084", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Health Services Research, School of Health Sciences, City University"}, "7005767637": {"Name": "Doll H.", "AuthorID": "7005767637", "AffiliationID": "110987164", "AffiliationName": "ICON Patient Reported Outcomes"}, "37016789300": {"Name": "Steventon A.", "AuthorID": "37016789300", "AffiliationID": "100406671", "AffiliationName": "Data Analytics, The Health Foundation"}, "16022078600": {"Name": "Henderson C.", "AuthorID": "16022078600", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science"}}}
