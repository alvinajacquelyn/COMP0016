We present a new integral representation of the leading order solution in the \"Fock region\", i.e. the neighbourhood of a point of tangency between the incident rays and the scatterer boundary, from which the penumbra (light-shadow boundary) effects originate. The new representation, which is equivalent to the classical Fourier integral representation and its well-studied \"forked contour\" regularisation, reveals that the Pekeris caret function (sometimes referred to as a \"Fock-type integral\" or a \"Fock scattering function\"), a special function already known to describe the field in the penumbra, is also an intrinsic part of the solution in the inner Fock region. We also provide the correct interpretation of a divergent integral arising in the analysis of Tew et al. (2000), enabling the results of that paper to be used for quantitative calculations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Grazing incidence", "Matched asymptotic analysis", "Parabolic wave equation", "Penumbra field", "Tangent rays", "Wave diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Grazing incidence", "Parabolic wave equation", "Penumbra field", "Tangent rays", "Wave diffractions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948098582", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"36637487000": {"Name": "Hewett D.P.", "AuthorID": "36637487000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Observatory Quarter"}}}
