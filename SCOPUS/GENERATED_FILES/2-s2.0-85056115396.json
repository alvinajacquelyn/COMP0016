The aim of this work is to present and validate a novel model based reconstruction method that can correct for these distortions. Methods: In regions of severe signal pileup, standard techniques for distortion correction have difficulty recovering the underlying true signal. Furthermore, because of drifts and inaccuracies in the determination of center frequency, echo planar imaging (EPI) scans can be shifted in the phase-encoding direction. In this work, using a B0 field map and a set of EPI data acquired with blip-up and blip-down phase encoding gradients, we model the distortion correction problem linking the distortion-free image to the acquired raw corrupted k-space data and solve it in a manner analogous to the sensitivity encoding method. Both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the proposed method is performed in vivo in 10 patients. Results: Without distortion correction, mean Dice similarity scores between a reference T2W and the uncorrected EPI images were 0.64 and 0.60 for b-values of 0 and 500 s/mm2, respectively. Compared to the Topup (distortion correction method commonly used for neuro imaging), the proposed method achieved Dice scores (0.87 and 0.85 versus 0.82 and 0.80) and better qualitative results in patients where signal pileup was present because of high rectal gas residue. Conclusion: Model-based reconstruction can be used for distortion correction in prostate diffusion MRI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diffusion", "geometric distortion", "prostate MRI", "signal pile-up"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion-weighted MRI", "Distortion correction", "Echo planar imaging", "Geometric distortion", "Model based reconstruction", "Quantitative and qualitative assessments", "Sensitivity encoding", "Signal pile-up", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Artifacts", "Diffusion", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Echo-Planar Imaging", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Theoretical", "Prostate", "Prostatic Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056115396", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57203046078": {"Name": "Usman M.", "AuthorID": "57203046078", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57194345396": {"Name": "Kakkar L.", "AuthorID": "57194345396", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College Hospital"}, "57210526592": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "57210526592", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College Hospital"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College Hospital"}}}
