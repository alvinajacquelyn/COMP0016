FBA has been successfully used to gain insight in a wide range of applications, such as range of substrate utilization, product yields and to design metabolic engineering strategies to improve bioprocess performance. A well-known challenge associated with large genome-scale metabolic networks is that they result in underdetermined problem formulations. Consequently, rather than unique solutions, FBA and related methods examine ranges of reaction flux values that are consistent with the studied physiological conditions. The wider the reported flux ranges, the higher the uncertainty in the determination of basic reaction properties, limiting interpretability of and confidence in the results. Herein, we propose a new, computationally efficient approach that refines flux range predictions by constraining reaction fluxes on the basis of the elemental balance of carbon. We compared carbon constraint FBA (ccFBA) against experimentally-measured intracellular fluxes using the latest CHO GEM (iCHO1766) and were able to substantially improve the accuracy of predicted flux values compared with FBA. ccFBA can be used as a stand-alone method but is also compatible with and complimentary to other constraint-based approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon constraining", "CHO", "constraint-based modeling", "FBA", "genome-scale metabolic network"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cellular metabolism", "Computationally efficient", "Constraint-based modeling", "Flux balance analysis", "Genome-scale metabolic network", "Intracellular reactions", "Physiological condition", "Substrate utilization", "Animals", "Carbon", "CHO Cells", "Cricetulus", "Metabolic Flux Analysis", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070850968", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"56422425700": {"Name": "Lularevic M.", "AuthorID": "56422425700", "AffiliationID": "100468354", "AffiliationName": "Research and Technology, Lonza Biologics PLC"}, "25029723500": {"Name": "Kiparissides A.", "AuthorID": "25029723500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602910043": {"Name": "Racher A.J.", "AuthorID": "6602910043", "AffiliationID": "100468354", "AffiliationName": "Research and Technology, Lonza Biologics PLC"}, "57193769156": {"Name": "Jaques C.", "AuthorID": "57193769156", "AffiliationID": "100468354", "AffiliationName": "Research and Technology, Lonza Biologics PLC"}}}
