Karger GmbH, Freiburg.Objectives: This study investigates whether health and appearance consequences predict intentions to prevent weight gain and whether these relationships differ in younger versus older adults and in men versus women. Methods: UK adults aged 18-26 years (younger adults; n = 584) or >45 years (older adults; n = 107) participated in an online survey. Logistic regression assessed associations between intentions to avoid gaining weight and age, gender as well as perceived negative consequences of weight gain for health and appearance. Co-variates were ethnicity, education, weight perception and perceived weight gain vulnerability. Interactions between age, gender and perceived health and appearance consequences of weight gain were also tested. Results: Perceived negative appearance consequences of weight gain predicted weight gain prevention intentions (OR = 9.3, p < 0.001). Health concerns were not a significant predictor of intentions overall but were a strong predictor for older adults (age \u00d7 health concern interaction: OR = 13.6, p > 0.01). Conclusion: Concerns about feeling unattractive predict intentions to prevent weight gain. However, health consequences of weight gain are only important motivators for older adults. Future research should identify ways to shift the focus of young people from appearance concerns towards the health benefits of maintaining a healthy weight.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Health", "Intention", "Physical appearance", "Weight gain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Attitude to Health", "Body Weight", "Body Weight Maintenance", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Exercise", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Intention", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Prospective Studies", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Weight Gain", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044365411", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"36196242700": {"Name": "Beeken R.J.", "AuthorID": "36196242700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57201340569": {"Name": "Mahdi S.", "AuthorID": "57201340569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7401522015": {"Name": "Johnson F.", "AuthorID": "7401522015", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "51565577500": {"Name": "Meisel S.F.", "AuthorID": "51565577500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
