Variability in measured A\u03b242 concentrations at different laboratories may be overcome by standardization and establishing traceability to a reference system. Candidate certified reference materials (CRMs) are validated herein for this purpose. Methods: Commutability of 16 candidate CRM formats was assessed across five CSF A\u03b242 immunoassays and one mass spectrometry (MS) method in a set of 48 individual clinical CSF samples. Promising candidate CRM formats (neat CSF and CSF spiked with A\u03b242) were identified and subjected to validation across eight (Elecsys, EUROIMMUN, IBL, INNO-BIA AlzBio3, INNOTEST, MSD, Simoa, and Saladax) immunoassays and the MS method in 32 individual CSF samples. Commutability was evaluated by Passing-Bablok regression and the candidate CRM termed commutable when found within the prediction interval (PI). The relative distance to the regression line was assessed. Results: The neat CSF candidate CRM format was commutable for almost all method comparisons, except for the Simoa/MSD, Simoa/MS and MS/IBL where it was found just outside the 95% PI. However, the neat CSF was found within 5% relative distance to the regression line for MS/IBL, between 5% and 10% for Simoa/MS and between 10% and 15% for Simoa/MSD comparisons. Conclusions: The neat CSF candidate CRM format was commutable for 33 of 36 method comparisons, only one comparison more than expected given the 95% PI acceptance limit. We conclude that the neat CSF candidate CRM can be used for value assignment of the kit calibrators for the different A\u03b242 methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid", "biomarker", "cerebrospinal fluid", "commutability", "reference material"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Limit of Detection", "Reference Standards", "Tandem Mass Spectrometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974691647", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"16047002600": {"Name": "Bjerke M.", "AuthorID": "16047002600", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "36574061600": {"Name": "Pannee J.", "AuthorID": "36574061600", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "35083743300": {"Name": "Kuhlmann J.", "AuthorID": "35083743300", "AffiliationID": "60103695, 60029640", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM)"}, "6603576442": {"Name": "Zegers I.", "AuthorID": "6603576442", "AffiliationID": "60103695, 60029640", "AffiliationName": "European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM)"}, "55156917800": {"Name": "Lewczuk P.", "AuthorID": "55156917800", "AffiliationID": "60026724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegeneration Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok"}, "36964443400": {"Name": "Umek R.M.", "AuthorID": "36964443400", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Meso Scale Discovery"}, "57189703414": {"Name": "Lewis J.", "AuthorID": "57189703414", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Meso Scale Discovery"}, "7003363397": {"Name": "Vanmechelen E.", "AuthorID": "7003363397", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx NeuroSciences"}, "7003790485": {"Name": "Vanderstichele H.", "AuthorID": "7003790485", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx NeuroSciences"}, "21036335500": {"Name": "Stoops E.", "AuthorID": "21036335500", "AffiliationID": "60112912", "AffiliationName": "ADx NeuroSciences"}, "55537650400": {"Name": "Vandijck M.", "AuthorID": "55537650400", "AffiliationID": "60123757", "AffiliationName": "Fujirebio Europe N.V."}, "6506277502": {"Name": "Kostanjevecki V.", "AuthorID": "6506277502", "AffiliationID": "60123757", "AffiliationName": "Fujirebio Europe N.V."}, "57215443325": {"Name": "Jeromin A.", "AuthorID": "57215443325", "AffiliationID": "60100345", "AffiliationName": "Quanterix, Corp."}, "7004801331": {"Name": "Salamone S.J.", "AuthorID": "7004801331", "AffiliationID": "60116436", "AffiliationName": "Saladax Biomedical, Inc."}, "56647607200": {"Name": "Schmidt O.", "AuthorID": "56647607200", "AffiliationID": "113073105", "AffiliationName": "IBL International GmbH"}, "57189697370": {"Name": "Matzen A.", "AuthorID": "57189697370", "AffiliationID": "113073105", "AffiliationName": "IBL International GmbH"}, "6602385003": {"Name": "Madin K.", "AuthorID": "6602385003", "AffiliationID": "60072289", "AffiliationName": "Roche Diagnostics GmbH"}, "55661859900": {"Name": "Eichenlaub U.", "AuthorID": "55661859900", "AffiliationID": "60072289", "AffiliationName": "Roche Diagnostics GmbH"}, "16644532800": {"Name": "Bittner T.", "AuthorID": "16644532800", "AffiliationID": "60072289", "AffiliationName": "Roche Diagnostics GmbH"}, "57203176542": {"Name": "Shaw L.M.", "AuthorID": "57203176542", "AffiliationID": "60003711, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania"}}}
