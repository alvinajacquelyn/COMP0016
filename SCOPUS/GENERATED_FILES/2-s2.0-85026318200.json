Knowledge exchange is still heavily influenced by researchers' ambitions to publish in highly cited journals and within \"closed partnerships\", where interactions are based upon intellectual property rights. However, perceived inefficiencies, a desire to make publicly funded research available to all and a crisis of confidence in the quality of research published in top journals all serve to fuel demands for more openness in the conduct of science and the exchange of scientific knowledge. Whilst there is a strong logic behind the contention that increased openness will promote efficiencies, quality and fairness, there is still considerable uncertainty about the impact on university-industry collaboration and the balance that needs to be struck between open and closed approaches. Policy obstacles are also likely to impede the pace of change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Knowledge exchange", "Open access", "Open science", "Research funders", "Science policy", "University/industry collaborations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026318200", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (miscellaneous)", "BUSI", "1401"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"], ["Decision Sciences (miscellaneous)", "DECI", "1801"]], "AuthorData": {"35568915100": {"Name": "Chataway J.", "AuthorID": "35568915100", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "University of Sussex"}, "56856557500": {"Name": "Parks S.", "AuthorID": "56856557500", "AffiliationID": "60003873", "AffiliationName": "Westbrook Centre/Milton Rd, RAND Europe"}, "57217626888": {"Name": "Smith E.", "AuthorID": "57217626888", "AffiliationID": "60003873", "AffiliationName": "Westbrook Centre/Milton Rd, RAND Europe"}}}
