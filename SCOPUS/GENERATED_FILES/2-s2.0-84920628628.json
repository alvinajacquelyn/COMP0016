KGaA, Weinheim.This study employed differential proteomic and immunoassay techniques to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms utilized by human muscle (vastus lateralis) in response to high altitude hypoxia exposure. Two groups of subjects, participating in a medical research expedition (A, n = 5, 19d at 5300 m altitude; B, n = 6, 66d up to 8848 m) underwent a \u2248 30% drop of muscular creatine kinase and of glycolytic enzymes abundance. Protein abundance of most enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation was reduced both in A and, particularly, in B. Restriction of \u03b1-ketoglutarate toward succinyl-CoA resulted in increased prolyl hydroxylase 2 and glutamine synthetase. Both A and B were characterized by a reduction of elongation factor 2alpha, controlling protein translation, and by an increase of heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein involved in chaperone-mediated autophagy. Increased protein levels of catalase and biliverdin reductase occurred in A alongside a decrement of voltage-dependent anion channels 1 and 2 and of myosin-binding protein C, suggesting damage to the sarcomeric structures. This study suggests that during acclimatization to hypobaric hypoxia the muscle behaves as a producer of substrates activating a metabolic reprogramming able to support anaplerotically the tricarboxylic acid cycle, to control protein translation, to prevent energy expenditure and to activate chaperone-mediated autophagy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Altitude hypoxia", "Biomedicine", "\u03b1-Ketoglutarate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acclimatization", "Adult", "Altitude", "Female", "Humans", "Ketoglutaric Acids", "Male", "Muscle Proteins", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Proteomics", "Stress, Physiological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920628628", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"16052616700": {"Name": "Levett D.Z.H.", "AuthorID": "16052616700", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthesia and Critical Care Research Unit, University Hospital Southampton, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24594583700": {"Name": "Martin D.S.", "AuthorID": "24594583700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Altitude, Space, and Extreme Environment Medicine, University College London (UCL), Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55348894800": {"Name": "Grocott M.P.W.", "AuthorID": "55348894800", "AffiliationID": "60175924", "AffiliationName": "Southampton NIHR Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit"}, "7007145710": {"Name": "Vigan\u00f2 A.", "AuthorID": "7007145710", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health, University of Milan"}, "6603148410": {"Name": "Capitanio D.", "AuthorID": "6603148410", "AffiliationID": "60070490", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Policlinico San Donato"}, "15042539200": {"Name": "Moriggi M.", "AuthorID": "15042539200", "AffiliationID": "60070490", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Policlinico San Donato"}, "7005211977": {"Name": "Gelfi C.", "AuthorID": "7005211977", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR-Institute of Bioimaging and Molecular Physiology"}, "56536628200": {"Name": "Vasso M.", "AuthorID": "56536628200", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR-Institute of Bioimaging and Molecular Physiology"}, "6505938583": {"Name": "De Palma S.", "AuthorID": "6505938583", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR-Institute of Bioimaging and Molecular Physiology"}, "7006267392": {"Name": "Cerretelli P.", "AuthorID": "7006267392", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "CNR-Institute of Bioimaging and Molecular Physiology"}, "57205685245": {"Name": "Murray A.J.", "AuthorID": "57205685245", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development, and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}}}
