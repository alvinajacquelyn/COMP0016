In particular, this study explores the parameters and signal processing tools that can be used to produce well-contrasted terahertz images of topographic features commonly found in archival documents, such as indentations left by a writing tool, as well as sieve lines. While the amplitude of the waveforms at a specific time delay can provide the most contrasted and legible images of topographic features on flat paper or parchment sheets, this parameter may not be suitable for documents that have a highly irregular surface, such as water- or fire-damaged documents. For analysis of such documents, cross-correlation of the time-domain signals can instead yield images with good contrast. Analysis of the frequency-domain representation of terahertz waveforms can also provide well-contrasted images of topographic features, with improved spatial resolution when utilising high-frequency content. Finally, we point out some of the limitations of these means of analysis for extracting information relating to topographic features of interest from documents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Documents", "Imaging", "Terahertz", "Time domain", "Topography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Archival documents", "Documents", "Extracting information", "Frequency-domain representations", "Tera Hertz", "Time domain", "Time-domain imaging", "Topographic features"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009905323", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55813033300": {"Name": "Bardon T.", "AuthorID": "55813033300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage, The Bartlett, UCL Faculty of the Built Environment"}, "7004705339": {"Name": "Strli\u010d M.", "AuthorID": "7004705339", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage, The Bartlett, UCL Faculty of the Built Environment"}, "35292875100": {"Name": "May R.K.", "AuthorID": "35292875100", "AffiliationID": "60102133", "AffiliationName": "TeraView Ltd"}, "7003739583": {"Name": "Taday P.F.", "AuthorID": "7003739583", "AffiliationID": "60102133", "AffiliationName": "TeraView Ltd"}}}
