The largest experience to date has been in the context of treatment or prevention of cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus. A number of technical hurdles have now been overcome allowing consideration of more widespread application of products compliant with Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, and of the development of commercialization pathways for these products. This review summarizes progress to date and highlights some of the areas that remain problematic and that require further innovation and evaluation before more widespread adoption is considered.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cellular therapy", "cytokine capture", "cytomegalovirus", "MHC multimer", "T cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adoptive Transfer", "Cytomegalovirus", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Humans", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923881247", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"7006124751": {"Name": "Nicholson E.", "AuthorID": "7006124751", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospital"}, "35416735200": {"Name": "Peggs K.S.", "AuthorID": "35416735200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, 72 Huntley Street"}}}
