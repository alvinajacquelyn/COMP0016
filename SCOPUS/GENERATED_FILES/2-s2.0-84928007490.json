All rights reserved.Background: Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of dementia and depression with uncertain longitudinal associations with brain structure. Aims: To examine lifetime blood pressure as a predictor of brain structure in old age. Method: A total of 190 participants (mean age 69.3 years) from the Whitehall II study were screened for hypertension six times (1985-2013). In 2012-2013, participants had a 3T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Data from the MRI were analysed using automated and visual measures of global atrophy, hippocampal atrophy and white matter hyperintensities. Results: Longitudinally, higher mean arterial pressure predicted increased automated white matter hyperintensities (P<0.002). Cross-sectionally, hypertensive participants had increased automated white matter hyperintensities and visually rated deep white matter hyperintensities. There was no significant association with global or hippocampal atrophy. Conclusions: Long-term exposure to high blood pressure predicts hyperintensities, particularly in deep white matter. The greatest changes are seen in those with severe forms of hypertension, suggesting a dose-response pattern.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Distribution", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrophy", "Blood Pressure", "Brain", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dementia", "Depressive Disorder", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Sex Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928007490", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8293151800": {"Name": "Allan C.L.", "AuthorID": "8293151800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology of Ageing Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "23989895900": {"Name": "Zsoldos E.", "AuthorID": "23989895900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology of Ageing Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "26221643100": {"Name": "Filippini N.", "AuthorID": "26221643100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology of Ageing Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "35171535800": {"Name": "Sexton C.E.", "AuthorID": "35171535800", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology of Ageing Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "49862430700": {"Name": "Topiwala A.", "AuthorID": "49862430700", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology of Ageing Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "55510284400": {"Name": "Valkanova V.", "AuthorID": "55510284400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology of Ageing Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7103036598": {"Name": "Mackay C.", "AuthorID": "7103036598", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology of Ageing Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7004932147": {"Name": "Ebmeier K.P.", "AuthorID": "7004932147", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Neurobiology of Ageing Group, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60014856, 60106085", "AffiliationName": "INSERM U1018, H\u00f4pital Paul Brousse"}, "7003480687": {"Name": "Tab\u00e1k A.G.", "AuthorID": "7003480687", "AffiliationID": "60026261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Semmelweis University Faculty of Medicine"}, "7103265845": {"Name": "Shipley M.J.", "AuthorID": "7103265845", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
