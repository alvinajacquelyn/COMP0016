There is increasing interest in conducting trials of novel drugs to treat neonatal seizures, but the unique characteristics of this disorder and patient population require special consideration with regard to trial design. The Critical Path Institute formed a global working group of experts and key stakeholders from academia, the pharmaceutical industry, regulatory agencies, neonatal nurse associations, and patient advocacy groups to develop consensus recommendations for design of clinical trials to treat neonatal seizures. The broad expertise and perspectives of this group were invaluable in developing recommendations addressing: (1) use of neonate-specific adaptive trial designs, (2) inclusion/exclusion criteria, (3) stratification and randomization, (4) statistical analysis, (5) safety monitoring, and (6) definitions of important outcomes. The guidelines are based on available literature and expert consensus, pharmacokinetic analyses, ethical considerations, and parental concerns. These recommendations will ultimately facilitate development of a Master Protocol and design of efficient and successful drug trials to improve the treatment and outcome for this highly vulnerable population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Newborn, Diseases", "Research Design", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061215146", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"6602744026": {"Name": "Soul J.S.", "AuthorID": "6602744026", "AffiliationID": "60030521, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Boston Children\u2019s Hospital & Harvard Medical School"}, "6602252366": {"Name": "Pressler R.", "AuthorID": "6602252366", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7404105558": {"Name": "Allen M.", "AuthorID": "7404105558", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "INFANT Research Centre & Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, University College Cork"}, "7005221485": {"Name": "Rabe H.", "AuthorID": "7005221485", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "7004556369": {"Name": "Portman R.", "AuthorID": "7004556369", "AffiliationID": "60013909", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma Corp"}, "57216557859": {"Name": "Tseng B.", "AuthorID": "57216557859", "AffiliationID": "60013909", "AffiliationName": "Novartis Pharma Corp"}, "35560730300": {"Name": "Hardy P.", "AuthorID": "35560730300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "University of Birmingham"}, "12773400400": {"Name": "Zohar S.", "AuthorID": "12773400400", "AffiliationID": "60000905, 60123796, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, UMRS1138, University Paris V and University Paris VI"}, "35068449000": {"Name": "Romero K.", "AuthorID": "35068449000", "AffiliationID": "100396501", "AffiliationName": "Critical Path Institute"}, "6603963421": {"Name": "Bhatt-Mehta V.", "AuthorID": "6603963421", "AffiliationID": "60008966, 60025778", "AffiliationName": "C.S.Mott Children\u2019s Hospital, University of Michigan"}, "36850067800": {"Name": "Hahn C.", "AuthorID": "36850067800", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology, The Hospital for Sick Children and Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto"}, "7003895723": {"Name": "Denne S.", "AuthorID": "7003895723", "AffiliationID": "60024609, 60008485", "AffiliationName": "Riley Children\u2019s Hospital, Indiana University"}, "57202216933": {"Name": "Auvin S.", "AuthorID": "57202216933", "AffiliationID": "60011675, 60000905, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Neurology Department & INSERM U1141, APHP, Robert Debr\u00e9 University Hospital"}, "7003656582": {"Name": "Vinks A.", "AuthorID": "7003656582", "AffiliationID": "60025152, 60017412, 60030440", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine & Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati"}, "7005736804": {"Name": "Lantos J.", "AuthorID": "7005736804", "AffiliationID": "60019229", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "57216624368": {"Name": "Davis J.M.", "AuthorID": "57216624368", "AffiliationID": "60011387, 60001344, 60023143", "AffiliationName": "The Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center and the Tufts Clinical and Translational Science Institute"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": "122138664", "AffiliationName": "Critical Path Institute (C-Path) International Neonatal Consortium (INC)"}}}
