A basic understanding of how the physicochemical properties of a material's surface affect its ability to form ice has remained elusive. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to directly probe heterogeneous ice nucleation at a hexagonal surface of a nanoparticle of varying hydrophilicity. Surprisingly, we find that structurally identical surfaces can both inhibit and promote ice formation and analogous to a chemical catalyst, it is found that an optimal interaction between the surface and the water exists for promoting ice nucleation. We use our microscopic understanding of the mechanism to design a modified surface in silico with enhanced ice nucleating ability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical catalyst", "Material's surface", "Modified surfaces", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Molecular simulations", "Optimal interactions", "Physicochemical property", "Surface hydrophilicity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929377842", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55225485500": {"Name": "Cox S.J.", "AuthorID": "55225485500", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "54785285800": {"Name": "Slater B.", "AuthorID": "54785285800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre and Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "6506895062": {"Name": "Kathmann S.M.", "AuthorID": "6506895062", "AffiliationID": "60023471", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences Division, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"}}}
