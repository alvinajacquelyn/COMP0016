Block copolymers with highly amphiphilic blocks are promising candidates for fast and robust material assembly into a range of periodic nano-morphologies. The high polarity difference is however an inherent challenge for the simultaneous processing of hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. Here, we show that a solvent exchange through the evaporation of the initial volatiles and redissolution in an azeotrope mixture of polar and apolar solvents with a common high boiling point allows the evolution of a micellar solution towards block copolymer-dictated structures near thermodynamic equilibrium, with controlled access to inorganic cylinders, lamellae and organic cylinders within a continuous inorganic matrix.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amphiphilic block copolymers", "Hydrophilic and hydrophobic", "Inorganic matrices", "Mesoporous metal oxides", "Organic structures", "Solution-processed", "Solvent exchanges", "Thermodynamic equilibria"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930002715", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"25927105300": {"Name": "Guldin S.", "AuthorID": "25927105300", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Simpson Querrey Institute for BioNanotechnology (SQI), Northwestern University"}, "22964377100": {"Name": "Steiner U.", "AuthorID": "22964377100", "AffiliationID": "60106421, 60024631", "AffiliationName": "Adolphe Merkle Institute, University of Fribourg, Chemin des Verdiers"}, "26533431100": {"Name": "Stefik M.", "AuthorID": "26533431100", "AffiliationID": "60018179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of South Carolina"}, "26768199000": {"Name": "Sai H.", "AuthorID": "26768199000", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University"}, "7006467467": {"Name": "Wiesner U.", "AuthorID": "7006467467", "AffiliationID": "60007776", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Cornell University"}}}
