Reporting of results on favourable datasets and sampling error in the estimated performance measures based on single samples are thought to be the major sources of bias in such comparisons. Better performance in one or a few instances does not necessarily imply so on an average or on a population level and simulation studies may be a better alternative for objectively comparing the performances of machine learning algorithms. Methods We compare the classification performance of a number of important and widely used machine learning algorithms, namely the Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN). Using massively parallel processing on high-performance supercomputers, we compare the generalisation errors at various combinations of levels of several factors: number of features, training sample size, biological variation, experimental variation, effect size, replication and correlation between features. Results For smaller number of correlated features, number of features not exceeding approximately half the sample size, LDA was found to be the method of choice in terms of average generalisation errors as well as stability (precision) of error estimates. SVM (with RBF kernel) outperforms LDA as well as RF and kNN by a clear margin as the feature set gets larger provided the sample size is not too small (at least 20). The performance of kNN also improves as the number of features grows and outplays that of LDA and RF unless the data variability is too high and/or effect sizes are too small. RF was found to outperform only kNN in some instances where the data are more variable and have smaller effect sizes, in which cases it also provide more stable error estimates than kNN and LDA. Applications to a number of real datasets supported the findings from the simulation study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cross-validation", "electroencephalogram (EEG)", "generalisation error", "machine learning", "magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "microarrays", "truncated distribution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behavioral Research", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Discriminant Analysis", "Half-Life", "Humans", "Machine Learning", "Mental Health", "Sample Size", "Support Vector Machine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989837065", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"36196573000": {"Name": "Khondoker M.", "AuthorID": "36196573000", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56962718400": {"Name": "Stahl D.", "AuthorID": "56962718400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Department of Biostatistics"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, NIHR Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101619950": {"Name": "Simmons A.", "AuthorID": "7101619950", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520, 60171762", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, NIHR Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16240399100": {"Name": "Skirrow C.", "AuthorID": "16240399100", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre"}}}
