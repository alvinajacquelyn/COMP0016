It can be applied in any context where a particular treatment or intervention is administered according to a pre-specified rule linked to a continuous variable. Such thresholds are common in primary care drug prescription where the RD design can be used to estimate the causal effect of medication in the general population. Such results can then be contrasted to those obtained from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and inform prescription policy and guidelines based on a more realistic and less expensive context. In this paper, we focus on statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, however, the methodology can be applied to many other drugs provided these are prescribed in accordance to pre-determined guidelines. Current guidelines in the UK state that statins should be prescribed to patients with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk scores in excess of 20%. If we consider patients whose risk scores are close to the 20%risk score threshold, we find that there is an element of random variation in both the risk score itself and its measurement. We can therefore consider the threshold as a randomising device that assigns statin prescription to individuals just above the threshold and withholds it from those just below. Thus, we are effectively replicating the conditions of an RCT in the area around the threshold, removing or at least mitigating confounding. We frame the RD design in the language of conditional independence, which clarifies the assumptions necessary to apply an RD design to data, and which makes the links with instrumental variables clear. We also have context-specific knowledge about the expected sizes of the effects of statin prescription and are thus able to incorporate this into Bayesian models by formulating informative priors on our causal parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Causal inference", "Informative priors", "Local average treatment effect", "Regression discontinuity design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Primary Health Care", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Research Design", "Risk Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930371398", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"]], "AuthorData": {"16024682900": {"Name": "Geneletti S.", "AuthorID": "16024682900", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, London School of Economics"}, "52164155000": {"Name": "O'Keeffe A.G.", "AuthorID": "52164155000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6603354734": {"Name": "Baio G.", "AuthorID": "6603354734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7004964663": {"Name": "Sharples L.D.", "AuthorID": "7004964663", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Clinical Trials Research, University of Leeds"}, "7202589117": {"Name": "Richardson S.", "AuthorID": "7202589117", "AffiliationID": "60006654", "AffiliationName": "MRC Biostatistics Unit"}}}
