It is composed of distinct nuclei that have unique long-range connectivity. Accurate thalamic nuclei segmentation provides insights about structural connectivity and the neurodegeneration mechanisms occurring in distinct brain disorders, for instance Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). In this work, we propose a novel thalamic nuclei segmentation approach that relies on tractography, thalamic nuclei priors and local fibre orientation. Validation was performed in a cohort of healthy controls and FTD patients against other thalamus connectivity-based parcellation methods. Results showed that the proposed strategy led to anatomical plausible thalamic nuclei segmentations and was able to detect connectivity differences between controls and FTD patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral cortex", "Frontotemporal dementias", "Healthy controls", "Local fibre orientations", "Long-range connectivities", "Neurodegeneration", "Nuclei segmentation", "Structural connectivity"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053937395", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57170730400": {"Name": "Semedo C.", "AuthorID": "57170730400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC), University College London"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "36931857600": {"Name": "Vos S.", "AuthorID": "36931857600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS), University College London"}, "56198868700": {"Name": "Sudre C.", "AuthorID": "56198868700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences, King\u2019s College London"}, "54390725600": {"Name": "Bocchetta M.", "AuthorID": "54390725600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36351173300": {"Name": "Ribbens A.", "AuthorID": "36351173300", "AffiliationID": "113963398", "AffiliationName": "icometrix"}, "35086839600": {"Name": "Smeets D.", "AuthorID": "35086839600", "AffiliationID": "113963398", "AffiliationName": "icometrix"}}}
