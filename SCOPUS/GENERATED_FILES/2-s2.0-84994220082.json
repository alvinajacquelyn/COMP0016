Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Stem cells reside in niches that provide signals to maintain selfrenewal, and differentiation is viewed as a passive process that depends on loss of access to these signals. Here, we demonstrate that the differentiation of somatic cyst stem cells (CySCs) in the Drosophila testis is actively promoted by PI3K/Tor signaling, as CySCs lacking PI3K/Tor activity cannot differentiate properly.We find that an insulin peptide produced by somatic cells immediately outside of the stem cell niche acts locally to promote somatic differentiation through Insulin-like receptor (InR) activation. These results indicate that there is a local \u2018differentiation\u2019 niche that upregulates PI3K/Tor signaling in the early daughters of CySCs. Finally, we demonstrate that CySCs secrete the Dilp-binding protein ImpL2, the Drosophila homolog of IGFBP7, into the stem cell niche, which blocks InR activation in CySCs. Thus, we show that somatic cell differentiation is controlled by PI3K/Tor signaling downstream of InR and that the local production of positive and negative InR signals regulates the differentiation niche. These results support a model in which leaving the stem cell niche and initiating differentiation are actively induced by signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drosophila", "Insulin", "PI3K", "Stem cell differentiation", "Testis", "Tor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Cell Differentiation", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Male", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Signal Transduction", "Stem Cell Niche", "Stem Cells", "Testis", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994220082", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"6508153062": {"Name": "Amoyel M.", "AuthorID": "6508153062", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "57191855174": {"Name": "Hillion K.H.", "AuthorID": "57191855174", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU School of Medicine"}, "57193907438": {"Name": "Margolis S.R.", "AuthorID": "57193907438", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU School of Medicine"}, "7005857928": {"Name": "Bach E.A.", "AuthorID": "7005857928", "AffiliationID": "60024541, 60002388", "AffiliationName": "Helen L. and Martin S.
