Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Guarantors of Brain.The proliferation and activation of microglial cells is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative conditions. This mechanism is regulated by the activation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), thus providing a target that may prevent the progression of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. However, the study of microglial proliferation in Alzheimer's disease and validation of the efficacy of CSF1R-inhibiting strategies have not yet been reported. In this study we found increased proliferation of microglial cells in human Alzheimer's disease, in line with an increased upregulation of the CSF1R-dependent pro-mitogenic cascade, correlating with disease severity. Using a transgenic model of Alzheimer's-like pathology (APPswe, PSEN1dE9; APP/PS1 mice) we define a CSF1R-dependent progressive increase in microglial proliferation, in the proximity of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques. Prolonged inhibition of CSF1R in APP/PS1 mice by an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor (GW2580) resulted in the blockade of microglial proliferation and the shifting of the microglial inflammatory profile to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Pharmacological targeting of CSF1R in APP/PS1 mice resulted in an improved performance in memory and behavioural tasks and a prevention of synaptic degeneration, although these changes were not correlated with a change in the number of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques. Our results provide the first proof of the efficacy of CSF1R inhibition in models of Alzheimer's disease, and validate the application of a therapeutic strategy aimed at modifying CSF1R activation as a promising approach to tackle microglial activation and the progression of Alzheimer's disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Gliosis", "Inflammation", "Microglia", "Neurodegeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Anisoles", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Progression", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microglia", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Pyrimidines", "Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964632197", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56974414000": {"Name": "Olmos-Alonso A.", "AuthorID": "56974414000", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, South Lab and Path Block, Mail Point 840 LD80C, Southampton General Hospital"}, "56072636600": {"Name": "Schetters S.T.T.", "AuthorID": "56072636600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, South Lab and Path Block, Mail Point 840 LD80C, Southampton General Hospital"}, "55647231900": {"Name": "Sri S.", "AuthorID": "55647231900", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, South Lab and Path Block, Mail Point 840 LD80C, Southampton General Hospital"}, "57189001823": {"Name": "Askew K.", "AuthorID": "57189001823", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, South Lab and Path Block, Mail Point 840 LD80C, Southampton General Hospital"}, "36157159300": {"Name": "Mancuso R.", "AuthorID": "36157159300", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, South Lab and Path Block, Mail Point 840 LD80C, Southampton General Hospital"}, "6603252004": {"Name": "Vargas-Caballero M.", "AuthorID": "6603252004", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7101787946": {"Name": "Perry V.H.", "AuthorID": "7101787946", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, South Lab and Path Block, Mail Point 840 LD80C, Southampton General Hospital"}, "12796125600": {"Name": "Gomez-Nicola D.", "AuthorID": "12796125600", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Southampton, South Lab and Path Block, Mail Point 840 LD80C, Southampton General Hospital"}, "55172440800": {"Name": "Holscher C.", "AuthorID": "55172440800", "AffiliationID": "60117609, 60117607, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Faculty of Health and Medicine, Lancaster University"}}}
