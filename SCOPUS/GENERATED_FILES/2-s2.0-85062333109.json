While recognizing Colquhoun as the \u201cauthor of the system,\u201d Bentham brought his own utilitarian philosophy to bear on the task, and his arguments shed light on the twin role of licensing in both providing the finance necessary for an expansion of police and in generating a flow of information for use in deterring, detecting, and apprehending criminals. The Police Gazette and the Calendar of Delinquency were to be official publications of the proposed Board of Police, which combined the promulgation of information (thus increasing public knowledge through the understanding) with the effort to mould public opinion (thus influencing the will). Dissemination of facts provided grist to the existing moral sanction\u2019s mill and facilitated cooperation between the people and the agents of penal law. In reaction to anxiety about contagion from revolutionary France, Bentham also explicitly seeks to guide and direct public opinion, thus connecting his police writings directly with the esoteric elements of indirect legislation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bentham", "Colquhoun", "indirect legislation", "police", "prevention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062333109", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"24471848700": {"Name": "Quinn M.", "AuthorID": "24471848700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bentham Project, UCL Faculty of Laws, Bentham House"}}}
