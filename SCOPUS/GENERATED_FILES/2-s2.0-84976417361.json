In the United Kingdom, the predominant source of opioids is primary care prescription. The objective was to examine changes in the incidence, length, and opioid potency of long-term prescribing episodes for musculoskeletal conditions in UK primary care (2002-2013). This was an observational database study (Clinical Practice Research Datalink, 190 practices). Participants (\u226518 years) were prescribed an opioid for a musculoskeletal condition (no opioid prescribed in previous 6 months), and issued \u22652 opioid prescriptions within 90 days (long-term episode). Opioids were divided into short- and long-acting noncontrolled and controlled drugs. Annual incidence of long-term opioid episodes was determined, and for those still in a long-term episode, the percentage of patients prescribed each type 1 to 2 years, and >2 years after initiation. Annual denominator population varied from 1.25 to 1.38 m. A total of 76,416 patients started 1 long-term episode. Annual long-term episode incidence increased (2002-2009) by 38% (42.4-58.3 per 10,000 person-years), remaining stable to 2011, then decreasing slightly to 55.8/10,000 (2013). Patients prescribed long-acting controlled opioids within the first 90 days of long-term use increased from 2002 to 2013 (2.3%-9.9%). In those still in a long-term opioid episode (>2 years), long-acting controlled opioid prescribing increased from 3.5% to 22.6%. This study has uniquely shown an increase in prescribing long-term opioids to 2009, gradually decreasing from 2011 in the United Kingdom. The trend was towards increased prescribing of controlled long-acting opioids and earlier use. Further research into the risks and benefits of opioids is required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analgesic", "Long-term care", "Musculoskeletal pain", "Opioid", "Prescriptions", "Trends"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analgesics, Opioid", "Chronic Pain", "Databases, Factual", "Drug Prescriptions", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Musculoskeletal Pain", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976417361", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"8296644500": {"Name": "Bedson J.", "AuthorID": "8296644500", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "57213551952": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57213551952", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "36084305200": {"Name": "Hayward R.A.", "AuthorID": "36084305200", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "49861004600": {"Name": "Ashworth J.", "AuthorID": "49861004600", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "7102057417": {"Name": "Dunn K.M.", "AuthorID": "7102057417", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "7202962881": {"Name": "Jordan K.P.", "AuthorID": "7202962881", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Primary Care Centre, Research Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University"}, "8214276000": {"Name": "Walters K.", "AuthorID": "8214276000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL"}}}
