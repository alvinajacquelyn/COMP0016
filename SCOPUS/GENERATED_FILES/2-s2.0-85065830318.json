For example, semiconductors and metals of sub-10 nm thicknesses have been realized. Then, the graphene paradigm inspired a plethora of other 2D and quasi-2D materials. In this new era, materials have transcended beyond the traditional thin films to a domain of atomic-scale thicknesses, unleashing vast and unexplored possibilities for light-matter interactions. This Optical Materials Express virtual issue features a collection of thirty-five papers aiming to capture the current state-of-the art, trends and open research directions in photonics with ultrathin and atomically thin materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atomic layer", "Atomic scale", "Light-matter interactions", "Quasi-2d", "State of the art", "Thin materials", "Ultra-thin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065830318", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"6508354910": {"Name": "Foteinopoulou S.", "AuthorID": "6508354910", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of New Mexico"}, "6603284526": {"Name": "Subramania G.", "AuthorID": "6603284526", "AffiliationID": "60007843", "AffiliationName": "Sandia National Laboratories"}, "7004097868": {"Name": "Panoiu N.", "AuthorID": "7004097868", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005627097": {"Name": "Shalaev V.", "AuthorID": "7005627097", "AffiliationID": "60009254", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Birck Nanotechnology Center, Purdue University"}}}
