Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.We describe BiopLib, a mature C programming library for manipulating protein structure, and BiopTools, a set of command-line tools which exploit BiopLib. The library also provides a small number of functions for handling protein sequence and general purpose programming and mathematics. BiopLib transparently handles PDBML (XML) format and standard PDB files. BiopTools provides facilities ranging from renumbering atoms and residues to calculation of solvent accessibility.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Databases, Protein", "Protein Conformation", "Sequence Analysis, Protein", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950255812", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"7202932732": {"Name": "Porter C.", "AuthorID": "7202932732", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London, Darwin Building"}, "55708401700": {"Name": "Martin A.", "AuthorID": "55708401700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London, Darwin Building"}}}
