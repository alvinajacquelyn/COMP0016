In this paper, we provide three distinct families of bipartite graphs that have Sidorenko's property. First, using branching random walks, we develop an embedding algorithm which allows us to prove that bipartite graphs admitting a certain type of tree decomposition have Sidorenko's property. Second, we use the concept of locally dense graphs to prove that subdivisions of certain graphs, including cliques, have Sidorenko's property. Third, we prove that if H has Sidorenko's property, then the Cartesian product of H with an even cycle also has Sidorenko's property.", "AuthorKeywords": ["05C35 (primary)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054159449", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"17433337400": {"Name": "Conlon D.", "AuthorID": "17433337400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "57093209000": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "57093209000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford"}, "56812885500": {"Name": "Kim J.H.", "AuthorID": "56812885500", "AffiliationID": "60009851", "AffiliationName": "School of Computational Sciences, Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS)"}, "35196143100": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "35196143100", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, MIT"}}}
