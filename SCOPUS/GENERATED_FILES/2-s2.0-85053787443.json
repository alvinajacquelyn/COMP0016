One example, the EU TPD health warning states, \u201cThis product contains nicotine which is a highly addictive substance. [It is not recommended for use by non-smokers]\u201d. The impact of the EU TPD warning message on intentions to use, has not been explored within an EU population. Aims: Examine the effect of i) the TPD e-cigarette health warning and ii) an alternative relative risk message, on smokers\u2019 willingness to use, likelihood of purchase, and intention to use as a quit aid. Methods: Cross-sectional online study. Ninety-five smokers (55 males; 18\u201355 years old) were randomly allocated to one of three conditions and viewed ten individually presented e-cigarettes images with either no message, TPD message, or relative risk message. Participants rated i) willingness to use, and likelihood of: ii) purchase, iii) using in the next month, and iv) using in a quit attempt, before and after viewing the images. Results: For willingness to use and likelihood of purchase, ANCOVAs showed a significant main effect of Message Type (ps, <.05); ratings were lower in the TPD condition. Message type, however did not significantly change likelihood of using in the next month or using in a quit attempt. Conclusions: Preliminary findings suggest that the TPD e-cigarette health warning may reduce smokers\u2019 willingness to use and likelihood of purchasing an e-cigarette. Messages conveying reduced harm or indeed, no message at all, may be more effective in encouraging smokers to switch to these lower risk products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["E-cigarettes", "Health messages", "Health warning", "Nicotine", "Smoking"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053787443", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57191226819": {"Name": "Cox S.", "AuthorID": "57191226819", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, School of Applied Sciences, London South Bank University"}, "14008980700": {"Name": "Frings D.", "AuthorID": "14008980700", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, School of Applied Sciences, London South Bank University"}, "57203956639": {"Name": "Ahmed R.", "AuthorID": "57203956639", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, School of Applied Sciences, London South Bank University"}, "6506951935": {"Name": "Dawkins L.", "AuthorID": "6506951935", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Behaviours Research, School of Applied Sciences, London South Bank University"}}}
