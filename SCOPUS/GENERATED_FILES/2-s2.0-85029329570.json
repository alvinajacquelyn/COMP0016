Foraminifera of the genus Melonis appear to be promising candidates for temperature reconstructions due to their wide geographical and bathymetric distribution, and their infaunal habitat, which was suggested to reduce secondary effects from carbonate ion saturation (\u0394[CO32\u2212]). Here, we make substantial advances to previous calibration efforts and present new multi-lab Mg/Ca data for Melonis barleeanum and Melonis pompilioides from more than one hundred core top samples spanning in situ bottom temperatures from \u22121 to 16 \u00b0C, coupled with morphometric analyses of the foraminifer tests. Both species and their morphotypes seem to have a similar response of Mg/Ca to growth temperature. Compilation of new and previously published data reveals a linear dependence of temperature on Mg/Ca, with a best fit of Mg/Ca (mmol/mol) = 0.113 \u00b1 0.005 \u2217 BWT (\u00b0C) + 0.792 \u00b1 0.036 (r2 = 0.81; n = 120; 1\u03c3 SD). Salinity, bottom water \u0394[CO32\u2212], and varying morphotypes have no apparent effect on the Mg/Ca-temperature relationship, but pore water \u0394[CO32\u2212] might have had an influence on some of the samples from the tropical Atlantic.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benthic foraminifera", "Deep-sea temperature reconstruction", "Melonis barleeanum", "Melonis pompilioides", "Mg/Ca paleothermometry", "Paleoceanography", "Temperature calibration"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029329570", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"56455011000": {"Name": "Hasenfratz A.", "AuthorID": "56455011000", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geological Sciences and Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern"}, "7003987385": {"Name": "Haug G.", "AuthorID": "7003987385", "AffiliationID": "60005076", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"}, "16402244600": {"Name": "Jaccard S.", "AuthorID": "16402244600", "AffiliationID": "60020486", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geological Sciences and Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research, University of Bern"}, "57203352997": {"Name": "Schiebel R.", "AuthorID": "57203352997", "AffiliationID": "60005076", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"}, "16316552900": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Garc\u00eda A.", "AuthorID": "16316552900", "AffiliationID": "60005076", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Chemistry"}, "6504504125": {"Name": "Thornalley D.", "AuthorID": "6504504125", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "55606326400": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6nfeld J.", "AuthorID": "55606326400", "AffiliationID": "60079129", "AffiliationName": "GEOMAR \u2013 Helmholtz-Centre for Ocean Research Kiel"}, "6701770493": {"Name": "Holbourn A.", "AuthorID": "6701770493", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University"}, "7004639328": {"Name": "Kuhnt W.", "AuthorID": "7004639328", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geosciences, Christian-Albrechts-University"}, "7103378742": {"Name": "Jennings A.", "AuthorID": "7103378742", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado"}, "6602784417": {"Name": "Marchitto T.", "AuthorID": "6602784417", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado"}, "36572626200": {"Name": "Quillmann U.", "AuthorID": "36572626200", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences and Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado"}, "7003599727": {"Name": "Lear C.", "AuthorID": "7003599727", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "7004679498": {"Name": "Rosenthal Y.", "AuthorID": "7004679498", "AffiliationID": "60119141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Rutgers University"}, "56874090500": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "56874090500", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Earth Sciences, The Australian National University"}}}
