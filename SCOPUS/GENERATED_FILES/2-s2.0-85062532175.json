Such communications can potentially be overheard by one or multiple eavesdroppers. Our goal is to design an artificial noise (AN)-aided transmit strategy in order to enhance security against eavesdropping. We propose a communication design where the potential eavesdroppers are deactivated by means of jamming operations performed by 1) an In-Band Full Duplex (IBFD) IoT-GW and/or by 2) cooperative helpers featuring multiple antennas. We show that the solution where only the IBFD IoT-GW generates AN is feasible for small IoT networks and when a neutralization zone around each IoT-device is assumed. In the case with helpers instead, we show that the Average number of Secure Connections (ASC) increases at least exponentially with the density of the helpers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Artificial noise", "Average numbers", "Communication design", "Full-duplex", "In-band", "IOT networks", "Multiple antenna", "Uplink communication"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062532175", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"36104981800": {"Name": "Iellamo S.", "AuthorID": "36104981800", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60112307", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, LIP6"}, "56388738300": {"Name": "Guiazon R.", "AuthorID": "56388738300", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds, Experimental Quantum Information Group"}, "57203071179": {"Name": "Coupechoux M.", "AuthorID": "57203071179", "AffiliationID": "60072950", "AffiliationName": "LTCI, CNRS, Telecom ParisTech, University Paris-Saclay"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EEE Department, University College London"}}}
