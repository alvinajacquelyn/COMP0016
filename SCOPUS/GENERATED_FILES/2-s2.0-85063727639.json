Mercury (Hg) exposure poses substantial risks to human health. Investigating a longer chain from economic activities to human health can reveal the sources and critical processes of Hg-related health risks. Thus, we develop a more comprehensive assessment method which is applied to mainland China\u2014the largest global Hg emitter. We present a map of Hg-related health risks in China and estimate that 0.14 points of per-foetus intelligence quotient (IQ) decrements and 7,360 deaths from fatal heart attacks are related to the intake of methylmercury in 2010. This study, for the first time, reveals the significant impacts of interprovincial trade on Hg-related health risks across the whole country. For instance, interprovincial trade induced by final consumption prevents 0.39 \u00d7 10 \u22122 points for per-foetus IQ decrements and 194 deaths from fatal heart attacks. These findings highlight the importance of policy decisions in different stages of economic supply chains to reduce Hg-related health risks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Air Pollutants", "China", "Environmental Monitoring", "Humans", "Intelligence Tests", "Mercury", "Methylmercury Compounds", "Public Health", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063727639", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55362895000": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "55362895000", "AffiliationID": "60021200, 60130184", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science (Ministry of Education), School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University"}, "56327161000": {"Name": "Tang X.", "AuthorID": "56327161000", "AffiliationID": "60021200, 60130184", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science (Ministry of Education), School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University"}, "7102477239": {"Name": "Shu J.", "AuthorID": "7102477239", "AffiliationID": "60021200, 60130184", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Geographic Information Science (Ministry of Education), School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University"}, "36453970600": {"Name": "Liang S.", "AuthorID": "36453970600", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University"}, "23502643300": {"Name": "Yi Y.", "AuthorID": "23502643300", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University"}, "57204957434": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57204957434", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University"}, "57208080766": {"Name": "Qi J.", "AuthorID": "57208080766", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University"}, "7405433398": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "7405433398", "AffiliationID": "60007155", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Environmental and Ecological Engineering, Guangdong University of Technology"}, "57189870268": {"Name": "Liu M.", "AuthorID": "57189870268", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Process, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "57190491740": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57190491740", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Process, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "7501856188": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "7501856188", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Process, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "57205068435": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57205068435", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge"}, "36572754800": {"Name": "Tong Y.", "AuthorID": "36572754800", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "7409434486": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "7409434486", "AffiliationID": "60014402", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment and Natural Resources, Renmin University of China"}}}
