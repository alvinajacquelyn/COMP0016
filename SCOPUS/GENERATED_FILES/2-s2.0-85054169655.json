There is uncertainty in the role of complete coronary revascularization in this group of patients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes of complete revascularization compared with culprit vessel\u2013only intervention in a large contemporary cohort of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for NSTEMI. Methods: The authors undertook an observational cohort study of 37,491 NSTEMI patients treated between 2005 and 2015 at the 8 heart attack centers in London. Clinical details were recorded at the time of the procedure into local databases using the British Cardiac Intervention Society (BCIS) PCI dataset. A total of 21,857 patients (58.3%) presented with NSTEMI and MVD. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at a median follow-up of 4.1 years (interquartile range: 2.2 to 5.8 years). Results: A total of 11,737 (53.7%) patients underwent single-stage complete revascularization during PCI for NSTEMI, rates that significantly increased during the study period (p = 0.006). Those patients undergoing complete revascularization were older and more likely to be male, diabetic, have renal disease and a history of previous myocardial infarction/revascularization compared with the culprit-only revascularization group. Although crude, in-hospital major adverse cardiac event rates were similar (5.2% vs. 4.8%; p = 0.462) between the 2 groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significant differences in mortality rates between the 2 groups (22.5% complete revascularization vs. 25.9% culprit vessel intervention; p = 0.0005) during the follow-up period. After multivariate Cox analysis (hazard ratio: 0.90; 95% confidence interval: 0.85 to 0.97) and the use of propensity matching (hazard ratio: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.76 to 0.98) complete revascularization was associated with reduced mortality. Conclusions: In NSTEMI patients with MVD, despite higher initial (in-hospital) mortality rates, single-stage complete coronary revascularization appears to be superior to culprit-only vessel PCI in terms of long-term mortality rates. This supports the need for further randomized study to confirm these findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["multivessel intervention", "myocardial infarction", "NSTEMI", "PCI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Coronary Vessels", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hospital Mortality", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Myocardial Revascularization", "Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction", "Percutaneous Coronary Intervention", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054169655", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"27867977800": {"Name": "Rathod K.S.", "AuthorID": "27867977800", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "37018431500": {"Name": "Koganti S.", "AuthorID": "37018431500", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "56347651700": {"Name": "Jain A.K.", "AuthorID": "56347651700", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "26644292900": {"Name": "O'Mahony C.", "AuthorID": "26644292900", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7202380964": {"Name": "Knight C.J.", "AuthorID": "7202380964", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7201657327": {"Name": "Mathur A.", "AuthorID": "7201657327", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "24077375900": {"Name": "Sirker A.", "AuthorID": "24077375900", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7408612732": {"Name": "Smith E.J.", "AuthorID": "7408612732", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7006779954": {"Name": "Wragg A.", "AuthorID": "7006779954", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "55568508950": {"Name": "Jones D.A.", "AuthorID": "55568508950", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "6504019447": {"Name": "Astroulakis Z.", "AuthorID": "6504019447", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60032542", "AffiliationName": "St. George's Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, St. George's Hospital"}, "7202592409": {"Name": "Lim P.", "AuthorID": "7202592409", "AffiliationID": "60010426, 60032542", "AffiliationName": "St. George's Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, St. George's Hospital"}, "6603035925": {"Name": "Rakhit R.", "AuthorID": "6603035925", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "46761159400": {"Name": "Kalra S.S.", "AuthorID": "46761159400", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57191218859": {"Name": "Dalby M.C.", "AuthorID": "57191218859", "AffiliationID": "60024930, 60022023", "AffiliationName": "Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, Harefield Hospital, Middlesex"}, "8874031800": {"Name": "Malik I.S.", "AuthorID": "8874031800", "AffiliationID": "60020416, 60111785", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Hammersmith Hospital"}, "7004926172": {"Name": "Redwood S.", "AuthorID": "7004926172", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "St. Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust, Guys & St. Thomas Hospital"}, "7004217635": {"Name": "MacCarthy P.A.", "AuthorID": "7004217635", "AffiliationID": "60021923, 60029685", "AffiliationName": "Kings College Hospital, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill"}}}
