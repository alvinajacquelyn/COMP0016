All rights reserved.In this paper we present a single-image phase retrieval algorithm for multi-material samples, developed for the edge illumination (EI) X-ray phase contrast imaging method. The theoretical derivation is provided, along with any assumptions made. The algorithm is evaluated quantitatively using both simulated and experimental results from a computed tomography (CT) scan using the EI laboratory implementation. Qualitative CT results are provided for a biological sample containing both bone and soft-tissue. Using a single EI image per projection and knowledge of the complex refractive index, the algorithm can accurately retrieve the interface between a given pair of materials. A composite CT slice can be created by splicing together multiple CT reconstructions, each retrieved for a different pair of materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biological samples", "Complex refractive index", "Computed tomography scan", "CT reconstruction", "Phase retrieval algorithm", "Theoretical derivations", "X-ray phase tomography", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019223123", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56954731500": {"Name": "Zamir A.", "AuthorID": "56954731500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "35733519000": {"Name": "Diemoz P.", "AuthorID": "35733519000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "55320675800": {"Name": "Vittoria F.", "AuthorID": "55320675800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}}}
