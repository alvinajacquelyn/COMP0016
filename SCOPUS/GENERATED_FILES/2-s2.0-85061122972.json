Absolute quantification in targeted proteomics is challenging due to a variety of factors, including low specificity in complex backgrounds, limited analytical throughput, and wide dynamic range. To address these problems, we developed a hybrid offset-triggered multiplex absolute quantification (HOTMAQ) strategy that combines cost-effective mass difference and isobaric tags to enable simultaneous construction of an internal standard curve in the MS 1 precursor scan, real-time identification of peptides at the MS 2 level, and mass offset-triggered accurate quantification of target proteins in synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS 3 spectra. This approach increases the analytical throughput of targeted quantitative proteomics by up to 12-fold. The HOTMAQ strategy was employed to verify candidate protein biomarkers in preclinical Alzheimer's disease with high accuracy. The greatly enhanced throughput and quantitative performance, paired with sample flexibility, makes HOTMAQ broadly applicable to targeted peptidomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absolute quantification", "Accurate quantifications", "Alzheimer's disease", "Complex background", "Quantitative proteomics", "Real-time identification", "Targeted proteomics", "Wide dynamic range"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061122972", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"]], "AuthorData": {"57197794336": {"Name": "Zhong X.", "AuthorID": "57197794336", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "57205501110": {"Name": "Yu Q.", "AuthorID": "57205501110", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "57196321581": {"Name": "Ma F.", "AuthorID": "57196321581", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "24779513400": {"Name": "Frost D.", "AuthorID": "24779513400", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "57145413300": {"Name": "Lu L.", "AuthorID": "57145413300", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "35234014600": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "35234014600", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "56713975200": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "56713975200", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "7103143605": {"Name": "Carlsson C.", "AuthorID": "7103143605", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin"}, "15049910000": {"Name": "Okonkwo O.", "AuthorID": "15049910000", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin"}}}
