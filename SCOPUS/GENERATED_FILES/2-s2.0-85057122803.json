The design based on Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer framework was validated on stroke survivors and healthy subjects performing three elementary arm movements (reach and retrieve, lift arm, rotate arm), involved in 'making-a-cup-of-tea' an archetypal daily activity, achieved an overall accuracy of 78% and 85% respectively. The design coded in System Verilog, was synthesized using STMicroelectronics 130 nm technology, occupies 340K NAND2 equivalent area and consumes 292 nW @ 150 Hz, besides being functionally verified up to 25 MHz making it suitable for real-time high speed operations. The orientation, arm position and the joint angle, are computed on-the-fly, with the classification performed at the end of movement duration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["activity recognition", "classification", "CORDIC", "MARG sensor", "quaternion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activity recognition", "Co-ordinate rotation digital computers", "CORDIC", "Gradient Descent method", "High-speed operation", "Kinematic properties", "Marg sensors", "quaternion"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057122803", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55576295700": {"Name": "Biswas D.", "AuthorID": "55576295700", "AffiliationID": "60070034", "AffiliationName": "IMEC"}, "57204771267": {"Name": "Ye Z.", "AuthorID": "57204771267", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Electronics and Computer Science"}, "55904125700": {"Name": "Maharatna K.", "AuthorID": "55904125700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Electronics and Computer Science"}, "35097627900": {"Name": "Mazomenos E.", "AuthorID": "35097627900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Centre for Medical Image Computing"}, "6506114179": {"Name": "J\u00f6bges M.", "AuthorID": "6506114179", "AffiliationID": "100780407", "AffiliationName": "Brandenburg Klinik"}}}
