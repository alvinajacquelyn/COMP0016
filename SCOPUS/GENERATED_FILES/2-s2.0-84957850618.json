The time-scale of 3 \u03bcs to 1 ms associated with the flame-kernel evolution stage of an ignition event is targeted in this work. A CH4/air mixture (equivalence ratio \u03c6 = 0.6) is studied as a base case, and compared with CH4/CO2/air (mole fractions = 0.059/0.029/0.912, respectively) and CH4/H2/air (mole fractions = 0.053/0.016/0.931, respectively) mixtures for nearly the same adiabatic flame temperature of 1649 K. The spatio-temporal flame-kernel evolution is imaged using planar laser induced fluorescence of the OH radical (OH-PLIF), simultaneously with H-alpha emission from the plasma. The H-alpha emission suggests that the plasma time-scale is well below 1 \u03bcs. The PLIF images indicate all the stages of kernel development from the elongated kernel to the toroidal formations and the subsequent appearance of a front-lobe. The different time-scales associated with these stages are identified from the rate of change of the kernel perimeter. The plasma is followed by a supersonic kernel-perimeter growth. Larger flame-kernel spread is found in the case of CH4/H2 mixtures. A distinct shift in the trends of evolution of LIF intensity and kernel perimeter is observed as the fuel concentration is varied near the lean flammability limit in CH4/air (\u03c6 = 0.35-0.65) and H2/air (\u03c6 = 0.05-0.31) mixtures. The flow velocity (Reynolds number, Re) effect in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes (Re = ~600-6000) indicates that the shape of the flame-kernel changes at higher velocities, but the size of the kernel does not change significantly for a given time from the moment of ignition. This could be due to a balance between two competing effects, namely, increase in the strain rate that causes local extinction and thus decreases the flame-kernel growth, and increase in the turbulence levels that facilitates increased flame-kernel surface area through wrinkling, which in turn increases the flame-kernel growth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flame-kernel", "H-alpha", "Laser ignition", "Laser induced spark", "OH PLIF"], "IndexKeywords": ["Flame kernel", "H-alpha", "Laser ignition", "Laser-induced sparks", "OH PLIF"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957850618", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36698255800": {"Name": "Mulla I.A.", "AuthorID": "36698255800", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60025927, 60122705", "AffiliationName": "CORIA-UMR6614, CNRS, INSA de Rouen"}, "10640872700": {"Name": "Balachandran R.", "AuthorID": "10640872700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005330065": {"Name": "Chakravarthy S.R.", "AuthorID": "7005330065", "AffiliationID": "60025757", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras"}, "7006077081": {"Name": "Swaminathan N.", "AuthorID": "7006077081", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering, Cambridge University"}}}
