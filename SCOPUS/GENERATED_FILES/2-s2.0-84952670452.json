All rights reserved.Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a key mediator involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, acting predominantly on two receptor types; cell surface IP receptor and cytosolic peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b2/\u03b4. Having a very short half-life, direct methods to determine its long term effects on cells is difficult, and little is known of its interactions with nuclear receptors. Here we used computational chemistry methods to investigate the potential for PGI2, beraprost (IP receptor agonist), and GW0742 (PPAR\u03b2/\u03b4 agonist), to bind to nuclear receptors, confirmed with pharmacological methods. In silico screening predicted that PGI2, beraprost, and GW0742 have the potential to bind to different nuclear receptors, in particular thyroid hormone \u03b2 receptor (TR\u03b2) and thyroid hormone \u03b1 receptor (TR\u03b1). Docking analysis predicts a binding profile to residues thought to have allosteric control on the TR ligand binding site. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that beraprost and GW0742 display TR\u03b2 and TR\u03b1 antagonistic properties; beraprost IC50 6.3 \u00d7 10-5 mol/L and GW0742 IC50 4.9 \u00d7 10-6 mol/L. Changes to triiodothyronine (T3) induced vasodilation of rat mesenteric arteries measured on the wire myograph were measured in the presence of the TR antagonist MLS000389544 (10-5 mol/L), beraprost (10-5 mol/L) and GW0742 (10-5 mol/L); all significantly inhibited T3 induced vasodilation compared to controls. We have shown that both beraprost and GW0742 exhibit TR\u03b2 and TR\u03b1 antagonist behaviour, and suggests that PGI2 has the ability to affect the long term function of cells through binding to and inactivating thyroid hormone receptors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beraprost", "Mesenteric artery", "PPAR", "Prostacyclin", "Thyroid hormone", "Triiodothyronine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Binding, Competitive", "Computer Simulation", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Epoprostenol", "Humans", "Ligands", "Male", "Mesenteric Arteries", "Models, Molecular", "Myography", "Protein Domains", "Rats, Wistar", "Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear", "Receptors, Thyroid Hormone", "Thiazoles", "Thyroid Hormone Receptors alpha", "Thyroid Hormone Receptors beta", "Triiodothyronine", "Vasodilation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952670452", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"57031819000": {"Name": "Perez Diaz N.", "AuthorID": "57031819000", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "6603596752": {"Name": "Zloh M.", "AuthorID": "6603596752", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "54407349800": {"Name": "Patel P.", "AuthorID": "54407349800", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "55848844700": {"Name": "MacKenzie L.", "AuthorID": "55848844700", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
