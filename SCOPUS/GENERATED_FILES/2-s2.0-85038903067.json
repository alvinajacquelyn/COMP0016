Given one or many images as input, the desired output of these methods is usually a spatially smooth assignment of labels. The large amount of such computer vision problems has lead to significant research efforts, with the state of art moving from CRF-based approaches to deep CNNs and more recently, hybrids of the two. Although these approaches have significantly advanced the state of the art, the vast majority has solely focused on improving quantitative results and are not designed for low-compute scenarios. In this paper, we present a new general framework for a variety of computer vision labeling tasks, called HashMatch. Our approach is designed to be both fully parallel, i.e. each pixel is independently processed, and low-compute, with a model complexity an order of magnitude less than existing CNN and CRF-based approaches. We evaluate HashMatch extensively on several problems such as disparity estimation, image retrieval, feature approximation and background subtraction, for which HashMatch achieves high computational efficiency while producing high quality results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Background subtraction", "Computer vision problems", "Depth Estimation", "Disparity estimations", "Feature approximation", "Parallel computer", "Quantitative result", "Spatially smoothes"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038903067", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"36170215300": {"Name": "Fanello S.R.", "AuthorID": "36170215300", "AffiliationID": "120210903", "AffiliationName": "PerceptiveIO"}, "55194433600": {"Name": "Valentin J.", "AuthorID": "55194433600", "AffiliationID": "120210903", "AffiliationName": "PerceptiveIO"}, "35173101000": {"Name": "Kowdle A.", "AuthorID": "35173101000", "AffiliationID": "120210903", "AffiliationName": "PerceptiveIO"}, "8380954300": {"Name": "Rhemann C.", "AuthorID": "8380954300", "AffiliationID": "120210903", "AffiliationName": "PerceptiveIO"}, "57190443348": {"Name": "Tankovich V.", "AuthorID": "57190443348", "AffiliationID": "120210903", "AffiliationName": "PerceptiveIO"}, "7202139211": {"Name": "Davidson P.", "AuthorID": "7202139211", "AffiliationID": "120210903", "AffiliationName": "PerceptiveIO"}, "16426108500": {"Name": "Izadi S.", "AuthorID": "16426108500", "AffiliationID": "120210903", "AffiliationName": "PerceptiveIO"}, "54792616700": {"Name": "Ciliberto C.", "AuthorID": "54792616700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
