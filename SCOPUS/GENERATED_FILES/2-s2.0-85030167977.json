Quantum contextuality has been recently shown to be a resource for quantum computation with magic states for odd-prime dimensional qudits and two-dimensional systems with real wave functions. The phenomenon of state-independent contextuality poses a priori an obstruction to characterizing the case of regular qubits, the fundamental building block of quantum computation. Here, we establish contextuality of magic states as a necessary resource for a large class of quantum computation schemes on qubits. We illustrate our result with a concrete scheme related to measurement-based quantum computation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Contextuality", "Fundamental building blocks", "Measurement-based quantum computation", "Models of quantum computations", "Odd prime", "Speed up", "Two-dimensional systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030167977", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55965039200": {"Name": "Bermejo-Vega J.", "AuthorID": "55965039200", "AffiliationID": "60029010", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck Institut f\u00fcr Quantum Optics, Theory Division"}, "48161032700": {"Name": "Delfosse N.", "AuthorID": "48161032700", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California"}, "7102407945": {"Name": "Browne D.E.", "AuthorID": "7102407945", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56374748800": {"Name": "Okay C.", "AuthorID": "56374748800", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Western Ontario"}, "6507222166": {"Name": "Raussendorf R.", "AuthorID": "6507222166", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of British Columbia"}}}
