Many pathological processes may have similar appearances in life and following death. A thorough knowledge of normal postmortem changes is therefore required within postmortem magnetic resonance imaging to ensure that these are not mistakenly interpreted as significant pathology. Similarly, some changes that are interpreted as pathological if they occur during life may be artefacts on postmortem magnetic resonance imaging that are of limited significance. This review serves to illustrate briefly those postmortem magnetic resonance imaging changes as part of the normal changes after death in fetuses and children, and highlight imaging findings that may confuse or mislead an observer to identifying pathology where none is present.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Children", "Fetus", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Pathology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autopsy", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Netherlands", "Pediatrics", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Reference Values", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926196582", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56443405000": {"Name": "Barber J.L.", "AuthorID": "56443405000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.M.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}}}
