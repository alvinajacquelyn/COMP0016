Here we document a major (~1%) decrease in the Mg isotopic composition of the reaction front of an exhumed contact between rocks of subducted crust and serpentinite in the Syros m\u00e9 lange zone. This isotopic perturbation extends over a notable length scale (~1 m), implicating diffusion of Mg through an intergranular fluid network over a period of ~100 kyr. These novel observations confirm models of diffusion-controlled growth of reaction zones formed between rocks of contrasting compositions, such as found at the slab-mantle interface in subduction zones. The results also demonstrate that diffusive processes can result in exotic stable isotope compositions of major elements with implications for mantle xenoliths and complex intrusions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusion", "Isotope", "Metasomatism", "Monomineralic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922423857", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"57204707349": {"Name": "Pogge von Strandmann P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204707349", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36681117900": {"Name": "Dohmen R.", "AuthorID": "36681117900", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Institut F\u00fcr Geologie, Mineralogie und Geophysik, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum"}, "7006455699": {"Name": "Marschall H.R.", "AuthorID": "7006455699", "AffiliationID": "60013609", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology and Geophysics, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution"}, "56214911500": {"Name": "Schumacher J.C.", "AuthorID": "56214911500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Isotope Group, School of Earth Sciences, Bristol University"}, "22940400900": {"Name": "Elliott T.", "AuthorID": "22940400900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Isotope Group, School of Earth Sciences, Bristol University"}}}
