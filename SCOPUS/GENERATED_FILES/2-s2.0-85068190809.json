It was originally designed for use with business emails; however, the latest iteration of the tagger can be applied to other datasets\u2013such as personal correspondence\u2013providing a useful resource for the corpus linguistics community. In this study, the speech act tagger is tested on a collection of letters written by Irish migrants at the end of the nineteenth century. After discussing issues to do with the digitisation, transcription and annotation of historical migrant correspondence, the article will report on the results of this trial study, demonstrating how the tagger can perform with some success even on corpora with very different characteristics. Although the dataset used for this trial study is small, the findings show the potential for carrying out this type of analysis across larger digital archives allowing for different datasets to be compared, taking into consideration sociobiographic variables such as the author\u2019s sex, class and role within the notional familial hierarchy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["corpus linguistics", "correspondence corpora", "Historical migrant letters", "speech acts"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068190809", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"52163504300": {"Name": "De Felice R.", "AuthorID": "52163504300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of English Language and Literature, University College London"}, "55440575900": {"Name": "Moreton E.", "AuthorID": "55440575900", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "School of Humanities, Coventry University"}}}
