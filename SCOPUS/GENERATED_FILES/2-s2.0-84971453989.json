By loading two horizontal T shaped slots at either effective lengths of the patch antenna, 12% fractional bandwidth at 5.55GHz center frequency has been been achieved. The DGS technique has also been used to improve the T-squared patch antenna cross-polarization level by 9 dB.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Center frequency", "Cross polarizations", "Cross-polarization level", "Defected ground plane", "Effective length", "Fractional bandwidths", "Shaped slots", "Wide-band"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971453989", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"56030050300": {"Name": "Tanha M.", "AuthorID": "56030050300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35087329300": {"Name": "Brennan P.", "AuthorID": "35087329300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
