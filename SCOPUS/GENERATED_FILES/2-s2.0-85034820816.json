Extension of this AACVD method whereby related precursors of the type, [R2M(OC(Me)CHC(Me)N(iPr))] (R = Et, M = Al (2); R = Me, M = Ga (3)), isolated as oils, were added to the precursor solution allowed for the deposition of aluminium- and gallium-doped ZnO (AZO and GZO) films, respectively. Complexes 1\u20133 were characterised by elemental analysis, NMR and mass spectrometry. Films were deposited in under 30 min at 400 \u00b0C, from CH2Cl2/toluene solutions with a N2 carrier gas. Herein we report the bulk resistivity, \u03c1, of AZO (0.252 \u03a9 cm) and GZO (0.756 \u03a9 cm) films deposited from this novel approach. All the films transparency exceeded 80% in the visible, X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed all films to crystallise in the wurtzite phase whilst X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the presence of the Al and Ga dopants in the films, and highlighted the low C-contamination (<5%) this route offers. Investigation of a mechanism analogous to the Kirkendall effect confirmed that heating of GZO films at 1000 \u00b0C produced the spinel structure GaZn2O4.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AACVD", "Al doping", "Ga doping", "Thin films", "Zinc oxide"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034820816", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"24923462200": {"Name": "Knapp C.", "AuthorID": "24923462200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56740071400": {"Name": "Dyer C.", "AuthorID": "56740071400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56524305000": {"Name": "Chadwick N.", "AuthorID": "56524305000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57194529998": {"Name": "Hazael R.", "AuthorID": "57194529998", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Defence Engineering, Cranfield Defence and Security, Cranfield University"}}}
