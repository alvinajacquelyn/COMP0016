Design/methodology/approach: The authors use longitudinal data from Britain, in which they can observe multiple generations of immigrants and their demographic and economic information. Findings: The probability models for housing tenure reveal significant variation in the outcomes which are robust to several econometric specifications. Research limitations/implications: As migration and its impact on local economy is a highly debated topic across several major regions of the world, the findings bring out important insights with policy implications. The research is limited by the sample size of the longitudinal survey. Originality/value: The empirical evidence on the topic is quite limited with mixed findings. Especially, the authors\u2019 ability to look through multiple generations is unique in identifying the variation in housing outcomes for the native and non-native citizens.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Demography", "Housing", "Lifecycle", "Migration", "Public policy", "Tenure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061735507", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"57206481311": {"Name": "Oladiran O.", "AuthorID": "57206481311", "AffiliationID": "60105822, 60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Real Estate and Planning, University of Reading Henley Business School"}, "23490117200": {"Name": "Nanda A.", "AuthorID": "23490117200", "AffiliationID": "60105822, 60012197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Real Estate and Planning, University of Reading Henley Business School"}, "55655427100": {"Name": "Milcheva S.", "AuthorID": "55655427100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
