Nerve regeneration following injury is dependent on Schwann cells, the supporting cells in the peripheral nervous system. Following nerve injury, Schwann cells adopt a proregenerative phenotype, which supports and guides regenerating nerves. However, this phenotype may not persist long enough to ensure functional recovery. Tissue-engineered nerve repair devices containing therapeutic cells that maintain the appropriate phenotype may help enhance nerve regeneration. The combination of gene and cell therapy is an emerging experimental strategy that seeks to provide the optimal environment for axonal regeneration and reestablishment of functional circuits. This review aims to summarize current preclinical evidence with potential for future translation from bench to bedside.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gene therapy", "peripheral nerve regeneration", "tissue engineering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cellular Microenvironment", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Nerve Regeneration", "Peripheral Nerves", "Stem Cell Transplantation", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011422075", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56568214300": {"Name": "Busuttil F.", "AuthorID": "56568214300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "14045774100": {"Name": "Rahim A.", "AuthorID": "14045774100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "9240949100": {"Name": "Phillips J.", "AuthorID": "9240949100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
