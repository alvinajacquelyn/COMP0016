Utilising marginal grafts, which are more susceptible to IR injury, makes this a key research goal. Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning (RIPC) has been shown to ameliorate hepatic IR injury in experimental models. Whether RIPC can reduce IR injury in human liver transplant recipients is unknown. Methods Forty patients undergoing liver transplantation were randomized to RIPC or a sham. RIPC was induced through three 5 min cycles of alternate ischaemia and reperfusion of the left leg prior to surgery. Data on clinical outcomes was collected prospectively. Per-operative cytokine levels were measured. Results Fourty five of 51 patients approached (88%) were willing to enroll in the study. Five patients were excluded and 40 randomized, of which 20 underwent RIPC which was successfully completed in all patients. There were no complications following RIPC. Median day 3 AST levels were slightly higher in the RIPC group (221 IU vs 149 IU, p = 1.00). Conclusions RIPC is acceptable and safe in liver transplant recipients. This study has not demonstrated evidence of a reduction in short-term measures of IR injury. Longer follow up will be required and consideration of an altered protocol.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aspartate Aminotransferases", "Biomarkers", "Cytokines", "Double-Blind Method", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Ischemic Preconditioning", "Leg", "Length of Stay", "Liver Transplantation", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pilot Projects", "Prospective Studies", "Regional Blood Flow", "Reperfusion Injury", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021244246", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"56730197200": {"Name": "Robertson F.P.", "AuthorID": "56730197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Intervention Science, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7102974662": {"Name": "Fuller B.J.", "AuthorID": "7102974662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Intervention Science, Royal Free Campus, University College London"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatico Pancreatico Biliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital Foundation Trust"}, "22634378000": {"Name": "Goswami R.", "AuthorID": "22634378000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatico Pancreatico Biliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital Foundation Trust"}, "55928327200": {"Name": "Imber C.", "AuthorID": "55928327200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatico Pancreatico Biliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital Foundation Trust"}, "57189238897": {"Name": "Sharma D.", "AuthorID": "57189238897", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatico Pancreatico Biliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital Foundation Trust"}, "55946935500": {"Name": "Malago M.", "AuthorID": "55946935500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatico Pancreatico Biliary Surgery and Liver Transplantation, Royal Free Hospital Foundation Trust"}, "57220808540": {"Name": "Wright G.P.", "AuthorID": "57220808540", "AffiliationID": "60018186", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunology, Edinburgh Napier University, Craiglockhart Campus"}}}
