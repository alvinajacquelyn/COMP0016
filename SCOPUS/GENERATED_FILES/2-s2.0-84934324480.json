We find that RI-CC2 and TD-DFT calculations using three different commonly employed XC-potentials (B3LYP, BHLYP and CAM-B3LYP) generally give consistent predictions. Most importantly, the fluorescence energy of m-phenylene is predicted to be independent of oligomer length, the fluorescence energy of p-phenylene to decrease with oligomer length and that of o-phenylene to increase. The origins of these differences in behaviour between the different isomers are analysed and found to stem from a subtle combination of steric and electronic factors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934324480", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55805566600": {"Name": "Guiglion P.", "AuthorID": "55805566600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507121537": {"Name": "Zwijnenburg M.", "AuthorID": "6507121537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
