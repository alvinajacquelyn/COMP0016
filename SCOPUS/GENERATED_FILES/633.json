All rights reserved.In recent years we have witnessed drastic transformations in the European geo-political and socio-economic map. Such changes not only pertained to the functional relations between regions, but at times also concerned the morphology of the network system in Europe. These structural developments have prompted various research questions on the relationships between spatial structure and spatial processes in a network economy. A rather common concept - often accepted in European policy decisions - is the notion of spatial hierarchy in networks, which implies a multi-layered configuration with major nodes at the top of the hierarchy. In this context, it is an intriguing research question to ask what these hierarchical concepts precisely mean and how they can be investigated in an operational sense. The aim of this paper is to shed some light on this issue. The starting point of our analysis will be the theory of hierarchical systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-12944327450", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"]], "AuthorData": {"6603380130": {"Name": "Medda F.", "AuthorID": "6603380130", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Free University, Faculty of Economics"}, "7102958684": {"Name": "Nijkamp P.", "AuthorID": "7102958684", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Free University, Faculty of Economics"}, "56261557300": {"Name": "Rietveld P.", "AuthorID": "56261557300", "AffiliationID": "60008734", "AffiliationName": "Free University, Dept. of Economics"}}}
