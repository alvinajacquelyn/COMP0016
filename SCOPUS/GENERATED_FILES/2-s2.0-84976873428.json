However, little is known about women\u2019s sensory experiences of colposcopy (other than pain) or what might impact on these experiences. The aim of this study was to explore women\u2019s sensory experiences of colposcopy and related procedures and identify factors which influenced negative sensory experiences. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 23 women who had undergone, for the first time, a colposcopy (some with related procedures, including punch biopsies and loop excision) as part of follow-up for abnormal cervical cytology. Interviews were analysed thematically using the Framework Approach to organise the data and identify emerging higher-order themes. Results: Women described a range of sensory experiences including pain or discomfort, cramping, stinging and cold sensations (due to the application of acetic acid to the cervix). Four key themes emerged as important aspects of the overall sensory experience: levels of pain, treatment-specific sensations, anaesthetic-specific sensations and solution-specific sensations. Factors that may influence women having a negative sensory experience were sensory expectations of the procedure(s) and lack of preparatory sensory information. Discussion: Our study provides unique in-depth insight into women\u2019s sensory experiences of colposcopy and related procedures and suggests women require more preparatory sensory information. The issues identified as contributing to women having a negative sensory experience may help inform the development of pre-colposcopy information which may better prepare women with abnormal cervical cytology for follow-up examinations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abnormal cervical cytology", "colposcopy", "preparatory information", "sensory experiences"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aftercare", "Colposcopy", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Pain, Procedural", "Patient Education as Topic", "Qualitative Research", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976873428", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57190050311": {"Name": "O\u2019Connor M.", "AuthorID": "57190050311", "AffiliationID": "60027144", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registry Ireland, Cork Airport Business Park"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "55438665900": {"Name": "Gallagher P.", "AuthorID": "55438665900", "AffiliationID": "60025059", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Human Sciences, Dublin City University"}, "8636346100": {"Name": "Martin C.M.", "AuthorID": "8636346100", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "57190044738": {"Name": "Jo\u2019Leary J.", "AuthorID": "57190044738", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "56803745100": {"Name": "D\u2019Arcy T.", "AuthorID": "56803745100", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "57219284888": {"Name": "Prendiville W.", "AuthorID": "57219284888", "AffiliationID": "60027572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital"}, "6603907450": {"Name": "Flannelly G.", "AuthorID": "6603907450", "AffiliationID": "60032976", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, National Maternity Hospital"}, "7006781007": {"Name": "Sharp L.", "AuthorID": "7006781007", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}}}
