Pain itself functions to promote recovery, and both the capacity to react to damaging stimuli and many behaviors showing the aversive nature of the event are widespread in animals. One of the behaviors, facial expression of pain, is described in detail, as it is a direct communication of pain to those close by, and is understood across ages, ethnicities, roles, and relationships. Those who observe another\u2019s pain may respond in various ways, from empathy to exploitation. Evolutionary mechanisms help us understand the biases in how we perceive and judge behavior that indicates pain, and how this informs social responses to pain, particularly in clinical and caregiving settings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Empathy", "Evolutionary psychology", "Facial expression", "Help-giving", "Social interaction"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063334564", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"23007289500": {"Name": "de C Williams A.", "AuthorID": "23007289500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6504714724": {"Name": "Kappesser J.", "AuthorID": "6504714724", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Psychology, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen"}}}
