The SCN9A gene encoding the sodium channel Nav1.7 expressed in the peripheral nervous system plays a critical role in IEM. A gain-of-function mutation in this sodium channel leads to aberrant sensory neuronal activity and extreme pain, particularly in response to heat. Five patients with IEM were treated with a new potent and selective compound that blocked the Nav1.7 sodium channel resulting in a decrease in heat-induced pain in most of the patients. We derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from four of five subjects and produced sensory neurons that emulated the clinical phenotype of hyperexcitability and aberrant responses to heat stimuli. When we compared the severity of the clinical phenotype with the hyperexcitability of the iPSC-derived sensory neurons, we saw a trend toward a correlation for individual mutations. The in vitro IEM phenotype was sensitive to Nav1.7 blockers, including the clinical test agent. Given the importance of peripherally expressed sodium channels in many pain conditions, our approach may have broader utility for a wide range of pain and sensory conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Erythromelalgia", "Female", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Male", "Mutation", "NAV1.7 Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel", "Pain", "Phenyl Ethers", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Sulfonamides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964484494", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"23007329400": {"Name": "Cao L.", "AuthorID": "23007329400", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "57188981645": {"Name": "McDonne A.", "AuthorID": "57188981645", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "57204777275": {"Name": "Nitzsche A.", "AuthorID": "57204777275", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "56592182000": {"Name": "Alexandrou A.", "AuthorID": "56592182000", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "6505817542": {"Name": "Saintot P.P.", "AuthorID": "6505817542", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "15058059100": {"Name": "Loucif A.J.C.", "AuthorID": "15058059100", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "7408342342": {"Name": "Brown A.R.", "AuthorID": "7408342342", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "15830706200": {"Name": "Young G.", "AuthorID": "15830706200", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "57205845904": {"Name": "Stanley P.", "AuthorID": "57205845904", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "56264735200": {"Name": "Kirby S.", "AuthorID": "56264735200", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "6508239724": {"Name": "Gutteridge A.", "AuthorID": "6508239724", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "16314756800": {"Name": "Butt R.", "AuthorID": "16314756800", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "7005885675": {"Name": "McKernan R.M.", "AuthorID": "7005885675", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "7202412883": {"Name": "Whiting P.", "AuthorID": "7202412883", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "57213472553": {"Name": "Ali Z.", "AuthorID": "57213472553", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "6603129087": {"Name": "Bilsland J.", "AuthorID": "6603129087", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "15770214900": {"Name": "Stevensl E.B.", "AuthorID": "15770214900", "AffiliationID": "60099418", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer Neuroscience and Pain Research Unit, Portway Building"}, "57188766657": {"Name": "Mis M.", "AuthorID": "57188766657", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, School of Physiology, Pharmacology, and Neuroscience"}, "57188986270": {"Name": "Randal A.", "AuthorID": "57188986270", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Hatherly College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "35434000500": {"Name": "Waxman S.G.", "AuthorID": "35434000500", "AffiliationID": "60105857", "AffiliationName": "Yale Center for Neuroscience and Regeneration Research, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Building 34"}, "14071020000": {"Name": "Tarabar S.", "AuthorID": "14071020000", "AffiliationID": "60006989", "AffiliationName": "Pfizer"}}}
