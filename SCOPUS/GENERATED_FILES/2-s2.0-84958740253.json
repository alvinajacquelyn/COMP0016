Methods: Thirty women (mean age 44 years, mean parity 2) with anal incontinence underwent 2D EAUS, anorectal pull-through manometry, anorectal electosensitivity and sensation to rectal distension, pelvic floor dynamometry, and completed Wexner incontinence scores. EAUS images were reported blind to physiological assessments by a single experienced observer. The external and internal sphincters, and puborectalis were measured and scored for integrity and atrophy, and correlated with symptom load (Wexner score) and physiological data. Results: The mean Wexner score was 10 (range 1-20). The puborectalis could not be accurately measured in 12 patients (44%) on EAUS. Anal squeeze pressure correlated with integrity of the external sphincter (r = -0.4, p = 0.02) but not integrity or atrophy of the puborectalis. There were no other significant correlations between EAUS features and patient symptom load or anorectal physiology (r range, -0.42-0.26, p > 0.05). Conclusion: Two-dimensional EAUS can define sphincter integrity, has a limited role for assessment of muscular quality but is not useful for assessment of the puborectalis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anal sphincter", "Anorectal physiology", "Endoanal ultrasound", "Fecal incontinence", "Perineal dynamometer", "Puborectalis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958740253", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"24484899200": {"Name": "Thiruppathy K.", "AuthorID": "24484899200", "AffiliationID": "60000077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "57220888566": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57220888566", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Physiology Unit, University College Hospital"}, "7401692748": {"Name": "Cohen R.", "AuthorID": "7401692748", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Physiology Unit, University College Hospital"}, "55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Physiology Unit, University College Hospital"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Physiology Unit, University College Hospital"}, "56721444300": {"Name": "Kuan K.G.", "AuthorID": "56721444300", "AffiliationID": "60000077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, The Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}}}
