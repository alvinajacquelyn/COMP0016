There is strong evidence from genetics and experimental models to support a central role for tau dysfunction in neuronal death, suggesting tau is a promising therapeutic target for AD and FTD. However, the development of tau pathology can precede symptom onset by several years, so understanding the earliest molecular events in tauopathy is a priority area of research. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from patients with genetic causes of tauopathy provide an opportunity to derive limitless numbers of human neurons with physiologically appropriate expression levels of mutated genes for in vitro studies into disease mechanisms. This review discusses the progress made to date using this approach and highlights some of the challenges and unanswered questions this technology has the potential to address.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Neurons", "tau Proteins", "Tauopathies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020275976", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"19934657400": {"Name": "Wray S.", "AuthorID": "19934657400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
