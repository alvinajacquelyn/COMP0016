The transitions between specific stages of the transcription cycle provide opportunities for the global and gene-specific regulation of gene expression. The exact mechanisms and the extent to which the different steps of transcription are exploited for regulation vary between the domains of life, individual species and transcription units. However, a surprising degree of conservation is apparent. Similar key steps in the transcription cycle can be targeted by homologous or unrelated factors providing insights into the mechanisms of RNAP and the evolution of the transcription machinery. Archaea are bona fide prokaryotes but employ a eukaryote-like transcription system to express the information of bacteria-like genomes. Thus, archaea provide the means not only to study transcription mechanisms of interesting model systems but also to test key concepts of regulation in this arena. In this review, we discuss key principles of archaeal transcription, new questions that still await experimental investigation, and how novel integrative approaches hold great promise to fill this gap in our knowledge.", "AuthorKeywords": ["archaea", "integrated systems biology", "regulation", "RNA polymerase", "transcription"], "IndexKeywords": ["Archaea", "DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases", "Gene Expression Regulation, Archaeal", "Transcription Factors", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068574130", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"23007827100": {"Name": "Blombach F.", "AuthorID": "23007827100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "55865613600": {"Name": "Matelska D.", "AuthorID": "55865613600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "55822011800": {"Name": "Fouqueau T.", "AuthorID": "55822011800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57209737135": {"Name": "Cackett G.", "AuthorID": "57209737135", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7102647041": {"Name": "Werner F.", "AuthorID": "7102647041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
