The LO-TO splittings, Born effective charges and phonon eigenvectors are calculated for them by density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). The dynamic charges of Al atoms are found to be close to their nominal valence charges (+3). Meanwhile, Si and most C atoms carry very different dynamic charges to their nominal ionic charges (+4 and \u22124). The static dielectric constants are found to be \u03b5xx\u00b0=\u03b5yy\u00b0=8.32 (6.31) and \u03b5zz\u00b0=9.80 (7.47) for Al4SiC4(Al4Si2C5). The mode-effective charge vectors and mode-dissociated static dielectric constants are also analyzed for each IR-active phonon mode. The infrared complex dielectric functions and reflectivity are computed in [010] and [001] directions for two structures, and they both show strong dependence on the polarization direction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aluminum silicon carbide", "Born effective charges", "Dielectric constants", "LO-TO splitting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aluminum silicon carbide", "Born effective charge", "Complex dielectric functions", "Density functional perturbation theory", "Hybrid density functional", "LO-TO splitting", "Polarization direction", "Static dielectric constants"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995757413", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"54385389700": {"Name": "Li Y.F.", "AuthorID": "54385389700", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "57188688392": {"Name": "Sun L.", "AuthorID": "57188688392", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "55442839500": {"Name": "Gao Y.M.", "AuthorID": "55442839500", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "55856717100": {"Name": "Xiao B.", "AuthorID": "55856717100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55549736400": {"Name": "Cheng Y.H.", "AuthorID": "55549736400", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electric Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}}}
