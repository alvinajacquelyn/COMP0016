Human NK cells that are primed with the CTV-1 leukemia cell line lysate CNDO-109 exhibit enhanced cytotoxicity against NK cell\u2013resistant cell lines. To translate this finding to the clinic, CNDO-109\u2013activated NK cells (CNDO-109-NK cells) isolated from related HLA-haploidentical donors were evaluated in a phase 1 dose-escalation trial at doses of 3 \u00d7 105 (n = 3), 1 \u00d7 106 (n = 3), and 3 \u00d7 106 (n = 6) cells/kg in patients with AML in first complete remission (CR1) at high risk for recurrence. Before CNDO-109-NK cell administration, patients were treated with lymphodepleting fludarabine/cyclophosphamide. CNDO-109-NK cells were well tolerated, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed at the highest tested dose. The median relapse-free survival (RFS) by dose level was 105 (3 \u00d7 105), 156 (1 \u00d7 106), and 337 (3 \u00d7 106) days. Two patients remained relapse-free in post-trial follow-up, with RFS durations exceeding 42.5 months. Donor NK cell microchimerism was detected on day 7 in 10 of 12 patients, with 3 patients having evidence of donor cells on day 14 or later. This trial establishes that CNDO-109-NK cells generated from related HLA haploidentical donors, cryopreserved, and then safely administered to AML patients with transient persistence without exogenous cytokine support. Three durable complete remissions of 32.6 to 47.6+ months were observed, suggesting additional clinical investigation of CNDO-109-NK cells for patients with myeloid malignancies, alone or in combination with additional immunotherapy strategies, is warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute myeloid leukemia", "CNDO-109\u2013activated natural killer cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cell Count", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Humans", "Immunotherapy, Adoptive", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Secondary Prevention", "Tissue Donors", "Transplantation, Haploidentical", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046167070", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"7004024926": {"Name": "Fehniger T.A.", "AuthorID": "7004024926", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "56810926700": {"Name": "Westervelt P.", "AuthorID": "56810926700", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7006336588": {"Name": "DiPersio J.F.", "AuthorID": "7006336588", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "7501593087": {"Name": "Miller J.S.", "AuthorID": "7501593087", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "9842642500": {"Name": "Cooley S.", "AuthorID": "9842642500", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "7005604046": {"Name": "Curtsinger J.", "AuthorID": "7005604046", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "7202662170": {"Name": "Stuart R.K.", "AuthorID": "7202662170", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina"}, "12767219000": {"Name": "Salhotra A.", "AuthorID": "12767219000", "AffiliationID": "60007474", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center"}, "57201821393": {"Name": "Hillman T.M.", "AuthorID": "57201821393", "AffiliationID": "118362206", "AffiliationName": "Fortress Biotech, Inc."}, "35364921000": {"Name": "Silver N.", "AuthorID": "35364921000", "AffiliationID": "118362206", "AffiliationName": "Fortress Biotech, Inc."}, "57205041001": {"Name": "Gorelik L.", "AuthorID": "57205041001", "AffiliationID": "118362206", "AffiliationName": "Fortress Biotech, Inc."}, "35405457700": {"Name": "Rowinsky E.", "AuthorID": "35405457700", "AffiliationID": "118362206", "AffiliationName": "Fortress Biotech, Inc."}, "6506022913": {"Name": "Szarek M.", "AuthorID": "6506022913", "AffiliationID": "60023247", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, SUNY Downstate School of Public Health"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}}}
