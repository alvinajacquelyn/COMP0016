They can greatly affect a patient\u2019s quality of life and present a substantial burden on healthcare. Although Electronic health records (EHRs) document a wealth of information relating to ADEs, they are frequently stored in the unstructured or semi-structured free-text narrative requiring Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to mine the relevant information. Here we present a rule-based ADE detection and classification pipeline built and tested on a large Psychiatric corpus comprising 264k patients using the de-identified EHRs of four UK-based psychiatric hospitals. The pipeline uses characteristics specific to Psychiatric EHRs to guide the annotation process, and distinguishes: a) the temporal value associated with the ADE mention (whether it is historical or present), b) the categorical value of the ADE (whether it is assertive, hypothetical, retrospective or a general discussion) and c) the implicit contextual value where the status of the ADE is deduced from surrounding indicators, rather than explicitly stated. We manually created the rulebase in collaboration with clinicians and pharmacists by studying ADE mentions in various types of clinical notes. We evaluated the open-source Adverse Drug Event annotation Pipeline (ADEPt) using 19 ADEs specific to antipsychotics and antidepressants medication. The ADEs chosen vary in severity, regularity and persistence. The average F-measure and accuracy achieved by our tool across all tested ADEs were 0.83 and 0.83 respectively. In addition to annotation power, the ADEPT pipeline presents an improvement to the state of the art context-discerning algorithm, ConText.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Antidepressive Agents", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Electronic Health Records", "Natural Language Processing", "ROC Curve", "Semantics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033454279", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56884540400": {"Name": "Iqbal E.", "AuthorID": "56884540400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57196475439": {"Name": "Rhodes D.", "AuthorID": "57196475439", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "34874014100": {"Name": "Wu H.", "AuthorID": "34874014100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "57195101070": {"Name": "Pandey C.", "AuthorID": "57195101070", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "8931612400": {"Name": "Dobson R.J.B.", "AuthorID": "8931612400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals"}, "57211618186": {"Name": "Ibrahim Z.M.", "AuthorID": "57211618186", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University College London Hospitals"}, "56884632200": {"Name": "Mallah R.", "AuthorID": "56884632200", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56884674200": {"Name": "Dzahini O.", "AuthorID": "56884674200", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57196475904": {"Name": "Romero A.", "AuthorID": "57196475904", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "SLaM BioResource for Mental Health, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London"}, "57196470770": {"Name": "Chang N.", "AuthorID": "57196470770", "AffiliationID": "60028884, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "SLaM BioResource for Mental Health, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, King\u2019s College London"}, "57197063791": {"Name": "Broadbent M.", "AuthorID": "57197063791", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Unit for Dementia, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation"}, "35594617600": {"Name": "Stewart R.", "AuthorID": "35594617600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Service and Population Research, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}}}
