Propulsion forces, trunk and upper limb kinematics and surface electromyography were recorded during four propulsion tasks (level, 2.5% cross slope, 6.5% incline and 12% incline). Kinetic and kinematic data were applied to an OpenSim musculoskeletal model of the trunk and upper limb, to enable calculation of glenohumeral joint contact force. Results demonstrated a positive correlation between propulsion forces and glenohumeral joint contact forces. Both propulsion forces and joint contact forces increased as the task became more challenging. Participants demonstrated increases in trunk flexion angle as the requirement for force application increased, significantly so in the 12% incline. There were significant increases in both resultant glenohumeral joint contact forces and peak and mean normalized muscle activity levels during the incline tasks. This study demonstrated the high demand placed on the glenohumeral joint during accessibility tasks, especially as the gradient of incline increases. A lightweight instrumented wheelchair wheel has potential to guide the user to minimize upper limb demand during daily activity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical Phenomena", "Biomedical Engineering", "Electromyography", "Humans", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Shoulder Joint", "Wheelchairs"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953250802", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"7101643482": {"Name": "Holloway C.S.", "AuthorID": "7101643482", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57038589700": {"Name": "Symonds A.", "AuthorID": "57038589700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14012223300": {"Name": "Suzuki T.", "AuthorID": "14012223300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "19640673800": {"Name": "Smitham P.", "AuthorID": "19640673800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55682655624": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "55682655624", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14044924300": {"Name": "Gall A.", "AuthorID": "14044924300", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
