PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of 57 male patients with CHM. Central foveal thickness (CFT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SCT), fundus autofluorescence area, and evidence of outer retinal and choroidal degeneration were analyzed by SD-OCT. RESULTS: Best-corrected VA logMAR at baseline was associated with CFT at baseline (r = -0.47; P < .01), CFT at most recent follow-up (r = -0.27; P < .01), and SCT at baseline (r = -0.31; P < .01). Ellipsoid zone (EZ) rupture was associated with a higher CFT loss (r = 0.33; P < .01) and macular cystic spaces (MCS) with a reduction in VA over time (hazard risk = 0.48; P = .05). CONCLUSION: Reduced CFT at baseline, EZ rupture, and MCS are poor prognostic indicators for VA outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Choroid", "Choroideremia", "Female", "Fovea Centralis", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Retina", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029685545", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"43961055700": {"Name": "Abbouda A.", "AuthorID": "43961055700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57195734427": {"Name": "Sprogyte L.", "AuthorID": "57195734427", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.R.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6506942455": {"Name": "Moosajee M.", "AuthorID": "6506942455", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57188689806": {"Name": "Lim W.S.", "AuthorID": "57188689806", "AffiliationID": "60030831", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Queen Mary Hospital"}}}
