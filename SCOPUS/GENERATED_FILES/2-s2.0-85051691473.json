All rights reserved.Although neurological manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are well recognised, myelopathy complicating SLE is rare. A 35-year-old woman presented with non-specific symptoms and a respiratory tract infection but had serological evidence of SLE. She subsequently deteriorated rapidly, developing a catastrophic spinal cord syndrome. Her initial MRI was normal; but after 1 month, her encephalopathy having progressed, repeat imaging showed characteristic myelitic changes. She responded only slowly to a combination of cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. This case exemplifies the mixed presentations of SLE, including the under-recognised 'subpial leukomyelopathy' of central nervous system lupus. It highlights the challenges in managing lupus-related myelopathy and the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach to care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Cortex Hormones", "Adult", "Complement C3", "Complement C4", "Female", "Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor", "Humans", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Spinal Cord", "Spinal Cord Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051691473", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57194425722": {"Name": "Raciborska D.D.", "AuthorID": "57194425722", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "24438206900": {"Name": "Noyce A.J.", "AuthorID": "24438206900", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal London Hospital"}, "7401858560": {"Name": "Turner B.P.", "AuthorID": "7401858560", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal London Hospital"}, "57217573518": {"Name": "Pyne D.", "AuthorID": "57217573518", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, Royal London Hospital"}}}
