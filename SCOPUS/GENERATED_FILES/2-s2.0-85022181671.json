After quality cuts, the stars with large radial action (JR > 800 km s-1 kpc) are extracted. A subset of these stars is clustered in longitude and velocity and can be selected with further cuts. The 14 stars are centred on (X, Y, Z) \u2248 (9.0, -1.0, -0.6) kpc and form a coherently moving structure in the halo with median (vR, v\u03c6, vz) = (167.33, 0.86, -94.85) km s-1. They are all metal-poor giants with median [Fe/H] = -0.83. To guard against the effects of distance errors, we compute spectrophotometric distances for 8 out of the 14 stars where this is possible. We find that six of the stars are still comoving. These six stars also have a much tighter [Fe/H] distribution \u223c-0.7 with one exception ([Fe/H]=-2.12).We conclude that the existence of the comoving cluster is stable against changes in distance estimation and conjecture that this is the dissolving remnant of a globular cluster accreted long ago.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: kinematics and dynamics", "Galaxies: structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022181671", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57194784096": {"Name": "Myeong G.", "AuthorID": "57194784096", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55566835100": {"Name": "Evans N.", "AuthorID": "55566835100", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "9533050200": {"Name": "Belokurov V.", "AuthorID": "9533050200", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}, "55916474900": {"Name": "Koposov S.", "AuthorID": "55916474900", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "57195339746": {"Name": "Sanders J.", "AuthorID": "57195339746", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge"}}}
