We examine the use of a Ne focused ion beam for producing nanowires integrated into superconducting circuits with a minimized density of parasitic two-level systems. We report measurements of nanowires produced by Ne focused-ion-beam milling in NbN resonators. The resonator losses increase after the nanowire is fabricated, with the $Q$ factor decreasing by \u223c30% to \u223c10 5, which is a factor 10-100 higher than in the most closely comparable circuits previously measured. This indicates that the Ne focused ion beam is a promising route for creating superconducting-nanowire-based devices with low levels of decoherence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dielectric loss", "ion beams", "Superconducting microwave device", "superconducting thin films"], "IndexKeywords": ["Focused ion beam milling", "Measurements of", "Quantum circuit", "Quantum system", "Superconducting circuit", "Superconducting microwave devices", "Superconducting nanowire", "Two-level system"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963799797", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57197459173": {"Name": "Burnett J.", "AuthorID": "57197459173", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "49461721200": {"Name": "Sagar J.", "AuthorID": "49461721200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7005264376": {"Name": "Warburton P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005264376", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "56213556200": {"Name": "Fenton J.C.", "AuthorID": "56213556200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}}}
