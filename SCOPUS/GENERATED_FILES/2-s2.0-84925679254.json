Here we capitalize on the greater availability of iconic lexical forms in a signed language (British Sign Language, BSL), to test how iconic relationships between meaning and form affect lexical processing. In three experiments, we found that iconicity in BSL facilitated picture-sign matching, phonological decision, and picture naming. In comprehension the effect of iconicity did not interact with other factors, but in production it was observed only for later-learned signs. These findings suggest that iconicity serves to activate conceptual features related to perception and action during lexical processing. We suggest that the same should be true for iconicity in spoken languages (e.g., onomatopoeias), and discuss the implications this has for general theories of lexical processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Embodiment", "Iconicity", "Language comprehension", "Language production", "Lexicon"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925679254", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"7005928441": {"Name": "Vinson D.", "AuthorID": "7005928441", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Multimodal Communication, University College London"}, "26533479100": {"Name": "Thompson R.L.", "AuthorID": "26533479100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "36857453400": {"Name": "Skinner R.", "AuthorID": "36857453400", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "The Centre for Translation and oInterpreting Studies in Scotland, Heriot-Watt University"}, "55919485500": {"Name": "Vigliocco G.", "AuthorID": "55919485500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Multimodal Communication, University College London"}}}
