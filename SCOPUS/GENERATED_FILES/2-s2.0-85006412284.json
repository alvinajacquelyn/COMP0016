Our method combines two key insights: (1) a visual 6 Degreeof-Freedom (DoF) pose estimation technique based on 2D-3D point correspondences is used to estimate the object pose in real-time and (2) the rigid transformation from the current to the nominal pose is computed online and the object is reoriented over a sequence of steps. The outcome of this work is a novel method that can be effectively used in the preparatory phase of a manipulation task, to permit a robot to start from arbitrary object placements and configure the manipulated objects to the nominal pose, as required for the execution of a subsequent task. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a full-size humanoid robot (WALK-MAN) using different objects with various pose settings under real-time constraints.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arbitrary objects", "Humanoid robot", "Manipulated objects", "Manipulation task", "Point correspondence", "Pose estimation", "Real time constraints", "Rigid transformations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006412284", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"35318566800": {"Name": "Nguyen A.", "AuthorID": "35318566800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "26023306800": {"Name": "Kanoulas D.", "AuthorID": "26023306800", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "7202685497": {"Name": "Caldwell D.", "AuthorID": "7202685497", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}, "56275172000": {"Name": "Tsagarakis N.", "AuthorID": "56275172000", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Robotics, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT)"}}}
