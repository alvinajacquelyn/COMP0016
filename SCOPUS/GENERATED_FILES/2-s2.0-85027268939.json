However, their causal role in learning remains to be established. In the present study, we first performed functional magnetic resonance imaging on healthy female and male human participants to confirm that MDC was most active in the initial stages of learning a novel vocabulary, consisting of pronounceable non words (pseudo words), each associated with a picture of a real object. We then examined, in healthy female and male human participants, whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation of a frontal midline node of the cingulo-opercular MDC affected learn in grates specifically during the in itial stages of learning.Wereportthatstimulationofthisnode,butnotacontrolbrainregion,substantially improved both accuracy and response times during the earliest stage of learning pseudo word\u2013object associations. This stimulation had no effect on the processing of established vocabulary, tested by the accuracy and response times when participants decided whether a real word was accurately paired with a picture of an object. These results provide evidence that noninvasive stimulation to MDC nodes can enhance learning rates, thereby demonstrating their causal role in the learning process. We propose that this causal role makes MDC candidate target for experimental therapeutics; for example, in stroke patients with aphasia attempting to reacquire a vocabulary.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex", "Functional magnetic resonance imaging", "Midline superior frontal gyrus", "Multiple-demand cortex", "Novel vocabulary learning", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Aged", "Association Learning", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Photic Stimulation", "Random Allocation", "Reaction Time", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Verbal Learning", "Vocabulary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027268939", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55376966600": {"Name": "Sliwinska M.", "AuthorID": "55376966600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "22956357800": {"Name": "Violante I.", "AuthorID": "22956357800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7402491215": {"Name": "Wise R.", "AuthorID": "7402491215", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "22941607300": {"Name": "Leech R.", "AuthorID": "22941607300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "9036383100": {"Name": "Geranmayeh F.", "AuthorID": "9036383100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "16444234600": {"Name": "Hampshire A.", "AuthorID": "16444234600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7102626575": {"Name": "Devlin J.", "AuthorID": "7102626575", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
