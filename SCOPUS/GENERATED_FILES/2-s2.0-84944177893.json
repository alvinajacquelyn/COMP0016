Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.Lewis acidic zeolites are rapidly emerging liquid-phase Lewis acid catalysts. Nevertheless, their inefficient synthesis procedure currently prohibits greater utilization and exploitation of these promising materials. Herein, we demonstrate that SnIV-containing zeolite beta can readily be prepared both selectively and extremely rapidly by solid-state incorporation (SSI) method. Through a combination of spectroscopic (XRD, UV/Vis, X-ray absorption, magic-angle spinning NMR, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy) studies, we unambiguously demonstrate that site-isolated, isomorphously substituted SnIV sites dominate the Sn population up to a loading of 5 wt % Sn. These sites are identical to those found in conventionally prepared Sn-beta, and result in our SSI material exhibiting identical levels of intrinsic activity (that is, turnover frequency) despite the threefold increase in Sn loading, and the extremely rapid and benign nature of our preparation methodology. We also identify the presence of spectator sites, in the form of SnIV oligomers, at higher levels of Sn loading. The consequences of this mixed population with regards to catalysis (Meerwein-Pondorf-Verley reaction and glucose isomerization) are also identified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomass", "heterogeneous catalysis", "Lewis acids", "tin", "zeolites"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopies", "Glucose isomerization", "Intrinsic activities", "Lewis Acid", "Lewis acid catalysis", "Lewis acid catalysts", "Magic angle spinning NMR", "Synthesis procedure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944177893", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"36521187700": {"Name": "Hammond C.", "AuthorID": "36521187700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University School of Chemistry"}, "56818853900": {"Name": "Padovan D.", "AuthorID": "56818853900", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University School of Chemistry"}, "56819002400": {"Name": "Al-Nayili A.", "AuthorID": "56819002400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University School of Chemistry"}, "6507384807": {"Name": "Dimitratos N.", "AuthorID": "6507384807", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, Cardiff University School of Chemistry"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8306766600": {"Name": "Gibson E.K.", "AuthorID": "8306766600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
