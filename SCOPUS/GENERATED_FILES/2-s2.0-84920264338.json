This older data provides a valuable archive, however, it is mainly stored on paper records that do not allow easy integration with other datasets. A method for converting these records to digital SEGY format has been reported previously, although the accuracy and reliability has not been documented. Using 3.5kHz pinger, bathymetric and side scan sonar data we test the accuracy and data resolution of converted paper seismic records on the surface and shallow-subsurface of the Barra Fan, NE Atlantic Ocean. Frequencies of navigational updates and printed fix marks are vital in determining positional accuracy as interpolation between fixes, which may be 30minutesapart, is a significant source of potential error. Vertical data resolution of the converted records is primarily governed by the dimensions of the printed record, with order of magnitude differences noted between the scanned BGS and NOC pinger records. Positional accuracy of pinger data is observed to be within the resolution of the bathymetric grid. BGS 1985 pinger data is located within 40m of bathymetric constrained locations at 635m below mean sea level and NOC 1998 pinger data within 25m of bathymetric locations at 1180m below mean sea level. This paper-to-digital conversion is not a replacement for modern data acquisition, but it does provide a valuable complement to such data. Where appropriate archival paper data is available for conversion it could be used to assist efficiency of forthcoming surveys and may be used to provide time series evidence of seabed processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Barra Fan", "Navigation accuracy", "Paper seismic record", "SEGY"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digital conversion", "Marine seismic reflections", "Navigation accuracy", "Positional accuracy", "Potential errors", "SEGY", "Seismic records", "Shallow subsurface"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920264338", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Economic Geology", "EART", "1905"], ["Stratigraphy", "EART", "1913"]], "AuthorData": {"36819898700": {"Name": "Owen M.", "AuthorID": "36819898700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7003590340": {"Name": "Maslin M.", "AuthorID": "7003590340", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "26643261900": {"Name": "Day S.", "AuthorID": "26643261900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7401957985": {"Name": "Long D.", "AuthorID": "7401957985", "AffiliationID": "60022706", "AffiliationName": "British Geological Survey"}}}
