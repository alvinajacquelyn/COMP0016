Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.In this article, we discuss the challenges faced in recruiting \u201chard-to-reach\u201d groups for interview studies, specifically those who do not access preventative healthcare services. We do this by reflecting on the varying success of different recruitment methods we have used in two recent studies; one investigating ethnic disparities in human papillomavirus vaccination uptake and another exploring difference in cervical screening non-participation. Engaging new community groups to help with recruitment proved particularly difficult, as did recruiting online. Our most successful recruitment methods included recruiting through community groups with whom we had previously established relationships, recruiting through schools and re-contacting participants who previously completed a related survey. We conclude that successful recruitment is dependent on study awareness and engagement. We urge others to be transparent in reporting recruitment methods in order to benefit the qualitative research community and suggest that details are published as supplementary material alongside qualitative articles in future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acceptability of healthcare", "interview", "prevention", "Qualitative research", "recruitment activities", "refusal to participate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Awareness", "Ethnic Groups", "Female", "Healthcare Disparities", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Organizations", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Papillomavirus Vaccines", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Patient Selection", "Preventive Health Services", "Qualitative Research", "Research", "Residence Characteristics", "Schools", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053251805", "SubjectAreas": [["Issues, Ethics and Legal Aspects", "NURS", "2910"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Fundamentals and Skills", "NURS", "2908"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"57190858490": {"Name": "Rockliffe L.", "AuthorID": "57190858490", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "57188823974": {"Name": "Chorley A.", "AuthorID": "57188823974", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "6508131110": {"Name": "Marlow L.", "AuthorID": "6508131110", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "16300728600": {"Name": "Forster A.", "AuthorID": "16300728600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}}}
