The present analysis evaluated whether the derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) could predict the effect of intermittent vs continuous chemotherapy on OS in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.Methods:A post hoc exploratory analysis of COIN arms A and C was performed. Landmark analysis was conducted on all patients with available WBC and neutrophils data. The dNLR was calculated using a formula which has previously demonstrated predictive power in cancer patients: dNLR=ANC/(WBC-ANC). A high dNLR was defined using a cut-off value of \u22652.22. Derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was then correlated with clinical outcomes. Survival curves were generated based on dNLR using the Kaplan-Meier method. Comparison between groups was performed using Cox regression.Results:A total of 1630 patients were assigned to the continuous (N=815) or intermittent (N=815) arms. There was a strong association between dNLR level and OS. The median survival times in the ITT population were 18.6 months and 12.5 months for patients with low and high dNLR, respectively (HR=1.70; 95% CI=1.52-1.90; P<0.001). The estimate of the hazard ratio did not alter substantially (HR=1.54) after adjusting for treatment, tumour status, number of metastatic sites, alkaline phosphate and platelet count.Conclusions:Derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio is strongly prognostic for survival in the COIN intermittent vs continuous treatment arms. Derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio does not predict for detrimental survival in patients treated with intermittent therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colorectal cancer", "intermittent therapy", "neutrophil lymphocyte ratio", "predictive", "prognostic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Cetuximab", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Humans", "Leukocyte Count", "Lymphocytes", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neutrophils", "Organoplatinum Compounds", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Pyrimidines", "Survival Rate", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958818605", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"6602781584": {"Name": "Grenader T.", "AuthorID": "6602781584", "AffiliationID": "60022846", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Institute, Shaare Zedek Medical Centre"}, "56844919000": {"Name": "Nash S.", "AuthorID": "56844919000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK, UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "25622953500": {"Name": "Adams R.", "AuthorID": "25622953500", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60016901", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, Velindre Hospital"}, "7403162716": {"Name": "Kaplan R.", "AuthorID": "7403162716", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "55604307900": {"Name": "Fisher D.", "AuthorID": "55604307900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, UCL"}, "7004025232": {"Name": "Maughan T.", "AuthorID": "7004025232", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "CRUK/MRC Oxford Institute for Radiation"}, "7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
