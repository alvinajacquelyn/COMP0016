We conducted a study with the iTalk2learn platform where students are undertaking fractions tasks of varying difficulty and assigned in one of two groups; one group used the iTalk2learn platform that included the affect-aware support, whereas in the other group the affect-aware support was switched off and support was provided based on students\u2019 performance only. We investigated the hypothesis that affect-aware support has a more pronounced effect when the cognitive demands of the tasks are higher. The results suggest that students that undertook the more challenging tasks were significantly more in-flow and less confused in the group where affect-aware support was provided than students who were supported based on their performance only.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive demands", "Learning tasks"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049360310", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55930232100": {"Name": "Grawemeyer B.", "AuthorID": "55930232100", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, Electronics and Maths, Coventry University"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56333317400": {"Name": "Mazziotti C.", "AuthorID": "56333317400", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Educational Research, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum"}, "57204347222": {"Name": "Rummel N.", "AuthorID": "57204347222", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Educational Research, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum"}, "22137095100": {"Name": "van Leeuwen A.", "AuthorID": "22137095100", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Social and Behavioral Science, Utrecht University"}}}
