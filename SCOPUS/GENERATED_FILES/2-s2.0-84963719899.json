Published by Oxford University Press.In this study, we examined how function and content words are read in intra- and interlingual subtitles. We monitored eye movements of a group of 39 deaf, 27 hard of hearing, and 56 hearing Polish participants while they viewed English and Polish videos with Polish subtitles. We found that function words and short content words received less visual attention than longer content words, which was reflected in shorter dwell time, lower number of fixations, shorter first fixation duration, and lower subject hit count. Deaf participants dwelled significantly longer on function words than other participants, which may be an indication of their difficulty in processing this type of words. The findings are discussed in the context of classical reading research and applied research on subtitling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Attention", "Case-Control Studies", "Eye Movements", "Female", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Poland", "Reading", "Time Factors", "Videotape Recording", "Vocabulary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963719899", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"54395481500": {"Name": "Krejtz I.", "AuthorID": "54395481500", "AffiliationID": "60031620", "AffiliationName": "SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities"}, "54416458200": {"Name": "Szarkowska A.", "AuthorID": "54416458200", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "University of Warsaw"}, "57188841449": {"Name": "\u0141ogi\u0144ska M.", "AuthorID": "57188841449", "AffiliationID": "60013756", "AffiliationName": "University of Warsaw"}}}
