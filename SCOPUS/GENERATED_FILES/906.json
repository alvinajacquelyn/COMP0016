This is a construction frequently used in the (colorful) Carath\u00e9odory and Tverberg theorems, and their relatives. We conjecture that when the family has at least d + 1 sets, where d is the dimension of the space, then the geometric join is contractible. We are able to prove this when d equals 2 and 3, while for larger d we show that the geometric join is contractible provided the number of sets is quadratic in d. We also consider a matroid generalization of geometric joins and provide similar bounds in this case.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colorful Carath\u00e9odory theorem", "Colorful point sets", "Nerve theorem"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925483776", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"7005223038": {"Name": "B\u00e1r\u00e1ny I.", "AuthorID": "7005223038", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6602353624": {"Name": "Holmsen A.F.", "AuthorID": "6602353624", "AffiliationID": "60032144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, KAIST"}, "55910027800": {"Name": "Karasev R.", "AuthorID": "55910027800", "AffiliationID": "60025404, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Information Transmission Problems RAS"}}}
