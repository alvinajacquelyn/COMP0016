Outlined in this paper is a step-by-step procedure for isolating aortic VSMCs from adult C57BL6J male mice by enzymatic digestion of the aorta using collagenase. The plating, culturing, and subculturing of the isolated cells are discussed in detail along with techniques to characterize VSMC phenotype by gene expression and immunofluorescence. Traction force microscopy was used to characterize contractility of single subcultured VSMCs at baseline.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aorta", "Caldesmon1", "Calponin 1", "Murine", "Smooth muscle 22\u03b1", "Smooth muscle myosin heavy chain", "Smooth muscle \u03b1-actin", "Smoothelin", "Subculture", "Vascular smooth muscle cell"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actins", "Animals", "Aorta", "Biomarkers", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Separation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cytoskeletal Proteins", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microfilament Proteins", "Muscle Proteins", "Muscle, Smooth, Vascular", "Myocytes, Smooth Muscle", "Phenotype", "Vasoconstriction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939995030", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"6701491446": {"Name": "Adhikari N.", "AuthorID": "6701491446", "AffiliationID": "60008772", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "55414080400": {"Name": "Shekar K.C.", "AuthorID": "55414080400", "AffiliationID": "60008772", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "24169919800": {"Name": "Staggs R.", "AuthorID": "24169919800", "AffiliationID": "60008772", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "34770122400": {"Name": "Hall J.L.", "AuthorID": "34770122400", "AffiliationID": "60008772", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota"}, "55876799800": {"Name": "Win Z.", "AuthorID": "55876799800", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Minnesota"}, "56050597700": {"Name": "Steucke K.", "AuthorID": "56050597700", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Minnesota"}, "8066360200": {"Name": "Alford P.", "AuthorID": "8066360200", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, University of Minnesota"}, "56303695900": {"Name": "Lin Y.W.", "AuthorID": "56303695900", "AffiliationID": "60008772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota"}, "7402950741": {"Name": "Wei L.N.", "AuthorID": "7402950741", "AffiliationID": "60008772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota"}}}
