Cross-sectional dog and fox serological sampling was conducted in seven rural sites from 2005 to 2006. Additionally, the relative abundance of each fox species was determined using a scent-station method. Overall, 249 dog-owning households were interviewed across the seven sites, and blood samples collected and analysed from a total of 267 domestic dogs and 33 wild foxes. CDV seroprevalences were similar in dogs (51 %) and foxes (42 %), whilst dogs had a higher CPV seroprevalence than foxes (77 and 49 %, respectively). Foxes were more abundant in the lowlands in areas where CDV prevalence was highest in domestic dogs. We hypothesise that cross-species transmission of CDV is likely to be occurring most frequently in lowland areas, and that wildlife in these areas may be at risk from spillover transmission from domestic dogs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Canine distemper", "Canine parvovirus", "Domestic dog", "Serosurvey", "Wild canids"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925443528", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"35274549900": {"Name": "Acosta-Jamett G.", "AuthorID": "35274549900", "AffiliationID": "60026158, 60021301, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "The Roslin Institute at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "60009498, 60005453", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6602328515": {"Name": "Bronsvoort B.M.d.C.", "AuthorID": "6602328515", "AffiliationID": "60026158, 60021301, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "The Roslin Institute at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"}, "57191181727": {"Name": "Cleaveland S.", "AuthorID": "57191181727", "AffiliationID": "60001574, 60001490", "AffiliationName": "Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health, Institute of Biodiversity, Animal Health and Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow"}}}
