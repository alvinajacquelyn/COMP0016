All rights reserved.Cerebrovascular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), is associated with MRI findings of lobar hemorrhage, cerebral microbleeds, and cortical superficial siderosis. Although pathological studies suggest that tau may co-localize with vascular amyloid, this has not yet been investigated in CAA in vivo. Three patients with probable CAA underwent 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) PET or 18F-florbetaben PET to evaluate amyloid burden, and 18F-AV-1451 PET to evaluate paired helical filament tau burden. Regions that had cerebral microbleeds or cortical superficial siderosis largely overlapped with those showing increased 18F-AV-1451. Our preliminary study raised the possibility that lobar cerebral microbleeds, and cortical superficial siderosis, which are characteristic markers of vascular amyloid, may be associated with local production of paired helical filament tau.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18F-AV-1451 PET", "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy", "cortical superficial siderosis", "lobar cerebral microbleeds", "tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aniline Compounds", "Brain", "Carbolines", "Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Thiazoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017530177", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57185160200": {"Name": "Kim H.J.", "AuthorID": "57185160200", "AffiliationID": "60020857", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Center, Samsung Medical Center"}, "57109751300": {"Name": "Jang Y.K.", "AuthorID": "57109751300", "AffiliationID": "60020857", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Center, Samsung Medical Center"}, "56195365900": {"Name": "Kim Y.J.", "AuthorID": "56195365900", "AffiliationID": "60006034", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Chuncheon Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine"}, "57109702500": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "57109702500", "AffiliationID": "60022417", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Chungnam National University Hospital"}, "57193926857": {"Name": "Jun S.", "AuthorID": "57193926857", "AffiliationID": "60020857", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Center, Samsung Medical Center"}, "57188928791": {"Name": "Park S.", "AuthorID": "57188928791", "AffiliationID": "60020857", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Center, Samsung Medical Center"}, "7103210298": {"Name": "Na D.L.", "AuthorID": "7103210298", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences and Technology, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University"}, "16305669100": {"Name": "Seo S.W.", "AuthorID": "16305669100", "AffiliationID": "60007511", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research Design and Evaluation, SAIHST, Sungkyunkwan University"}, "55196047200": {"Name": "Cho H.", "AuthorID": "55196047200", "AffiliationID": "60095571, 60016728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine"}, "6505826405": {"Name": "Lyoo C.H.", "AuthorID": "6505826405", "AffiliationID": "60095571, 60016728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57215648932": {"Name": "Lee J.S.", "AuthorID": "57215648932", "AffiliationID": "60025071", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Kyung Hee University Hospital"}, "7103412060": {"Name": "Ryu Y.H.", "AuthorID": "7103412060", "AffiliationID": "60095571, 60016728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine"}, "57138980800": {"Name": "Choi J.Y.", "AuthorID": "57138980800", "AffiliationID": "60095571, 60016728", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Gangnam Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine"}, "57207830205": {"Name": "Cho Y.S.", "AuthorID": "57207830205", "AffiliationID": "60016329, 60020857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine"}, "55577774100": {"Name": "Moon S.H.", "AuthorID": "55577774100", "AffiliationID": "60016329, 60020857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine"}}}
