All rights reserved.Background Leadership skills directly correlate with the quality of technical performance of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and clinical outcomes. Despite an improved focus on non-technical skills in CPR training, the leadership of cardiac arrests is often variable. Aims To assess the perceptions of leadership and team working among members of a cardiac arrest team and to evaluate future training needs. Methods Cross-sectional survey of 102 members of a cardiac arrest team at an Acute Hospital Trust in the UK with 892 inpatient beds. Responses sought from doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants to 12 rated statements and 4 dichotomous questions. Results Of 102 responses, 81 (79%) were from doctors and 21 (21%) from nurses. Among specialist registrars 90% agreed or strongly agreed that there was clear leadership at all arrests compared with between 28% and 49% of nurses and junior doctors respectively. Routine omission of key leadership tasks was reported by as many as 80% of junior doctors and 50% of nurses. Almost half of respondents reported non-adherence with Advanced Life Support (ALS) guidelines. Among junior members of the team, 36% felt confident to lead an arrest and 75% would welcome further dedicated cardiac arrest leadership training. Conclusions Leadership training is integrated into the ALS (Resus Council, UK) qualification. However, this paper found that in spite of this training; standards of leadership are variable. The findings suggest a pressing need for further dedicated cardiac arrest leadership training with a focus on improving key leadership tasks such as role assignment, team briefing and debriefing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Advanced Cardiac Life Support", "Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Guideline Adherence", "Heart Arrest", "Hospital Rapid Response Team", "Humans", "Leadership", "Nurses", "Physicians", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973563103", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57189629813": {"Name": "Robinson P.S.", "AuthorID": "57189629813", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189629357": {"Name": "Shall E.", "AuthorID": "57189629357", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603035925": {"Name": "Rakhit R.", "AuthorID": "6603035925", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
