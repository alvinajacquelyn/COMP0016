Several target and scattering models are considered. The calculations were performed using (1) the UKRMol suite which relies on the use of Gaussian type orbitals (GTOs) to represent the continuum and (2) using the new UKRMol+ suite which allows the inclusion of B-spline type orbitals in the basis for the continuum. The final close-coupling scattering models used the UKRMol+ code and a frozen core, valence full configuration interaction, method based on a diffuse GTO atomic basis set. The calculated electronic properties of the molecule are in very good agreement with state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations. The use of the UKRMol+ suite proved critical since it allowed the use of a large R-matrix sphere (35 Bohr), necessary to contain the diffuse electronic states of the molecule. The corresponding calculations using UKRMol are not possible due to numerical problems associated with the combination of GTO-only continuum and a large R-matrix sphere. This work provides the first demonstration of the utility and numerical stability of the new UKRMol+ code. The inelastic cross sections obtained here present a significant improvement over the results of earlier studies on BeH.", "AuthorKeywords": ["B-splines", "BeH", "electronic excitation", "fusion", "R-matrix"], "IndexKeywords": ["B splines", "Close-coupling scattering", "Electronic excitation", "Electronic structure calculations", "Full configuration interaction", "Gaussian-type orbitals", "Inelastic cross sections", "R matrices"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028423890", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57194267646": {"Name": "Darby-Lewis D.", "AuthorID": "57194267646", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "53880108900": {"Name": "Ma\u0161\u00edn Z.", "AuthorID": "53880108900", "AffiliationID": "60030732", "AffiliationName": "Max-Born-Institut"}}}
