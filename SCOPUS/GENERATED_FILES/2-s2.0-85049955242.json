In response to cellular stress, FUS is recruited to cytoplasmic stress granules, which are hypothesized to act as precursors of pathological inclusions. We monitored the stress-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of endogenous FUS in an ex vivo mouse CNS model and human neural networks. We found that hyperosmolar, but not oxidative, stress induced robust cytoplasmic translocation of neuronal FUS, with transient nuclear clearance and loss of function. Surprisingly, this reaction is independent of stress granule formation and the molecular pathways activated by hyperosmolarity. Instead, it represents a mechanism mediated by cytoplasmic redistribution of Transportin 1/2 and is potentiated by transcriptional inhibition. Importantly, astrocytes, which remain unaffected in ALS/FTD-FUS, are spared from this stress reaction that may signify the initial event in the development of FUS pathology.Hock et al. show that hypertonic stress leads to cytoplasmic translocation and loss of function of neuronal FUS in a stress granule-independent manner. Stress-induced FUS translocation results from impaired Transportin-mediated nuclear import. Astrocytes are resistant to cytoplasmic FUS mislocalization upon hypertonic pressure and lack pathological protein accumulations in FTD-FUS brains.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ALS", "FTD", "FUS", "nucleocytoplasmic shuttling", "protein aggregation", "RNA-binding proteins", "stress granules", "Transportin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Astrocytes", "Cell Nucleus", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cytoplasm", "HEK293 Cells", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Karyopherins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons", "RNA-Binding Protein FUS", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049955242", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57190565166": {"Name": "Hock E.M.", "AuthorID": "57190565166", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60025858, 60006811", "AffiliationName": "Life Science Zurich Graduate School, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich"}, "55839085700": {"Name": "Maniecka Z.", "AuthorID": "55839085700", "AffiliationID": "60012614, 60025858, 60006811", "AffiliationName": "Life Science Zurich Graduate School, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich"}, "55279745200": {"Name": "Hruska-Plochan M.", "AuthorID": "55279745200", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich"}, "55921533400": {"Name": "Laferri\u00e8re F.", "AuthorID": "55921533400", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Zurich"}, "56157422000": {"Name": "Sahadevan M.K.
