The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We study the global star formation law - the relation between gas and star formation (SF) rates - in a sample of 181 local galaxies with infrared (IR) luminosities spanning almost five orders of magnitude (107.8 - 1012.3 L\u2299), which includes 115 normal spiral galaxies and 66 (ultra)luminous IR galaxies ((U)LIRGs, LIR \u2265 1011 L\u2299). We derive their atomic, molecular gas, and dense molecular gas masses using newly available HI, CO, and HCN data from the literature, and SF rates are determined both from total IR (8-1000 \u03bcm) and 1.4 GHz radio continuum (RC) luminosities. In order to derive the disk-averaged surface densities of gas and SF rates, we have taken a novel approach and used high-resolution RC observations to measure the radio sizes for all 181 galaxies. In our sample, we find that the surface density of dense molecular gas (as traced by HCN) has the tightest correlation with that of SF rates (\u03a3SFR), and is linear in log-log space (power-law slope of N = 1.01 \u00b1 0.02) across the full galaxy sample. The correlation between surface densities of molecular gas (\u03a3H2, traced by CO) and \u03a3SFR is sensitive to the adopted value of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (\u03b1CO) used to infer molecular gas masses from CO luminosities. For a fixed Galactic value of \u03b1CO, a power law index of 1.14 \u00b1 0.02 is found. If instead we adopt values for \u03b1CO of 4.6 and 0.8 for disk galaxies and (U)LIRGs, respectively, we find the two galaxy populations separate into two distinct \u03a3SFR versus \u03a3H2 relations. Finally, applying a continuously varying \u03b1CO to our sample, we recover a single \u03a3SFR-\u03a3H2 relation with slope of 1.60 \u00b1 0.03. The \u03a3SFR is a steeper function of total gas \u03a3gas (molecular gas with atomic gas) than that of molecular gas \u03a3H2, and are tighter among low-luminosity galaxies. We find no correlation between global surface densities of SFRs and atomic gas (HI).", "AuthorKeywords": ["galaxies: evolution", "galaxies: ISM", "galaxies: spiral", "galaxies: starburst", "stars: formation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930010524", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56567014400": {"Name": "Liu L.", "AuthorID": "56567014400", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55547120397": {"Name": "Gao Y.", "AuthorID": "55547120397", "AffiliationID": "60007171", "AffiliationName": "Purple Mountain Observatory, Key Lab of Radio Astronomy"}, "10339159000": {"Name": "Greve T.", "AuthorID": "10339159000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
