Methods: Eighteen GPs participating in a feasibility randomised controlled trial were interviewed. Interviews were semi-structured and audio-recorded. Data were analysed using a Framework Approach. Results: Participants perceived eliciting ACs as important for: reducing the need for multiple visits, identifying serious illness early, and increasing patient and GP satisfaction. GPs found the prompts easy to use and some continued their use after the study had ended to aid time management. Others noted similarities between the intervention and their usual practice. Nevertheless, soliciting ACs in every consultation was not unanimously supported. Conclusion: The prompts were acceptable to GPs within a trial context, but there was disagreement as to whether ACs should be solicited routinely. Some GPs considered the intervention to aid their prioritisation efficiency within consultations. Practice implications: Some GPs will find prompts which encourage ACs to be solicited early in the consultation enable them to better organise priorities and manage time-limited consultations more effectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Communication", "Framework approach", "Patient concerns", "Primary care", "Qualitative", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Communication", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "General Practice", "General Practitioners", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Primary Health Care", "Qualitative Research", "Referral and Consultation", "Tape Recording", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953776318", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56579005200": {"Name": "Summers R.", "AuthorID": "56579005200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "6603019104": {"Name": "Brindle L.", "AuthorID": "6603019104", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "15023021300": {"Name": "Moore M.", "AuthorID": "15023021300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7201984993": {"Name": "Little P.", "AuthorID": "7201984993", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "6602558835": {"Name": "Leydon G.", "AuthorID": "6602558835", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "54950491600": {"Name": "Ekberg S.", "AuthorID": "54950491600", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Biomedical Innovation, Queensland University of Technology"}, "6701468194": {"Name": "Chew-Graham C.", "AuthorID": "6701468194", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute, Primary Care and Health Sciences, NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC) West Midlands, Research Institute, Keele University"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
