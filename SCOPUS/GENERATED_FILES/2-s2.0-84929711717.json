Using objectification model of eating pathology as a theoretical framework, the authors examined the potential intervening roles of body shame, appearance anxiety, and dietary restraint in the pathway between body checking and binge eating. Data collected from a large sample of treatment-seeking people with Bulimic-type Eating Disorders (N= 801) were analysed trough structural equation modelling. Results showed that, regardless of specific DSM-5 diagnostic categories, body checking behaviours were indirectly associated with binge eating and dietary restraint through body shame and appearance anxiety, whereas dietary restraint was directly linked to binge eating. The findings have clinical utility as they contribute to gaining insight into how critical scrutiny of one's body may act in several indirect ways to affect binge eating. We discuss practical implications of the findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binge eating", "Body image", "Bulimic-type disorders", "DSM-5", "Ex post facto study"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929711717", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"55366742000": {"Name": "Dakanalis A.", "AuthorID": "55366742000", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "University of Pavia"}, "56470353500": {"Name": "Zanetti A.", "AuthorID": "56470353500", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "University of Pavia"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London"}, "21233554200": {"Name": "Timko A.", "AuthorID": "21233554200", "AffiliationID": "60030118", "AffiliationName": "Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"}, "54895234300": {"Name": "Volpato C.", "AuthorID": "54895234300", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "University of Milano-Bicocca"}, "56472836400": {"Name": "Pla-Sanjuanelo J.", "AuthorID": "56472836400", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Barcelona"}, "56962750600": {"Name": "Riva G.", "AuthorID": "56962750600", "AffiliationID": "60024053, 60006646", "AffiliationName": "Catholic University of Milan and Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}}}
