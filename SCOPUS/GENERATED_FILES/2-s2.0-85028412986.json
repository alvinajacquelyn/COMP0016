Journal of Applied Research in Intellectual Disabilities Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: An increasing number of genetic causes of intellectual disabilities (ID) are identifiable by clinical genetic testing, offering the prospect of bespoke patient management. However, little is known about the practices of psychiatrists and their views on genetic testing. Method: We undertook an online survey of 215 psychiatrists, who were contacted via the Royal College of Psychiatrist's Child and Adolescent and Intellectual Disability Psychiatry mailing lists. Results: In comparison with child and adolescent psychiatrists, intellectual disability psychiatrists ordered more genetic tests, referred more patients to genetic services, and were overall more confident in the genetic testing process. Respondents tended to agree that genetic diagnoses can help patient management; however, management changes were infrequently found in clinical practice. Conclusions: Differences are apparent in the existing views and practices of child and adolescent and intellectual disability psychiatrists. Developing training and collaboration with colleagues working in genetic services could help to reduce discrepancies and improve clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical management", "copy number variant", "diagnosis", "learning disability", "service provision"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Child", "Genetic Testing", "Health Care Surveys", "Humans", "Intellectual Disability", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Psychiatry", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028412986", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57027303600": {"Name": "Wolfe K.", "AuthorID": "57027303600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56708604800": {"Name": "Stueber K.", "AuthorID": "56708604800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57200009218": {"Name": "McQuillin A.", "AuthorID": "57200009218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57198123299": {"Name": "Bass N.", "AuthorID": "57198123299", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "54782782200": {"Name": "Jichi F.", "AuthorID": "54782782200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Group, Joint Research Office, University College London"}, "8560282000": {"Name": "Patch C.", "AuthorID": "8560282000", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35974506900": {"Name": "Flinter F.", "AuthorID": "35974506900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy's and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
