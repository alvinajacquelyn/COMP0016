Publication rights licensed to ACM.This article presents the findings of a web survey designed to better understand the expectations and use of digital editions of texts. The survey, modelled upon a detailed analysis of 242 projects, recorded 218 complete responses, shedding light on user requirements of digital editions. Specifically, the survey indicates that issues of data reuse, licensing, image availability, and comprehensive documentation are the most requested features of digital editions, although ones which seldom are provided. This analysis feeds into previous studies on good practice in building Digital Humanities resources and puts forward practical recommendations for both creators and funders of digital editions in an effort to promote a stronger consideration of user needs. This survey will be of interest to those who produce digital editions of texts, including developers and engineers, and will also be of interest to those who commission and fund these projects, such as universities, libraries, and archives, whose documentary collections are often showcased in digital editions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Digital edition", "Digital humanities", "Evaluation", "Survey", "Text", "User studies"], "IndexKeywords": ["Digital edition", "Digital humanities", "Evaluation", "Text", "User study"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062245136", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"56184554000": {"Name": "Franzini G.", "AuthorID": "56184554000", "AffiliationID": "60024053", "AffiliationName": "CIRCSE, Universit\u00e0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore"}, "23568761100": {"Name": "Terras M.", "AuthorID": "23568761100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Edinburgh"}, "56166904700": {"Name": "Mahony S.", "AuthorID": "56166904700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
