However, the impact of aging on the innate inflammatory response to pneumococci is poorly defined. We compared the innate immune response in old vs. young adult mice following infection with S. pneumoniae. The accumulation of neutrophils recovered from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung homogenates was increased in aged compared with young adult mice, although bacterial outgrowth was similar in both age groups, as were markers of microvascular leak. Aged mice had similar levels of IL-1\u03b2, TNF, IFN-\u0263, IL-17, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor following S. pneumoniae infection, compared with young mice, but increased levels of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL12, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, and CCL17. Moreover, levels of IL-10 were significantly lower in aged animals. Neutralization of IL-10 in infected young mice was associated with increased neutrophil recruitment but no decrease in bacterial outgrowth. Furthermore, IL-10 neutralization resulted in increased levels of CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10. We conclude that aging is associated with enhanced inflammatory responses following S. pneumoniae infection as a result of a compromised immunomodulatory cytokine response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Chemokine", "Inflammation", "Neutrophil", "Pneumonia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Chemokines", "Female", "Immunomodulation", "Interleukin-10", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Neutrophil Infiltration", "Neutrophils", "Pneumonia, Pneumococcal", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937720120", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"23567318700": {"Name": "Williams A.E.", "AuthorID": "23567318700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "56304528100": {"Name": "Jos\u00e9 R.J.", "AuthorID": "56304528100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "35553480100": {"Name": "Brown J.S.", "AuthorID": "35553480100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "35478426700": {"Name": "Chambers R.C.", "AuthorID": "35478426700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Inflammation and Tissue Repair, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}}}
