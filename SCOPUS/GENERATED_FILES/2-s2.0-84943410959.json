Magnetic resonance imaging has increased the number of candidates by determining focal structural brain abnormalities not previously apparent. Advances in other techniques have widened the spectrum of surgical candidates both in adults and children. In the short term, rates of seizure freedom are relatively high, but seizure recurrence can still occur in the long term. There are methodological hurdles to overcome when assessing longer-term outcome. There are also the outcomes beyond seizures-cognition, neurodevelopment, academic and vocational outcomes, and quality of life-which are of importance when determining whether a treatment is benefi cial. The aim of this volume is to focus on longer-term outcomes from epilepsy surgery in both adults and children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adults", "Children", "Epilepsy surgery", "Long term", "Outcomes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943410959", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"7003767721": {"Name": "Malmgren K.", "AuthorID": "7003767721", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7004038207": {"Name": "Baxendale S.", "AuthorID": "7004038207", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Clinical Neuroscience, UCL-Institute of Child Health"}}}
