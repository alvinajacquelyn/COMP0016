Methods A mixed methods design comprising a survey and four focus groups was adopted. Focus group discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim and explored using thematic framework analysis. Results A total of 185 Hindu women completed surveys and 23 attended focus groups. Of the respondents 75% aged 25-64 years reported having cervical screening within the last 5 years; 85% had attended college or university. Familiar barriers to attendance for screening were identified: fear of pain and the test result, embarrassment, screener's attitude, inconvenient appointment times and difficulty with child care. Additional barriers cited included age and country of birth, with older and Indian-born women thought to be less likely to attend for screening. Self-collected sampling had a mixed reception. Women were not confident that their sample would be as good as a clinician sample and expressed concern about the impact that a positive HPV result might have on their relationships. Conclusions Screening attendance in this highly educated group of Hindu women was slightly lower than in the general population (75% of women aged 25-64 years had been screened in the last 5 years compared with 79% in England as a whole). Familiar barriers to screening were identified. Women felt able to collect their own sample for HPV testing with a Dacron swab but lacked confidence that it would be as good as that obtained by a clinician.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Hinduism", "Humans", "London", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Papillomavirus Infections", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Self Care", "Specimen Handling", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918829995", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"6602106811": {"Name": "Cadman L.", "AuthorID": "6602106811", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Prevention, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35329102200": {"Name": "Ashdown-Barr L.", "AuthorID": "35329102200", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Research Nurse, Centre for Cancer Prevention, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57191898211": {"Name": "Waller J.", "AuthorID": "57191898211", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "57188713896": {"Name": "Szarewski A.", "AuthorID": "57188713896", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cancer Prevention, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
