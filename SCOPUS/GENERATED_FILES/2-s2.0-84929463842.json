A viral infection was diagnosed. Two days later, she re-presented with a swollen right eyelid and a moderately red eye. Oral amoxicillin and chloramphenicol eye drops were prescribed. The next day, marked periorbital swelling developed. She was admitted to hospital and parenteral ceftriaxone was started. Examination under anaesthetic showed injected globe diffuse corneal clouding and peripheral corneal opacities; ultrasound and CT suggested endophthalmitis. On transfer to a tertiary centre, intraocular vancomycin and subconjunctival cefuroxime were given. Aqueous fluid samples were positive for group A Streptococcus (GAS) by PCR, so parenteral clindamycin was added. GAS endophthalmitis was confirmed 1 day later from the positive intraocular fluid culture results. Visual evoked potentials revealed complete loss of vision. The eye was removed to limit potential spread. She made a good recovery postoperatively and was discharged on oral antibiotics.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Child, Preschool", "Clindamycin", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Endophthalmitis", "Female", "Humans", "Orbital Cellulitis", "Pharyngitis", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Streptococcal Infections", "Streptococcus pyogenes", "Treatment Outcome", "Vancomycin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929463842", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55750371200": {"Name": "Fitzgerald F.", "AuthorID": "55750371200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity, Inflammation and Physiological Medicine, UCL, Institute of Child Health, London"}, "56234893300": {"Name": "Harris K.", "AuthorID": "56234893300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Virology and Infection Control, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56647438600": {"Name": "Henderson R.", "AuthorID": "56647438600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57207652117": {"Name": "Edelsten C.", "AuthorID": "57207652117", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
