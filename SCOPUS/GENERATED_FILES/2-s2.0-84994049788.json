This observation could, however, be generated by reverse causality. That is, weight loss in the incipient phase of dementia ascribed to diminished self-care, including sub-optimal nutrition, would have the effect of generating such an inverse association. One approach to circumventing this problem would be to measure weight in a population which is young enough to be free of the symptoms of dementia which is then followed up for dementia occurrence over many decades. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, body mass index, and other potential risk factors, were measured in 9547 male university undergraduates (mean age 20.5 years) in 1948-68 who were then linked to national mortality registers. Results: Of 2537 deaths over a mean of 50.6 years follow up, 140 were ascribed to dementia. There was no association between overweight and future dementia deaths (age-adjusted hazard ratio; 95 % confidence interval: 0.93; 0.49, 1.79). Conclusion: In this cohort study of former university students, being overweight in youth did not confer protection against later dementia death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cohort", "Dementia", "Epidemiology", "Life course", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cohort Studies", "Dementia", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Scotland", "Universities", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994049788", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre, University of Edinburgh"}, "7101906583": {"Name": "Starr J.", "AuthorID": "7101906583", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre, University of Edinburgh"}, "36667256000": {"Name": "Russ T.", "AuthorID": "36667256000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University of Edinburgh"}, "6701354952": {"Name": "Galobardes B.", "AuthorID": "6701354952", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "8582488800": {"Name": "Jeffreys M.", "AuthorID": "8582488800", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "35354080500": {"Name": "Davey Smith G.", "AuthorID": "35354080500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}}}
