All rights reserved.We show the formation of vesicles from amphiphilic block-oligopeptoids, named here peptoidosomes. The peptoids, synthetic analogues to peptides, were synthesised from solid phase synthesis. Their hydrophilic to hydrophobic aspect ratio was designed to favour the formation of vesicles. MALDI-TOF analysis confirmed their formation. Using a range of hydrophilic parts, we analysed their influence on the quality of the actual peptoids generated but also how different hydrophilic part influence vesicle formation. We found peptoids to be quite resistant to swelling but were able to form peptoidosomes for all peptoids investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abbreviations DCC dicyclohexylcarbodiimide", "DIC diisopropylcar-bodiimide", "DLS Dynamic Light Scattering", "LSCM Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy", "MALDI-TOF matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation-time of flight", "NMR Nuclear Magnetic Resonance", "TEM Transmission Electron Microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amphiphilics", "DIC diisopropylcar-bodiimide", "Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide", "Laser scanning confocal microscopy", "Matrix assisted laser desorption", "Solid phase synthesis", "Synthetic analogues", "Vesicle formation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946553848", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"26221693700": {"Name": "Gaitzsch J.", "AuthorID": "26221693700", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Basel"}, "36947932100": {"Name": "Karu K.", "AuthorID": "36947932100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57204254218": {"Name": "Battaglia G.", "AuthorID": "57204254218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
