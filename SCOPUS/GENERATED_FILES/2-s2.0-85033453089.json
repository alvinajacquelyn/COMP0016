In concentrated suspensions, we are trying to reproduce the shear thickening phenomenon seen in, for example, cornstarch. We investigate the effect of different frictional contact models. When contact acts to impose a fixed minimum separation between particles, there is a strict upper bound to the viscosity predicted by simulations. We deduce that soft or compressible contacts are a critical component of the strong shear thickening seen in experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Concentrated suspension", "Critical component", "Frictional contact model", "Frictional shear", "Non-brownian", "Shear thickening", "Steady shear flow", "Upper Bound"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033453089", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mechanics", "ENGI", "2206"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57014522000": {"Name": "Townsend A.", "AuthorID": "57014522000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35104042400": {"Name": "Wilson H.", "AuthorID": "35104042400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
