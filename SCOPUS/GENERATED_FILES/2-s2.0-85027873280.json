We demonstrate through genetic fate mapping and intersectional focal septal deletion that NKX2-1 is selectively required in the embryonic septal neuroepithelium for the development of cholinergic septohippocampal projection neurons and large subsets of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. In the absence of NKX2-1, these neurons fail to develop, causing alterations in hippocampal theta rhythms and severe deficiencies in learning and memory. Our results demonstrate that learning and memory are dependent on NKX2-1 function in the embryonic septum and suggest that cognitive deficiencies that are sometimes associated with pathogenic mutations in NKX2-1 in humans may be a direct consequence of loss of NKX2-1 function.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acetylcholine", "development", "hippocampus", "septum", "theta"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcholine", "Animals", "Cholinergic Neurons", "Cognition", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Maze Learning", "Memory", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Rotarod Performance Test", "Septum of Brain", "Stereotaxic Techniques", "Theta Rhythm", "Thyroid Nuclear Factor 1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027873280", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"35091479800": {"Name": "Magno L.", "AuthorID": "35091479800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "8069944100": {"Name": "Schmidt-Hieber C.", "AuthorID": "8069944100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57195403467": {"Name": "Theodotou P.", "AuthorID": "57195403467", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "7003425281": {"Name": "H\u00e4usser M.", "AuthorID": "7003425281", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "10139263300": {"Name": "Kessaris N.", "AuthorID": "10139263300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "13405610800": {"Name": "Barry C.", "AuthorID": "13405610800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
