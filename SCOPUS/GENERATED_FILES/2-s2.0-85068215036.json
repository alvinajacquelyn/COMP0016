{"Title": "TIME to think about delirium: Improving detection and management on the acute medical unit", "Year": 2018, "Source": "BMJ Open Qual.", "Volume": "7", "Issue": 3, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 11, "DOI": "10.1136/bmjoq-2017-000200", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068215036&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.Delirium affects 18%\u201335% patients in the acute hospital setting, yet is often neither detected nor managed appropriately. It is associated with increased risk of falls, longer hospital stay and increased morbidity and mortality rates. It is a frightening and unpleasant experience for both patients and their families. We used quality improvement tools and a multicomponent intervention to promote detection and improve management of delirium on the acute medical unit (AMU). We reviewed whether a delirium screening tool (4AT) had been completed for all patients aged over 65 years admitted to the AMU over 1 week. If delirium was detected, we assessed whether investigation and management was adequate as per national guidance. After baseline data collection, we delivered focused sessions of delirium education for doctors and nursing staff, including training on use of the 4AT tool and the TIME (Triggers, Investigate, Manage, Engage) management bundle. We introduced TIME checklists, an online delirium order set and created a bedside orientation tool. We collected data following the interventions and identified areas for further improvement. Following our first PDSA (Plan, Do, Study, Act) cycle, use of the 4AT screening tool improved from 40% to 61%. Adequate assessment for the causes of and exacerbating factors for delirium increased from 73% to 94% of cases. Use of personal orientation tools improved from 0% to 38%. In summary, a targeted staff education programme and practical aids for the ward have improved the screening and management of delirium on the AMU. This may be improved further through more frequent training sessions to account for regular changeover of junior doctors and through implementing a nursing champion for delirium.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068215036", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Leadership and Management", "NURS", "2911"]], "AuthorData": {"57203361350": {"Name": "Bauernfreund Y.", "AuthorID": "57203361350", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex Hospital"}, "57218332070": {"Name": "Butler M.", "AuthorID": "57218332070", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex Hospital"}, "57218332698": {"Name": "Ragavan S.", "AuthorID": "57218332698", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Care of the Elderly Department, North Middlesex Hospital"}, "7005604974": {"Name": "Sampson E.L.", "AuthorID": "7005604974", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health Liaison Service, North Middlesex Hospital"}}}
