This paper aims to study doping effects of Dy3+ and Y3+ on the thermodynamic properties of ZrO2 synthesized via a sol-gel route for a better control of the stoichiometry, combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for the calculation of theoretical properties. The thermal conductivity is investigated by the MD simulation and Clarke's model. This can improve the understanding of the microstructure and thermodynamic properties of (DyY)Zr2O7 (DYZ) at the atomistic level. The phonon-defect scattering and phonon-phonon scattering processes are investigated via the theoretical calculation, which provides an effective way to study thermal transport properties of ionic oxides. The measured and predicted thermal conductivity of DYZ is lower than that of 4 mol % Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (4YSZ). It is discovered that DYZ is thermochemically compatible with Al2O3 at 1300 \u00b0C, whereas at 1350 \u00b0C DYZ reacts with Al2O3 forming a small amount of new phases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959010381", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56113475800": {"Name": "Qu L.", "AuthorID": "56113475800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University XCollege London"}, "57203183054": {"Name": "Choy K.L.", "AuthorID": "57203183054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University XCollege London"}, "7006060490": {"Name": "Wheatley R.", "AuthorID": "7006060490", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Nottingham"}}}
