In the highly eusocial insects, great degrees of variation in lifespan exist between morphological castes in relation to extreme divisions of labour, but of particular interest are the primitively eusocial insects. These species represent the ancestral beginnings of eusociality, in which castes are flexible and based on behaviour rather than morphology. Here we present data on the longevity of the primitively eusocial Neotropical paper wasp P. canadensis, in a captive setting removed of environmental hazards. Captive Polistes canadensis had an average lifespan of 193 \u00b1 10.5 days; although this average is shorter than most bee and ant queens, one individual lived for 506 days in the lab-longer than most recorded wasps and bees. Natal colony variation in longevity does exist between P. canadensis colonies, possibly due to nutritional and genetic factors. This study provides a foundation for future investigations on the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on longevity in primitively eusocial insects, as well as the relationship with natal group and cohort size.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Caste", "Eusocial", "Hymenoptera", "Laboratory", "Lifespan"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926442599", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56584629700": {"Name": "Southon R.", "AuthorID": "56584629700", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "56583480600": {"Name": "Bell E.", "AuthorID": "56583480600", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "55201839500": {"Name": "Graystock P.", "AuthorID": "55201839500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "7005759495": {"Name": "Sumner S.", "AuthorID": "7005759495", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol"}}}
