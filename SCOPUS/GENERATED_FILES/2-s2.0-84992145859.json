All rights reserved.3D models can be used in 3D printing and many other areas. At present, there are a lot of researches on 3D model retrieval and sketch is considered to be important for 3D model retrieval. In this paper, we develop a new 3D model retrieval prototype system based on style-sensitive 3D model retrieval method and three-view user sketches. We also implement user-friendly graphic interfaces for the 3D model retrieval system. We explore the performance of the system by conducting a series of 3D model retrieval experiments on the Princeton shape benchmark data set. Experimental results show that the new retrieval system can obtain satisfactory retrieval results. And some results of the new method are superior to some content-based 3D model retrieval methods, in terms of both quantitative search performance metrics and qualitatively measured user search experiences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D model", "retrieval", "user interface", "views"], "IndexKeywords": ["3 d model retrievals", "3-d modeling", "3D model retrieval methods", "Content-based 3D model retrieval", "Graphic interfaces", "retrieval", "Search performance", "views"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992145859", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57217575895": {"Name": "Cao B.", "AuthorID": "57217575895", "AffiliationID": "116119396", "AffiliationName": "Hebei Province Key Laboratory of Big Data Calculation"}, "57072169000": {"Name": "Kang Y.", "AuthorID": "57072169000", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "National Engineering Research Center of Digital Life, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "14035859100": {"Name": "Lin S.", "AuthorID": "14035859100", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Communication and Design, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "8293331200": {"Name": "Luo X.", "AuthorID": "8293331200", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "National Engineering Research Center of Digital Life, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "7404439278": {"Name": "Xu S.", "AuthorID": "7404439278", "AffiliationID": "60022904", "AffiliationName": "Information Systems Department, New Jersey Institute of Technology"}, "55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "SIAT, Chinese Academy of Science"}, "56501123700": {"Name": "Xue Y.", "AuthorID": "56501123700", "AffiliationID": "60064143", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer and Software, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology"}}}
