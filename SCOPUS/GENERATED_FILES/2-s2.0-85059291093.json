In Africa, policies on sustained CPT during antiretroviral therapy (ART) differ between countries. We assessed the safety of discontinuing CPT in stable patients on ART in Uganda. Methods COSTOP was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Patients aged 18 years, on CPT, and stable on ART (CD4 counts 250 cells/\u03bcL); were randomised to daily oral placebo (PLC group) or cotrimoxazole 960 mg/tablet (CTX group). Co-primary outcomes were: (i) time to first cotrimoxazole-preventable infection, with non- inferiority of PLC defined as the upper one-sided 95% confidence limit of the adjusted hazard ratio(aHR) 1.25; and (ii) time to first grade 3/4 haematological adverse event. Findings 2180 subjects (1091 PLC; 1089 CTX) were enrolled. 932 PLC and 943 CTX completed the trial after 12 months minimum follow up. Ninety-eight participants (59 PLC; 39 CTX) experienced 120 cotrimoxazole- preventable events, mainly bacterial pneumonia (72 events, 4 deaths PLC); (48 events, 2 deaths CTX). The aHR for time to first event was 1.57 (upper one-sided 95% confidence limit 2.21) in per protocol population (similar results in ITT population). 551 participants (318 CTX; 233 PLC) experienced 1043 haematological adverse events (616 CTX; 427 PLC). Time to the first adverse event, mainly neutropenia, was shorter in the CTX group (aHR 0.70 95%CI 0.59\u20130.82; log-rank \u03c72 = 18.08; P<0.0001). 362 (276 PLC, 86 CTX) participants experienced at least one episode of confirmed clinical malaria (P<0.0001). Interpretation In ART stable patients with CD4 counts 250 cells/\u03bcL, continued CPT significantly reduces risk of severe bacterial infections and protects against malaria, while discontinuing CPT reduces haematological adverse events.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Opportunistic Infections", "Placebos", "Safety", "Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination", "Uganda", "Withholding Treatment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059291093", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55799491900": {"Name": "Anywaine Z.", "AuthorID": "55799491900", "AffiliationID": "60071671, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Uganda Virus Research Institute, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit"}, "55195293900": {"Name": "Kasirye R.", "AuthorID": "55195293900", "AffiliationID": "60071671, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Uganda Virus Research Institute, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit"}, "36990168800": {"Name": "Lutaakome J.K.", "AuthorID": "36990168800", "AffiliationID": "60071671, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Uganda Virus Research Institute, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit"}, "25930307600": {"Name": "Abaasa A.", "AuthorID": "25930307600", "AffiliationID": "60071671, 60031331", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Uganda Virus Research Institute, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Uganda Research Unit"}, "57191037895": {"Name": "Munderi P.", "AuthorID": "57191037895", "AffiliationID": "60138713", "AffiliationName": "International Association of Providers of AIDS Care"}, "7403284470": {"Name": "Levin J.", "AuthorID": "7403284470", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, University of Witwatersrand"}, "7102771386": {"Name": "Nunn A.", "AuthorID": "7102771386", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London"}, "16236343900": {"Name": "Grosskurth H.", "AuthorID": "16236343900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
