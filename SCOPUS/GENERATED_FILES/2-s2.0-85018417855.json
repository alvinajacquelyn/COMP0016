Given the high volume of available data, these systems benefit from an automatic feature selection process. This is accomplished either by applying statistical learning techniques, which do not consider the semantic relationship between the selected features and the inference task, or by developing labour-intensive text classifiers. In this paper, we use neural word embeddings, trained on social media content from Twitter, to determine, in an unsupervised manner, how strongly textual features are semantically linked to an underlying health concept. We then refine conventional feature selection methods by a priori operating on textual variables that are sufficiently close to a target concept. Our experiments focus on the supervised learning problem of estimating influenza-like illness rates from Google search queries. A \u201cflu infection\u201d concept is formulated and used to reduce spurious \u2014and potentially confounding\u2014 features that were selected by previously applied approaches. In this way, we also address forms of scep-ticism regarding the appropriateness of the feature space, alleviating potential cases of overfitting. Ultimately, the proposed hybrid feature selection method creates a more reliable model that, according to our empirical analysis, improves the inference performance (Mean Absolute Error) of linear and nonlinear regressors by 12% and 28.7%, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational health", "Feature selection", "Gaussian processes", "Influenza-like illness", "Regularised regression", "Search query logs", "Syndromic surveillance", "User-generated content", "Word embeddings"], "IndexKeywords": ["Embeddings", "Gaussian Processes", "Influenza-like illness", "Regularised regression", "Search queries", "Syndromic surveillance", "User-generated content"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018417855", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"36610455100": {"Name": "Lampos V.", "AuthorID": "36610455100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57188726237": {"Name": "Zou B.", "AuthorID": "57188726237", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7101864930": {"Name": "Cox I.J.", "AuthorID": "7101864930", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen"}}}
