Published by Oxford University Press.Neonates treated for acute respiratory failure experience episodes of hypoxia. The hippocampus, a structure essential for memory, is particularly vulnerable to such insults. Hence, some neonates undergoing treatment for acute respiratory failure might sustain bilateral hippocampal pathology early in life and memory problems later in childhood. We investigated this possibility in a cohort of 40 children who had been treated neonatally for acute respiratory failure but were free of overt neurological impairment. The cohort had mean hippocampal volumes (HVs) significantly below normal control values, memory scores significantly below the standard population means, and memory quotients significantly below those predicted by their full scale IQs. Brain white matter volume also fell below the volume of the controls, but brain gray matter volumes and scores on nonmnemonic neuropsychological tests were within the normal range. Stepwise linear regression models revealed that the cohort's HVs were predictive of degree of memory impairment, and gestational age at treatment was predictive of HVs: the younger the age, the greater the atrophy. We conclude that many neonates treated for acute respiratory failure sustain significant hippocampal atrophy as a result of the associated hypoxia and, consequently, show deficient memory later in life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["developmental amnesia", "hippocampal volumes", "hypoxia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Atrophy", "Checklist", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Demography", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Intelligence Tests", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory Disorders", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Pretectal Region", "Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult", "Statistics as Topic", "Verbal Learning"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930318186", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57203556574": {"Name": "Cooper J.M.", "AuthorID": "57203556574", "AffiliationID": "60009102", "AffiliationName": "Murdoch Childrens Research Institute"}, "14626220800": {"Name": "Jentschke S.", "AuthorID": "14626220800", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Freie Universit\u00e4t"}, "8944994900": {"Name": "Munoz M.", "AuthorID": "8944994900", "AffiliationID": "60000823", "AffiliationName": "University of Castilla-La Mancha"}, "56667228100": {"Name": "Pitts G.", "AuthorID": "56667228100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7003274699": {"Name": "Baldeweg T.", "AuthorID": "7003274699", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004346948": {"Name": "De Haan M.", "AuthorID": "7004346948", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004489148": {"Name": "Vargha-Khadem F.", "AuthorID": "7004489148", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7006246597": {"Name": "Gadian D.G.", "AuthorID": "7006246597", "AffiliationID": "115297696", "AffiliationName": "Imaging and Biophysics Unit"}, "45961050200": {"Name": "Banks T.", "AuthorID": "45961050200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology"}, "57203031127": {"Name": "Chong W.K.", "AuthorID": "57203031127", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology"}, "55586512600": {"Name": "Goldman A.", "AuthorID": "55586512600", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Intensive Care"}, "6507851178": {"Name": "Hoskote A.", "AuthorID": "6507851178", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Intensive Care"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, London"}, "7007041182": {"Name": "Mishkin M.", "AuthorID": "7007041182", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neuropsychology, National Institute of Mental Health"}}}
