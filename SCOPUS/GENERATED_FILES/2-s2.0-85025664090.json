We evolve an understanding of this kind of everyday media multitasking behaviour through an analysis of video data. In our study, four households were recorded watching television over three evenings. We analysed 55 hours of footage in which participants were watching the TV. We found that mobile device habits were highly variable between participants during this time, ranging from 0% to 23% of the time that the TV was on. To help us understand this variability, participants completed the Media Multitasking Index (MMI) questionnaire. Results showed that participants with a higher MMI score used their mobile device more while watching TV at home. We also saw evidence that the TV was being used as a hub in the home: multiple people were often present when the time the TV was on, providing a background for other household activities. We argue that video analysis can give valuable insights into media multitasking in the home.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dual screen", "In the wild", "Media multitasking", "Mobile", "Multitasking", "Task switching", "Television", "Video observation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dual screen", "Household activities", "Mobile", "Multiple people", "Task switching", "Video analysis", "Video data", "Video observation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025664090", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57191501022": {"Name": "Rigby J.", "AuthorID": "57191501022", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "22833443900": {"Name": "Brumby D.", "AuthorID": "22833443900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "55258058900": {"Name": "Gould S.", "AuthorID": "55258058900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham"}}}
