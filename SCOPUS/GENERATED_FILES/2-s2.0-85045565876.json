However, they are currently underutilised due to cost and performance issues, many of which are linked to the microstructure of the porous carbon electrodes used. Here, for the first time, we offer a detailed study of the in situ effects of compression on a commercially available carbon felt electrode. Visualisation of electrode structure using X-ray computed tomography shows the non-linear way that these materials compress and various metrics are used to elucidate the changes in porosity, pore size distribution and tortuosity factor under compressions from 0%\u201390%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon felt", "Compression", "Redox flow battery", "RFB", "X-ray computed tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon felt electrodes", "Carbon felts", "Electrode structure", "In-situ compression", "Performance issues", "Porous carbon electrodes", "Renewable energy generation", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045565876", "SubjectAreas": [["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Energy (miscellaneous)", "ENER", "2101"], ["Electrochemistry", "CHEM", "1603"]], "AuthorData": {"56110123700": {"Name": "Jervis R.", "AuthorID": "56110123700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54962772600": {"Name": "Neville T.P.", "AuthorID": "54962772600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202240331": {"Name": "Meyer Q.", "AuthorID": "57202240331", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57199236850": {"Name": "Brown L.D.", "AuthorID": "57199236850", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56901064000": {"Name": "Iacoviello F.", "AuthorID": "56901064000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56389335800": {"Name": "Kok M.D.R.", "AuthorID": "56389335800", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, McGill University"}, "6507302334": {"Name": "Gostick J.T.", "AuthorID": "6507302334", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Porous Media Engineering and Analysis Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo"}}}
