Their histopathological and molecular characteristics vary considerably as do their management and prognosis. Conventional gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the primary imaging modality for initial work up and follow up of patients with gliomas, although it has some limitations, especially in differentiating high from low grade tumours and in distinguishing disease recurrence from post-therapy changes. Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI is a relatively novel tool that combines MRI sequences with metabolic information from PET, and therefore different PET radiotracers, in a single scan. This article discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of combined PET/MRI compared to other conventional or more widely available imaging tools, such as MRI or combined positron emission tomography\u2013computed tomography. The main uses of PET/MRI and the most commonly used PET radiotracers in providing diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information in patients with glioma are covered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Neoplasms", "Glioma", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Multimodal Imaging", "Neoplasm Staging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Radiopharmaceuticals"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068646382", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57209775322": {"Name": "Almansory K.O.", "AuthorID": "57209775322", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals"}, "36905492400": {"Name": "Fraioli F.", "AuthorID": "36905492400", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospitals"}}}
