Most research has demonstrated learning of the trained task or even learning transfer to a closely related task. However, few studies have reported \"far-transfer\" to a different domain, such as the improvement of phonological and reading skills following auditory or cognitive training. This study assessed the effectiveness of auditory, memory or attention training on far-transfer measures involving phonological and reading skills in typically developing children. Midtransfer was also assessed through untrained auditory, attention and memory tasks. Sixty 5-to 8-year-old children with normal hearing were quasi-randomly assigned to one of five training groups: attention group (AG), memory group (MG), auditory sensory group (SG), placebo group (PG; drawing, painting), and a control, untrained group (CG). Compliance, mid-transfer and far-transfer measures were evaluated before and after training. All trained groups received 12 \u00d7 45-min training sessions over 12 weeks. The CG did not receive any intervention. All trained groups, especially older children, exhibited significant learning of the trained task. On pre-to post-training measures (test-retest), most groups exhibited improvements on most tasks. There was significant mid-transfer for a visual digit span task, with highest span in the MG, relative to other groups. These results show that both sensory and cognitive (memory or attention) training can lead to learning in the trained task and to mid-transfer learning on a task (visual digit span) within the same domain as the trained tasks. However, learning did not transfer to measures of language (reading and phonological awareness), as the PG and CG improved as much as the other trained groups. Further research is required to investigate the effects of various stimuli and lengths of training on the generalization of sensory and cognitive learning to literacy skills.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Auditory Perception", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child Development", "Cognition", "Female", "Generalization (Psychology)", "Humans", "Literacy", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942872523", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"22956179200": {"Name": "Murphy C.", "AuthorID": "22956179200", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Therapy, Speech-Language Pathology and Occupational Therapy, School of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "6602370646": {"Name": "Schochat E.", "AuthorID": "6602370646", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Therapy, Speech-Language Pathology and Occupational Therapy, School of Medicine, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "35580993300": {"Name": "Moore D.", "AuthorID": "35580993300", "AffiliationID": "60017412, 60030440", "AffiliationName": "Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Department of Otolaryngology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine"}, "14522185400": {"Name": "Dick F.", "AuthorID": "14522185400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck College"}}}
