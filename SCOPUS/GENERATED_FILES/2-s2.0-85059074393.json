Both commands can impose the constraint that the resulting estimated function is monotone. Using such a shape restriction may significantly improve the performance of the NPIV estimator (Chetverikov and Wilhelm, 2017, Econometrica 85: 1303- 1320) because the ill-posedness of the NPIV estimation problem leads to unconstrained estimators that suffer from particularly poor statistical properties such as high variance. However, the constrained estimator that imposes the monotonicity significantly reduces variance by removing nonmonotone oscillations of the estimator. We provide a small Monte Carlo experiment to study the estimators\u2019 finite-sample properties and an application to the estimation of gasoline demand functions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endogeneity", "Monotonicity", "Nonparametric instrumental-variable estimation", "Npiv", "Npivcv", "Regression", "Shape restrictions", "St0547"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059074393", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"]], "AuthorData": {"55995253400": {"Name": "Chetverikov D.", "AuthorID": "55995253400", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of California, Los Angeles"}, "57221129705": {"Name": "Kim D.", "AuthorID": "57221129705", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "57194973025": {"Name": "Wilhelm D.", "AuthorID": "57194973025", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}}}
