For this purpose, a prototype steel building is designed using different seismic-resistant frames, i.e.: moment-resisting frames (MRFs); MRFs with viscous dampers; SC-MRFs; and SC-MRFs with viscous dampers. The frames are modeled in OpenSees where material and geometrical nonlinearities are taken into account as well as stiffness and strength deterioration. A database of 91 near-fault, pulse-like ground motions with varying pulse periods is used to conduct incremental dynamic analysis (IDA), in which each ground motion is scaled until collapse occurs. The probability of collapse and the probability of exceeding different residual story drift threshold values are calculated as a function of the ground motion intensity and the period of the velocity pulse. The results of IDA are then combined with probabilistic seismic hazard analysis models that account for near-fault directivity to assess and compare the collapse risk and the residual drift performance of the frames. The paper highlights the benefit of combining the post-tensioning and supplemental viscous damping technologies in the near-source. In particular, the SC-MRF with viscous dampers is found to achieve significant reductions in collapse risk and probability of exceedance of residual story drift threshold values compared to the MRF.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collapse", "Dampers", "Near-fault", "Post-tensioned", "Residual drifts", "Seismic hazard analysis", "Seismic risk", "Self-centering", "Steel frames"], "IndexKeywords": ["Collapse", "Dampers", "Near fault", "Post tensioned", "Residual drifts", "Seismic hazard analysis", "Seismic risk", "Self centering", "Steel frame"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961213474", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"]], "AuthorData": {"55832365800": {"Name": "Tzimas A.", "AuthorID": "55832365800", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "35784432400": {"Name": "Kamaris G.", "AuthorID": "35784432400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "9237958700": {"Name": "Karavasilis T.", "AuthorID": "9237958700", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "26537243900": {"Name": "Galasso C.", "AuthorID": "26537243900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London (UCL)"}}}
