It is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder, for which 10 causative genes have been identified so far. The USH genes encode a number of structurally and functionally distinct proteins that form complexes in the inner ear and retina essential for hearing and vision. Animal studies have indicated that the hearing loss associated with USH mainly results from abnormal development of the hair bundle, the mechanoreceptive organelle of the sensory hair cells. In contrast, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the USH visual impairment remain unclear. Although a cure for USH is not yet available, a host of promising therapeutic studies have made progress toward developing an effective treatment for the retinal defects associated with USH. This review provides an outline of the genes and proteins underlying USH, their interactions and functions in the inner ear and retina, and the therapeutic strategies that are under investigation as potential treatments for this disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gene therapy", "hair cell", "hearing loss", "photoreceptor", "retinitis pigmentosa", "stereocilia", "Usher syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929721224", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Optometry", "HEAL", "3610"]], "AuthorData": {"55342894400": {"Name": "Toms M.", "AuthorID": "55342894400", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7202946936": {"Name": "Webster A.", "AuthorID": "7202946936", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London"}, "6506942455": {"Name": "Moosajee M.", "AuthorID": "6506942455", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London"}, "7003541560": {"Name": "Bitner-Glindzicz M.", "AuthorID": "7003541560", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, London"}}}
