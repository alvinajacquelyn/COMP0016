All rights reserved.The resonance of a floating tension leg platform (TLP) excited by the third-harmonic force of a regular wave is investigated based on fully nonlinear theory with a higher order boundary element method (BEM). The total wave elevation and the total velocity potential are separated into two parts, based on the incoming wave from infinity and the disturbed potential by the body. A numerical radiation condition is then applied at the far field to absorb the disturbed potential without affecting the incident potential. The BEM mesh on the free surface is generated only once at the initial time and the element nodes are rearranged subsequently without changing their connectivity by using a spring analysis method. Through some auxiliary functions, the mutual dependence of fluid/structure motions is decoupled, which allows the body acceleration to be obtained without the knowledge of the pressure distribution. Numerical simulation is carried out for the interaction of a floating TLP with waves. The focus is on the motion principally excited by higher harmonic wave forces. In particular, the resonance of the ISSC TLP generated by the third-order force at the triple wave frequency in regular waves is investigated, together with the tensions of the tendons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Floating body/wave interaction", "Fully nonlinear theory", "Higher order boundary element method", "Tension leg platform", "Third-harmonic resonance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Auxiliary functions", "Floating bodies", "Fully nonlinear", "Higher-order boundary element methods", "Radiation condition", "Tension leg platforms (TLP)", "Third harmonic", "Velocity potentials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921376413", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7401906874": {"Name": "Zhou B.", "AuthorID": "7401906874", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Ship Building Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
