Knowledge is often hard to be processed, handled, formalized, modeled. Yet cognitive models are useful to avoid the typical unmanageability of domains with high complexity such as the environmental one, and enhance knowledge organization and management. We have investigated on the potentials of cognitive-mapping-based tools, particularly on cross impact evaluations, in the case study of Taranto (Italy). The process was aimed at building up future development scenarios in city neighborhoods, and fuzzy cognitive mapping were used to support decision-making by exploring cross impacts of possible policy perspectives. Although substantial results are rather general, the study proves to be interesting in enhancing the potentials of FCM-based approach to support decisionmaking, particularly when dealing with well-focused policy perspectives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision support system", "Environmental planning", "Fuzzy cognitive mapping", "Multiple agents"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive mapping", "Development scenarios", "Environmental planning", "Fuzzy cognitive mappings", "Impact evaluation", "Knowledge building", "Knowledge organization", "Multiple agents"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951816164", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"8987448700": {"Name": "Borri D.", "AuthorID": "8987448700", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "DICATECh, Technical University of Bari"}, "13008459800": {"Name": "Camarda D.", "AuthorID": "13008459800", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "DICATECh, Technical University of Bari"}, "55872771600": {"Name": "Pluchinotta I.", "AuthorID": "55872771600", "AffiliationID": "60008924, 60105740", "AffiliationName": "LAMSADE-CNRS, Universite Paris-Dauphine"}, "57021136700": {"Name": "Esposito D.", "AuthorID": "57021136700", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "DICATECh, Technical University of Bari"}}}
