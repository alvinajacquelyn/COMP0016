As the therapy becomes more widely implemented within mental health services its longevity and uptake is likely to depend on its feasibility and acceptability to service users and clinicians. Aims: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a new strategy-based computerized CR programme (CIRCuiTS) for people with psychosis. Method: Four studies were conducted using mixed methods. Perceptions of attractiveness, comprehensibility, acceptability and usability were assessed using self-report questionnaires in 34 non-clinical participants (study 1), and five people with a schizophrenia diagnosis and three experienced CR therapists (studies 2 and 3). The ease with which pre-specified therapy programmes could be assembled was also assessed by three therapists (Study 2). Finally, the satisfaction of 20 service users with a diagnosis of schizophrenia regarding their experience of using CIRCuiTS in the context of a course of the CR therapy was assessed in a qualitative interview study (study 4). Results: Ratings of perceived attractiveness, comprehensibility, acceptability and usability consistently exceeded pre-set high targets by non-clinical, clinical and therapist participants. Qualitative analysis of satisfaction with CIRCuiTS showed that receiving the therapy was generally seen to be a positive experience, leading to perceptions that cognitive functioning had improved and attempts to incorporate new strategy use into daily activities. Conclusions: CIRCuiTS demonstrates high acceptability and ease of use for both service users with a schizophrenia diagnosis and clinicians.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acceptability", "cognition", "cognitive remediation", "feasibility", "Schizophrenia", "service user"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognitive Remediation", "Cognitive Therapy", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reproducibility of Results", "Schizophrenia", "Self Report", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Therapy, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929791814", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"36839453000": {"Name": "Reeder C.", "AuthorID": "36839453000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, Department of Psychology"}, "56593094500": {"Name": "Pile V.", "AuthorID": "56593094500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, Department of Psychology"}, "56654852600": {"Name": "Crawford P.", "AuthorID": "56654852600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, Department of Psychology"}, "24333907400": {"Name": "Cella M.", "AuthorID": "24333907400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, Department of Psychology"}, "7401709690": {"Name": "Rose D.", "AuthorID": "7401709690", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, Department of Psychology"}, "7005058916": {"Name": "Wykes T.", "AuthorID": "7005058916", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, Department of Psychology"}, "56581079800": {"Name": "Watson A.", "AuthorID": "56581079800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7801668191": {"Name": "Huddy V.", "AuthorID": "7801668191", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57204348531": {"Name": "Callard F.", "AuthorID": "57204348531", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "University of Durham"}}}
