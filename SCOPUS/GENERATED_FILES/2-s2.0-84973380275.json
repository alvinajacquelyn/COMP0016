Side information is an additional signal correlated with the signal of interest. We investigate the impact of side information on classification and signal recovery from low-dimensional measurements. Motivated by real applications, two special cases of the general model are studied. In the first, a joint Gaussian mixture model is manifested on the signal and side information. The second example again employs a Gaussian mixture model for the signal, with side information drawn from a mixture in the exponential family. Theoretical results on recovery and classification accuracy are derived. The presence of side information is shown to yield improved performance, both theoretically and experimentally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compressive sensing", "dimensionality reduction", "side information"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973380275", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"35070860700": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "35070860700", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "57188549342": {"Name": "Yuan X.", "AuthorID": "57188549342", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "35586083000": {"Name": "Calderbank R.", "AuthorID": "35586083000", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "7004561693": {"Name": "Carin L.", "AuthorID": "7004561693", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University"}, "24802572900": {"Name": "Renna F.", "AuthorID": "24802572900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202521476": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "7202521476", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
