Here we show that expression of Nadk , an NAD+ kinase-encoding gene, governs NADP biosynthesis in vivo and is essential for development in Xenopus frog embryos. Unexpectedly, we found that embryonic Nadk expression is dynamic, showing cell type-specific up-regulation during both frog and sea urchin embryogenesis. We analyzed the NAD kinases (NADKs) of a variety of deuterostome animals, finding two conserved internal domains forming a catalytic core but a highly divergent N terminus. One type of N terminus (found in basal species such as the sea urchin)mediates direct catalytic activation of NADK by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM), whereas the other (typical for vertebrates) is phosphorylated by a CaM kinase-dependent mechanism. This work indicates that animal NADKs govern NADP biosynthesis in vivo and are regulated by evolutionarily divergent and conserved CaM-dependent mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium signaling", "Deuterostome animals", "Metabolism", "NAD kinase", "NADP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Base Sequence", "Biological Evolution", "Calmodulin", "DNA Primers", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "In Situ Hybridization", "NADP", "Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Xenopus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922261836", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"28267840300": {"Name": "Love N.", "AuthorID": "28267840300", "AffiliationID": "60000184", "AffiliationName": "Organogenesis and Neurogenesis Team, RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology"}, "23010189000": {"Name": "Pollak N.", "AuthorID": "23010189000", "AffiliationID": "60015815", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Zellbiologie und Immunologie, Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart"}, "56503967800": {"Name": "D\u00f6llea C.", "AuthorID": "56503967800", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen"}, "56503952200": {"Name": "Nierea M.", "AuthorID": "56503952200", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen"}, "7202530401": {"Name": "Ziegler M.", "AuthorID": "7202530401", "AffiliationID": "60029622", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen"}, "9435902900": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "9435902900", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research, University of Cambridge"}, "7004159799": {"Name": "Amaya E.", "AuthorID": "7004159799", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Healing Foundation Centre, University of Manchester"}, "56503961600": {"Name": "Oliverid P.", "AuthorID": "56503961600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "7403902620": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "7403902620", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
