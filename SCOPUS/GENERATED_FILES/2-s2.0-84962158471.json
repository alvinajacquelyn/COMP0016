The inversion of the limited projection data is an ill-posed problem and needs regularization. Traditional spatial regularization is not well adapted to the dynamic nature of time-lapse tomography since it discards the redundancy of the temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative reconstruction algorithm with a nonlocal regularization term to account for time-evolving datasets. The aim of the proposed nonlocal penalty is to collect the maximum relevant information in the spatial and temporal domains. With the proposed sparsity seeking approach in the temporal space, the computational complexity of the classical nonlocal regularizer is substantially reduced (at least by one order of magnitude). The presented reconstruction method can be directly applied to various big data 4D (x, y, z+time) tomographic experiments in many fields. We apply the proposed technique to modelled data and to real dynamic X-ray microtomography (XMT) data of high resolution. Compared to the classical spatio-temporal nonlocal regularization approach, the proposed method delivers reconstructed images of improved resolution and higher contrast while remaining significantly less computationally demanding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["big data", "Iterative reconstruction", "material science", "nonlocal graphs", "p-Laplacian", "spatio-temporal regularization", "time-lapse", "X-ray microtomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Iterative reconstruction", "Material science", "Nonlocal", "P-Laplacian", "Spatio-temporal regularizations", "time-lapse", "X ray microtomography", "Algorithms", "Animals", "Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Mice", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Tibia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962158471", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57202624222": {"Name": "Kazantsev D.", "AuthorID": "57202624222", "AffiliationID": "113708121", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "54915253600": {"Name": "Guo E.", "AuthorID": "54915253600", "AffiliationID": "113708121", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "7102893317": {"Name": "Withers P.", "AuthorID": "7102893317", "AffiliationID": "113708121", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "113708121", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "16021746200": {"Name": "Kaestner A.", "AuthorID": "16021746200", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Neutron Imaging and Activation Group, Paul Scherrer Institut"}, "6603831496": {"Name": "Lionheart W.", "AuthorID": "6603831496", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, University of Manchester"}, "7004950219": {"Name": "Bent J.", "AuthorID": "7004950219", "AffiliationID": "60029850", "AffiliationName": "Unilever Research"}}}
