In this review, the current thinking with regards to the manufacture of solid amorphous pharmaceutical materials using electrohydrodynamic and gyration-based approaches, melt-spinning approaches, thermal moulding, inkjet printing and 3D printing will be examined in the context of their potential and actual viability as dosage forms. A series of practical examples will be discussed as to how these approaches have been used as means of producing drug delivery systems for a range of delivery systems and treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D extrusion-based printing", "Electrospinning", "Electrospraying", "Inkject printing", "Micro- and Nano-fabrication", "Pressure gyration", "Thermal moudling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Drug delivery vehicles", "Electrospraying", "Micro-fabrication techniques", "Nanofabrication techniques", "Pharmaceutical dosage forms", "Pharmaceutical materials", "Physical characterization", "Thermal moudling", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Drug Liberation", "Nanocomposites", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Polymers", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Technology, Pharmaceutical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955255284", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"13409440100": {"Name": "Qi S.", "AuthorID": "13409440100", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University of East Anglia"}, "55428995000": {"Name": "Craig D.", "AuthorID": "55428995000", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
