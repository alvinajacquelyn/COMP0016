Participants were men aged 70\u201392 years (n = 1286) recruited from UK Primary Care Centres. Outcomes included (i) sarcopenia, defined as low muscle mass (lowest two fifths of the mid-upper arm muscle circumference distribution) accompanied by low muscular strength (hand grip strength < 30 kg) or low physical performance (gait speed \u2264 0.8 m/s); (ii) severe sarcopenia, required all three conditions; (iii) sarcopenic obesity defined as sarcopenia or severe sarcopenia and a waist circumference of > 102 cm. Independent variables included time spent in PA intensities measured by GT3x accelerometers, worn during one week in 2010\u201312. Multinomial regression models were used for cross-sectional analyses relating PA and sarcopenia. In total, 14.2% (n = 183) of men had sarcopenia and a further 5.4% (n = 70) had severe sarcopenia. 25.3% of sarcopenic or severely sarcopenic men were obese. Each extra 30 min per day of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was associated with a reduced risk of severe sarcopenia (relative risk [RR] 0.53, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.30, 0.93) and sarcopenic obesity (RR 0.47 [95% CI 0.27, 0.84]). Light PA (LPA) and sedentary breaks were marginally associated with a reduced risk of sarcopenic obesity. Sedentary time was marginally associated with an increased risk of sarcopenic obesity independent of MVPA (RR 1.18 [95% CI 0.99, 1.40]). MVPA may reduce the risk of severe sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity among older men. Reducing sedentary time and increasing LPA and sedentary breaks may also protect against sarcopenic obesity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Muscle mass", "Physical activity", "Sarcopenia", "Sarcopenic obesity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Exercise", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Male", "Muscle Strength", "Obesity", "Sarcopenia", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985946818", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55219956400": {"Name": "Aggio D.A.", "AuthorID": "55219956400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group"}, "55811454000": {"Name": "Sartini C.", "AuthorID": "55811454000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group"}, "6603773732": {"Name": "Papacosta O.", "AuthorID": "6603773732", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.T.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "56124564300": {"Name": "Ash S.", "AuthorID": "56124564300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Primary Care & Population Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group"}, "6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.J.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Physical Activity Research Group"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St George's University of London"}}}
