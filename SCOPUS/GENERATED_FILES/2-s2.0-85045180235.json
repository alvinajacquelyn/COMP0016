These resonance shifts can be large compared to intrinsic spin linewidths, and it is therefore important to study, understand, and model such effects in order to better predict device performance. We investigate a sample of bismuth donor spins implanted in a silicon chip, on top of which a superconducting aluminum microresonator is fabricated. The on-chip resonator provides two functions: it produces local strain in the silicon due to the larger thermal contraction of the aluminum, and it enables sensitive electron spin-resonance spectroscopy of donors close to the surface that experience this strain. Through finite-element strain simulations, we are able to reconstruct key features of our experiments, including the electron spin-resonance spectra. Our results are consistent with a recently observed mechanism for producing shifts of the hyperfine interaction for donors in silicon, which is linear with the hydrostatic component of an applied strain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Device performance", "Electron spin resonance spectra", "Hydrostatic components", "Hyperfine interactions", "Local environments", "On-chip resonators", "Quantum information processing devices", "Thermal contraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045180235", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"16481208900": {"Name": "Pla J.J.", "AuthorID": "16481208900", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Anzac Parade"}, "55681851200": {"Name": "Mohiyaddin F.A.", "AuthorID": "55681851200", "AffiliationID": "60024266", "AffiliationName": "Quantum Computing Institute, Oak Ridge National Laboratory"}, "7005087193": {"Name": "Morello A.", "AuthorID": "7005087193", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Anzac Parade"}, "55976249100": {"Name": "Bienfait A.", "AuthorID": "55976249100", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60008134, 60106256, 60007816, 60019615", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CEA Saclay"}, "6602493551": {"Name": "Bertet P.", "AuthorID": "6602493551", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60008134, 60106256, 60007816, 60019615", "AffiliationName": "Quantronics Group, SPEC, CEA, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay, CEA Saclay"}, "56201051200": {"Name": "Pica G.", "AuthorID": "56201051200", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St. Andrews"}, "56568373600": {"Name": "Mansir J.", "AuthorID": "56568373600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55613970800": {"Name": "Morton J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55613970800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57193156739": {"Name": "Zeng Z.", "AuthorID": "57193156739", "AffiliationID": "60104653, 60011447", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, CEA, INAC-MEM, L-Sim"}, "6701805585": {"Name": "Niquet Y.M.", "AuthorID": "6701805585", "AffiliationID": "60104653, 60011447", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, CEA, INAC-MEM, L-Sim"}, "7003522639": {"Name": "Schenkel T.", "AuthorID": "7003522639", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Accelerator Technology and Applied Physics Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory"}}}
