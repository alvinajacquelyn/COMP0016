Published by Elsevier Ltd.Potassium alkoxides undergo anti-Markovnikov addition to aryl-substituted alkynes with Z selectivity in DMF as the solvent. The yields and efficiency of the reaction was also found to be enhanced by the addition of a secondary amine ligand such as N,N\u2032-dimethylethylenediamine. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the products, reaction rates and selectivity can be explained via a single electron transfer from the alkoxide to the alkyne. This leads to a radical anion intermediate, which then rapidly combines with the alkoxide to yield a vinyl anion whose lifetime governs the E:Z selectivity observed in the products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alkoxides", "Alkynes", "Electron transfer", "Enol ethers", "Radicals"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930081344", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57211614426": {"Name": "Cuthbertson J.", "AuthorID": "57211614426", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003846767": {"Name": "Wilden J.", "AuthorID": "7003846767", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
