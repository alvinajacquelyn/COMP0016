We report on the impact of pore size, determined using X-ray microtomography, and percentage porosity on the \u03bb of glass foams. Glass foams were prepared by heating powder mixtures of obsolete cathode ray tube (CRT) panel glass, Mn3O4 and carbon as foaming agents, and K3PO4 as additive, to a suitable temperature above Tg, and subsequent cooling. Here, we report for the first time a correlation between \u03bb and pore size in the range 0.10\u20130.16 mm showing a decrease from 57 to 49 mW m\u22121 K\u22121 with increasing the pore size for glass foams with porosities of 87\u201390%. This indicates that the pore structure should be optimized in order to improve the insulating performance of glass foams.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amorphous materials", "Porous materials", "Thermal properties", "X-ray techniques"], "IndexKeywords": ["Glass foams", "Insulating performance", "Powder mixtures", "Subsequent cooling", "X ray microtomography", "X-ray techniques"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064928564", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56865619000": {"Name": "\u00d8stergaard M.B.", "AuthorID": "56865619000", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Bioscience, Aalborg University"}, "55978805800": {"Name": "Petersen R.R.", "AuthorID": "55978805800", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Bioscience, Aalborg University"}, "7101695480": {"Name": "Yue Y.", "AuthorID": "7101695480", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Bioscience, Aalborg University"}, "35090012600": {"Name": "Cai B.", "AuthorID": "35090012600", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, RAL"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "22957724200": {"Name": "K\u00f6nig J.", "AuthorID": "22957724200", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Materials Department, Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute"}}}
