Students\u2019 learning patterns were primarily associated with their emotional states (anxiety vs. enjoyment) and secondarily with their motivational dispositions (clear vision of ideal future selves). Students\u2019 anxiety together with weaker Ideal L2 Self related negatively to their performance at the beginning of the project\u2014performance that they had achieved after several years of EFL instruction. Students\u2019 enjoyment together with greater Ideal L2 Self predicted the extent to which they practiced and developed their L2 speech within the 3-month framework of the project. Results suggest that more frequent L2 use with positive emotions directly impacts acquisition, which may in turn lead to the lessening of negative emotions and better long-term L2 comprehensibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["comprehensibility", "development", "emotion", "foreign language learning", "motivation", "second language speech"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050992496", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"36515364100": {"Name": "Saito K.", "AuthorID": "36515364100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6602700294": {"Name": "Dewaele J.M.", "AuthorID": "6602700294", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57203225462": {"Name": "Abe M.", "AuthorID": "57203225462", "AffiliationID": "60015336", "AffiliationName": "Chuo University"}, "14325014900": {"Name": "In'nami Y.", "AuthorID": "14325014900", "AffiliationID": "60015336", "AffiliationName": "Chuo University"}}}
