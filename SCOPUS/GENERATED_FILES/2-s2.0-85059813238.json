This co- evolution follows relatively simple laws that can be clearly expressed using mathematical models. This paper performs a quantitative analysis, motivated from the perspective of control theory, of a classical model from the literature. The model has been developed using data from an in vivo experimental two-species system where the bacterium Mesorhizobium loti supplies the vitamin B-{12} required for growth to the freshwater green alga Lobomonas rostrata and where the action of the B-{12} riboswitch is known to be a determinant of system behaviour. Analysis of the model both before and after the add-back of nutrients is carried out. A focus is exploring the robustness of the system. The paper first describes a simple model of algal-bacterial growth and analysis is undertaken. The effect of system parameters and control mechanisms is quantified. Motivated by the inherent switching action within the biology, a sliding mode interpretation of the control mechanisms is hypothesized based on knowledge of the maximum carrying capacities for each growth. The results of a range of experiments reported in the literature are used to validate the assertions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial growth", "Classical model", "Control mechanism", "Engineering perspective", "Growth dynamics", "Internal complexity", "Mesorhizobium loti", "Simple modeling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059813238", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"57204730081": {"Name": "Abbadi M.", "AuthorID": "57204730081", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
