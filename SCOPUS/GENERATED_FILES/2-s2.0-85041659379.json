FAK is one of the first molecules recruited to focal adhesions in response to external mechanical stimuli and therefore is a pivotal mediator of cell mechanosignaling, and relays these stimuli to other mechanotransducers within the cytoplasm. Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been identified recently as one of these core mechanotransducers. YAP translocates to the nucleus following changes in cell mechanics to promote the expression of genes implicated in motility, apoptosis, proliferation, and organ growth. Here, we show that FAK controls the nuclear translocation and activation of YAP in response tomechanical activation and submit that the YAP-dependent process of durotaxis requires a cell with an asymmetric distribution of active and inactive FAKmolecules.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Directed migration", "Focal adhesions", "Mechanotransduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Apoptosis", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Focal Adhesion Kinase 1", "Focal Adhesions", "Humans", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Phosphoproteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041659379", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57191091618": {"Name": "Lachowski D.", "AuthorID": "57191091618", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57190090388": {"Name": "Cortes E.", "AuthorID": "57190090388", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57190216827": {"Name": "Robinson B.", "AuthorID": "57190216827", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57190214550": {"Name": "Rice A.", "AuthorID": "57190214550", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "57189524365": {"Name": "Del R\u00edo Hern\u00e1ndez A.E.", "AuthorID": "57189524365", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Cellular and Molecular Biomechanics Laboratory, Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}, "6603058561": {"Name": "Rombouts K.", "AuthorID": "6603058561", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Regenerative Medicine and Fibrosis Group, Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
