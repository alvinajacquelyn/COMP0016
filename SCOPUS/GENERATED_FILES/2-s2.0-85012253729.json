The revised data set was posted on the ASIA and ISCoS websites for 1 month to allow further comments and suggestions. Changes resulting from a Delphi process among experts in children with SCI were included. Members of ISCoS Executive and Scientific Committees and the ASIA board made a final review and approved the data set.Results: The International SCI Bowel Function Basic Data Set (Version 2.0) consists of the following 16 items: date of data collection, gastrointestinal and anal sphincter dysfunction unrelated to SCI, surgical procedures on the gastrointestinal tract, defecation method and bowel-care procedures, average time required for defecation, frequency of defecation, uneasiness, headache or perspiration during defecation, digital stimulation or evacuation of the anorectum, frequency of fecal incontinence, flatus incontinence, need to wear pad or plug, oral laxatives and prokinetics, anti-diarrheal agents, perianal problems, abdominal pain and discomfort and the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score.Conclusion: The International SCI Bowel Function Basic Data Set (Version 2.0) has been developed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Data Collection", "Databases, Factual", "Datasets as Topic", "Digestive System Surgical Procedures", "Gastrointestinal Agents", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Humans", "Internationality", "Spinal Cord Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012253729", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7003288720": {"Name": "Krogh K.", "AuthorID": "7003288720", "AffiliationID": "60023882", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Gastroenterology, Neurogastroenterology Unit, Aarhus University Hospital"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "GI Physiology Unit, University College Hospital"}, "6603690874": {"Name": "Perrouin-Verbe B.", "AuthorID": "6603690874", "AffiliationID": "60007723, 60028048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, St Jacques Hospital, University Hospital of Nantes"}, "7005347553": {"Name": "Korsten M.A.", "AuthorID": "7005347553", "AffiliationID": "109482989", "AffiliationName": "VA National Center for the Medical Consequences of Spinal Cord Injury"}, "7003409807": {"Name": "Mulcahey M.J.", "AuthorID": "7003409807", "AffiliationID": "60015277", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Therapy, Thomas Jefferson University, Jefferson College of Health Professions"}, "7006000013": {"Name": "Biering-S\u00f8rensen F.", "AuthorID": "7006000013", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60006564", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Spinal Cord Injuries, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen"}}}
