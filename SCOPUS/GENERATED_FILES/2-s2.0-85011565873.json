Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdObjective: Although there is emerging evidence for the factorial validity of the distinction between post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and complex PTSD (CPTSD) proposed in ICD-11, such evidence has been predominantly based on using selected items from individual scales that describe these factors. We have attempted to address this gap in the literature by testing a range of alternative models of disorders of traumatic stress using a broader range of symptoms and standardized measures. Method: Participants in this cross-sectional study were a sample of individuals who were referred for psychological therapy to a National Health Service (NHS) trauma centre in Scotland (N = 195). Participants were recruited over a period of 18 months and completed measures of stressful life events, DSM-5 PTSD, emotion dysregulation, self-esteem and interpersonal difficulties. Results: Overall, results indicate that a structural model incorporating six first-order factors (re-experiencing, avoidance of traumatic reminders, sense of threat, affective dysregulation, negative self-concept and disturbances in relationships) and two second-order factors (PTSD and disturbances in self-organization [DSO]) was the best fitting. The model presented with good concurrent validity. Childhood trauma was found to be more strongly associated with DSO than with PTSD. Conclusion: Our results are in support of the ICD-11 proposals for PTSD and CPTSD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["complex post-traumatic stress disorder", "disorders of traumatic stress", "ICD-11", "post-traumatic stress disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Life Change Events", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011565873", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7004128606": {"Name": "Shevlin M.", "AuthorID": "7004128606", "AffiliationID": "60020730", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Ulster University"}, "55113504900": {"Name": "Hyland P.", "AuthorID": "55113504900", "AffiliationID": "60104048", "AffiliationName": "School of Business, National College of Ireland"}, "16425957200": {"Name": "Karatzias T.", "AuthorID": "16425957200", "AffiliationID": "60004120", "AffiliationName": "Rivers Centre for Traumatic Stress, NHS Lothian"}, "55597727900": {"Name": "Fyvie C.", "AuthorID": "55597727900", "AffiliationID": "60004120", "AffiliationName": "Rivers Centre for Traumatic Stress, NHS Lothian"}, "15849417400": {"Name": "Roberts N.", "AuthorID": "15849417400", "AffiliationID": "60138351", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Counselling Directorate, Cardiff and Vale University Health Board"}, "24780669300": {"Name": "Bisson J.I.", "AuthorID": "24780669300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.R.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical, Education & Health Psychology, University College London"}, "35420810100": {"Name": "Cloitre M.", "AuthorID": "35420810100", "AffiliationID": "60028084", "AffiliationName": "National Center for PTSD, Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System"}}}
