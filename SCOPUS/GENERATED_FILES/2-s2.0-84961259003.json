Jung and Erich Neumann was published in 2015. This article attempts to provide insight into the practical task, as well as the theoretical background, of the editing process. The advantages and possibilities of an unabridged edition with an extensive historical contextualization are demonstrated, and compared to the approach of the editors of the Jung Letters and their selection therein of Jung's letters to Neumann. The practical points under consideration include the establishment of the letter corpus, the ascertainment of dates and the chronological arrangement of the letter exchange, as well as the deciphering of handwritten letters. Theoretical aspects under discussion involve the question of the merits of a critical contextualisation and the position of the editor vis-\u00e0-vis the research object. The example of the selecting and editing of Jung's letters to Neumann by Aniela Jaff\u00e9 and Gerhard Adler reveals how drastically the close ties of those editors with Jung, Neumann, and members of the Zurich analytical circles compromised their editorial work at times. The advantage for an editor being able to work from an historical distance is appreciated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Correspondance", "Editing", "Jung", "Neumann"], "IndexKeywords": ["Correspondence as Topic", "Humans", "Jungian Theory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961259003", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"]], "AuthorData": {"56110063900": {"Name": "Liebscher M.", "AuthorID": "56110063900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
