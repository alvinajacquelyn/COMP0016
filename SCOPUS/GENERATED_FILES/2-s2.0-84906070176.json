They are important for certain cognitive functions, such as learning and memory. The hippocampus exhibits prominent oscillations similar to those seen in other parts of the cortex. Due to its highly organised lamellar structure, ex vivo and in vitro preparations from the hippocampus have provided experimental models within which to study network oscillations. As such, experiments in hippocampal slices continue to progress our understanding about both the mechanisms and functions of cortical network oscillations. Here, advances from the past two years are summarised, and the current state of the field discussed. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Clocks", "Hippocampus", "In Vitro Techniques", "Interneurons", "Nerve Net"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84906070176", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56325977700": {"Name": "Butler J.", "AuthorID": "56325977700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Physiological Laboratory"}, "7006225727": {"Name": "Paulsen O.", "AuthorID": "7006225727", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge, Physiological Laboratory"}}}
