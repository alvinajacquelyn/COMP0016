Children with developmental disabilities often suffer with sleep and attention problems, yet their relationship is poorly understood. The present study investigated this association in school-aged children with Down syndrome (DS) and Williams syndrome (WS). Actigraphy and pulse oximetry assessed sleep and sleep-disordered breathing respectively, and attention was tested using a novel visual Continuous Performance Task (CPT).Attentional deficits were evident in both disorder groups. In the TD group, higher scores on the CPT were related to better sleep quality, higher oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), and fewer desaturation events. Sleep quality, duration, and SpO2 variables were not related to CPT performance for children with DS and WS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Actigraphy", "Adolescent", "Attention", "Child", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Oximetry", "Sleep", "Sleep Apnea Syndromes", "Williams Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943449764", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Psychology (miscellaneous)", "PSYC", "3201"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"37074147700": {"Name": "Ashworth A.", "AuthorID": "37074147700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education"}, "12799328500": {"Name": "Dimitriou D.", "AuthorID": "12799328500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education"}, "15757367600": {"Name": "Hill C.M.", "AuthorID": "15757367600", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Neuroscience, School of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "7003649617": {"Name": "Karmiloff-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "7003649617", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck University of London"}}}
