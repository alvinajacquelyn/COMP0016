EDTA and chitosan were used as chelating agents. Calcining and subsequent argon-annealing techniques were used. Analysis of the product by SQUID magnetometry showed that the material exhibited possible spin-glass transition or superparamagnetic behaviour below 50 K. The control of phase formation of the Sr2FexCr2-xO6-y (SFCO) system has been improved and the mechanisms of phase formation were better understood. With further investigations, it is hoped that SFCO series materials will be utilized in the manufacturing of electronic devices, fuel cells and other engineering areas.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analysis of the product", "Annealing techniques", "Crystallographic data", "Electronic device", "Phase formations", "SQUID magnetometry", "Superparamagnetics", "Synthesis and characterizations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049631839", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57195741106": {"Name": "Song G.", "AuthorID": "57195741106", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "56865598000": {"Name": "Terry L.R.", "AuthorID": "56865598000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "57195732127": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez Rojas O.", "AuthorID": "57195732127", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Centre for Functional Nanomaterials, University of Bristol"}, "36616258000": {"Name": "Hall S.R.", "AuthorID": "36616258000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Bristol"}, "32667481600": {"Name": "Bovo L.", "AuthorID": "32667481600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Innovation and Enterprise, University College London"}}}
