We aimed to investigate self-reported use of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to BPPV patients by Lithuanian neurologists, ear, nose, and throat (ENT) physicians, and general practitioners (GPs), and to explore potential reasons for the underuse of the maneuvers. Methods: Neurologists, ENT physicians, and GPs were invited to complete a written questionnaire focused on diagnostic and therapeutic practices related to BPPV. Between-group differences and associations between responses were analyzed statistically. Results: In total, 97 neurologists, 85 ENT physicians and 142 GPs (21.1%, 26.8%, and 5.7%, respectively, of all corresponding licensed Lithuanian physicians) completed the questionnaire. 24% of neurologists, 33% ENT physicians and 50% GPs do not perform diagnostic maneuvers for patients with suspected BPPV, and 28%, 61%, and 84%, respectively, do not perform CRPs. Years of clinical experience was a negative predictor of CRP performance [OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.95\u20130.99), p = 0.001]. Frequent reasons for not performing CRPs were time taken for the procedure, fear of provoking symptoms, and lack of knowledge. All physicians frequently ordered additional imaging or consultations for suspected BPPV and reported prescribing a range of medications. Conclusions: A significant proportion of Lithuanian neurologists, ENT physicians, and GPs do not employ diagnostic maneuvers and CRPs for BPPV patients, contrary to established guidelines. Lack of expertise and time available is a common culprit that leads to unnecessary drug prescribing and investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BPPV", "Canalith repositioning procedure", "Epley maneuver", "Lithuania"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo", "Female", "General Practitioners", "Humans", "Lithuania", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurologists", "Otolaryngologists", "Patient Positioning", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061042454", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"57060554600": {"Name": "Ulyt\u0117 A.", "AuthorID": "57060554600", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University"}, "57192987771": {"Name": "Masili\u016bnas R.", "AuthorID": "57192987771", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University"}, "14062034800": {"Name": "Jatu\u017eis D.", "AuthorID": "14062034800", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University"}, "57094136500": {"Name": "Ryli\u0161kien\u0117 K.", "AuthorID": "57094136500", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University"}, "57205667891": {"Name": "Valan\u010dius D.", "AuthorID": "57205667891", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University"}, "57205668539": {"Name": "Pa\u0161konien\u0117 A.", "AuthorID": "57205668539", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University"}, "6508241824": {"Name": "Lesinskas E.", "AuthorID": "6508241824", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Clinic of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Diseases, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University"}, "6507711283": {"Name": "Kaski D.", "AuthorID": "6507711283", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Motor Neuroscience"}}}
