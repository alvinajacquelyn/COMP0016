However, they are especially prone to missing data, which can compromise the validity of analyses when data are not missing at random. Having many waves of data collection presents opportunity for participants\u2019 responsiveness to be observed over time, which may be informative about missing data mechanisms and thus useful as an auxiliary variable. Modern approaches to handling missing data such as multiple imputation and maximum likelihood can be difficult to implement with the large numbers of auxiliary variables and large amounts of non-monotone missing data that occur in cohort studies. Inverse probability-weighting can be easier to implement but conventional wisdom has stated that it cannot be applied to non-monotone missing data. This paper describes two methods of applying inverse probability-weighting to non-monotone missing data, and explores the potential value of including measures of responsiveness in either inverse probability-weighting or multiple imputation. Simulation studies are used to compare methods and demonstrate that responsiveness in longitudinal studies can be used to mitigate bias induced by missing data, even when data are not missing at random.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cohort attrition", "cohort studies", "inverse probability-weighting", "longitudinal studies", "loss to follow-up", "missing at random", "Missing data", "multiple imputation", "non-monotone missing data", "not missing at random"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biostatistics", "Cohort Studies", "Computer Simulation", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Humans", "Likelihood Functions", "Longitudinal Studies", "Models, Statistical", "Probability"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041954519", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"55257282300": {"Name": "Doidge J.", "AuthorID": "55257282300", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Population Health Research, University of South Australia"}}}
