It is not required that the time-delay is known. A Lyapunov Razumikhin approach is used to deal with the time-delay throughout this chapter. All the developed results consider time-varying delay and there is no limitation on the rate of change of time-delay. A local stabilisation problem is considered for affine nonlinear control systems with uncertainties using a Lyapunov-based approach and sliding mode control techniques. It is not assumed that the nominal system is either linearisable or partially linearisable. Stabilisation of a class of large-scale systems with nonlinear interconnections is also considered. A decentralised static output feedback variable structure control is synthesised and a set of conditions is developed to guarantee that the considered large-scale interconnected systems are stabilised uniformly asymptotically. Examples are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Affine nonlinear control system", "Complex control systems", "Delay independent", "Large-scale interconnected systems", "Nonlinear interconnections", "Output feedback controls", "Static output feedback", "Time varying- delays"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042880407", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56642060300": {"Name": "Edwards C.", "AuthorID": "56642060300", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}}}
