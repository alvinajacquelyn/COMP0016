In this paper we report exploration of the structure-activity relationship for this class of compounds, identifying several simpler compounds with comparable activity. The most promising compound identified, possessing significantly improved water solubility, displayed high levels of bacterial clearance in an in vivo zebrafish embryo model, suggesting this compound series has promise for in vivo treatment of tuberculosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antitubercular Agents", "Aza Compounds", "Bacterial Load", "Coordination Complexes", "Drug Resistance, Bacterial", "Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring", "Macrocyclic Compounds", "Metals, Heavy", "Microbial Sensitivity Tests", "Molecular Structure", "Mycobacterium marinum", "Solubility", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Tuberculosis", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045994483", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57220347893": {"Name": "Spain M.", "AuthorID": "57220347893", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "56486729300": {"Name": "Wong J.K.H.", "AuthorID": "56486729300", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "57201738074": {"Name": "Batten J.M.", "AuthorID": "57201738074", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "57201738907": {"Name": "Jiang X.F.", "AuthorID": "57201738907", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "57201737050": {"Name": "Murage H.E.", "AuthorID": "57201737050", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "57201733981": {"Name": "Orford J.T.", "AuthorID": "57201733981", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "57190608367": {"Name": "Crisologo P.", "AuthorID": "57190608367", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "7007037009": {"Name": "Rutledge P.J.", "AuthorID": "7007037009", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "7202805944": {"Name": "Todd M.H.", "AuthorID": "7202805944", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "55225630700": {"Name": "Nagalingam G.", "AuthorID": "55225630700", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Immunity and Pathogenesis Group, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "7003601814": {"Name": "Triccas J.A.", "AuthorID": "7003601814", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Microbial Immunity and Pathogenesis Group, Department of Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "57204193930": {"Name": "Hortle E.", "AuthorID": "57204193930", "AffiliationID": "60018150, 60003524", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Research Program, Centenary Institute, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital"}, "35811120600": {"Name": "Oehlers S.H.", "AuthorID": "35811120600", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Central Clinical School, Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}}}
