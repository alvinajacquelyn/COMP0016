Here we review some recent studies using virtual characters to study imitation behaviour, with a focus on VR methods. We created virtual characters which demonstrate pointing actions and find that typical adults spontaneously copy action height. In a second study, we are able to create virtual characters which mimic the head movement of a participant in a naturalistic conversation task, but find no evidence for increases in rapport or liking. These studies demonstrate how virtual characters can be used to examine social cognition, and the value of greater interaction between cognitive psychology and computing in future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive psychology", "Head movements", "Pointing action", "Social cognition", "Virtual character"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994513757", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "23390192600": {"Name": "Pan X.S.", "AuthorID": "23390192600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57164501700": {"Name": "Forbes P.", "AuthorID": "57164501700", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "56382039100": {"Name": "Hale J.", "AuthorID": "56382039100", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
