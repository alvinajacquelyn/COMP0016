Results from the phase III SELECT-1 trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) recently added to a number of historical and more contemporary disappointments in targeting KRAS mutant disease, including farnesyl transferase inhibition and synthetic lethality partners such as STK33. This narrative review uses the context of these previous failures to demonstrate how the knowledge gained from these experiences can be used as a platform for exciting advances in NSCLC on the horizon. It now seems clear that mutational subtype (most commonly G12C) of individual mutations is of greater relevance than the categorical evaluation of KRAS mutation presence or otherwise. A number of direct small molecules targeted to these subtypes are in development and have shown promising biological activity, with some in the late stages of preclinical validation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["G12C", "KRAS", "Non-small cell lung cancer", "NSCLC", "RAS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic", "Gain of Function Mutation", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Precision Medicine", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048201692", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"28767789300": {"Name": "Lindsay C.R.", "AuthorID": "28767789300", "AffiliationID": "116738978", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research, Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence London and Manchester"}, "57200772132": {"Name": "Blackhall F.", "AuthorID": "57200772132", "AffiliationID": "116738978", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research, Lung Cancer Centre of Excellence London and Manchester"}, "42561216800": {"Name": "Jamal-Hanjani M.", "AuthorID": "42561216800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College of London Hospital and UCL Cancer Institute"}, "57189580188": {"Name": "Forster M.", "AuthorID": "57189580188", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60109234", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College of London Hospital and UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
