European Journal of Neurology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Academy of Neurology.Background and purpose: Bowel symptoms are well documented in mitochondrial disease. However, data concerning other pelvic organs is limited. A large case\u2013control study has therefore been undertaken to determine the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and sexual dysfunction in adults with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease. Methods: Adults with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease and control subjects were recruited from a specialist mitochondrial clinic. The presence and severity of LUTS and their impact on quality of life, in addition to sexual dysfunction and bowel symptoms, were captured using four validated questionnaires. Subgroup analysis was undertaken in patients harbouring the m.3243A>G MT-TL1 mitochondrial DNA mutation. A subset of patients underwent urodynamic studies to further characterize their LUTS. Results: Data from 58 patients and 19 controls (gender and age matched) were collected. Adults with mitochondrial disease had significantly more overactive bladder (81.5% vs. 56.3%, P = 0.039) and low stream (34.5% vs. 5.3%, P = 0.013) urinary symptoms than controls. Urodynamic studies in 10 patients confirmed that bladder storage symptoms predominate. Despite high rates of LUTS, none of the patient group was receiving treatment. Female patients and those harbouring the m.3243A>G MT-TL1 mutation experienced significantly more sexual dysfunction than controls (53.1% vs. 11.1%, P = 0.026, and 66.7% vs. 26.3%, P = 0.011, respectively). Conclusions: Lower urinary tract symptoms are common but undertreated in adult mitochondrial disease, and female patients and those harbouring the m.3243A>G MT-TL1 mutation experience sexual dysfunction. Given their impact on quality of life, screening for and treating LUTS and sexual dysfunction in adults with mitochondrial disease are strongly recommended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bladder symptoms", "bowel symptoms", "lower gastrointestinal tract symptoms", "lower urinary tract symptoms", "mitochondrial disease", "sexual dysfunction", "urogenital symptoms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondrial Diseases", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065158886", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57003423100": {"Name": "Poole O.V.", "AuthorID": "57003423100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56258963200": {"Name": "Skorupinska I.", "AuthorID": "56258963200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56593282600": {"Name": "Skorupinska M.", "AuthorID": "56593282600", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57204917429": {"Name": "Germain L.", "AuthorID": "57204917429", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57204923416": {"Name": "Kozyra D.", "AuthorID": "57204923416", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57204912466": {"Name": "Holmes S.", "AuthorID": "57204912466", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55798969400": {"Name": "James N.", "AuthorID": "55798969400", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "24490837300": {"Name": "Bugiardini E.", "AuthorID": "24490837300", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57208851936": {"Name": "Quinlivan R.", "AuthorID": "57208851936", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.G.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "24475469100": {"Name": "Pitceathly R.D.S.", "AuthorID": "24475469100", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7402391363": {"Name": "Uchiyama T.", "AuthorID": "7402391363", "AffiliationID": "60120405", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, International University of Health and Welfare Ichikawa Hospital"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "16944908200": {"Name": "Woodward C.", "AuthorID": "16944908200", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Gastro-Intestinal Physiology Unit, University College London Hospital"}}}
