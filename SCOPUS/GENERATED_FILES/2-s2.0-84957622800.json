We review recent developments in the understanding of airborne transmission. We outline approaches to measure transmission in populations and trials and describe the Wells-Riley equation, which is used to estimate transmission risk in indoor spaces. Present research priorities include the identification of effective strategies for tuberculosis infection control, improved understanding of where transmission occurs and the transmissibility of drug-resistant strains, and estimates of the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy on transmission dynamics. When research is planned and interventions are designed to interrupt transmission, resource constraints that are common in high burden settings-including shortages of health-care workers-must be considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Air Microbiology", "Communicable Disease Control", "Cross Infection", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957622800", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"36997613100": {"Name": "Yates T.A.", "AuthorID": "36997613100", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and oTropical Medicine"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, University College London"}, "53982851600": {"Name": "Khan P.Y.", "AuthorID": "53982851600", "AffiliationID": "60072682", "AffiliationName": "Karonga Prevention Study"}, "7404053384": {"Name": "Wood R.", "AuthorID": "7404053384", "AffiliationID": "60000356, 60172628", "AffiliationName": "The Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, Institute of Infectious Disease and Molecular Medicine, University of Cape Town"}, "37034264200": {"Name": "Knight G.M.", "AuthorID": "37034264200", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit, Healthcare Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, Imperial College London"}, "8781712900": {"Name": "White R.G.", "AuthorID": "8781712900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Tuberculosis Modelling Group, London School of Hygiene and oTropical Medicine"}, "14052683900": {"Name": "Moore D.A.J.", "AuthorID": "14052683900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Research, London School of Hygiene and oTropical Medicine"}, "7405402740": {"Name": "Taylor J.G.", "AuthorID": "7405402740", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering, Bartlett School of Environment, Energy and Resources, University College London"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "McHugh T.D.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, University College London"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7202415780": {"Name": "Cohen T.", "AuthorID": "7202415780", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases, Yale School of Public Health"}, "7004225016": {"Name": "Cobelens F.G.", "AuthorID": "7004225016", "AffiliationID": "60024290", "AffiliationName": "KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation"}}}
