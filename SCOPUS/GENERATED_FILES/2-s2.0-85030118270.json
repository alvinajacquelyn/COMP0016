Bulletin of Latin American Research \u00a9 2017 Society for Latin American Studies. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThis article explores three utopian visions which have shaped past and present experiences within Buenos Aires shantytowns: those of upgraded shantytowns, of universal housing, and of a city where shantytowns have been eliminated. The article argues that these visions are collective conceptions that entail a socio-political critique which is translated into space and which points to an ideal future. The visions proposed emerge from the examination of historical evidence and are a key conceptual tool for understanding previous and current discussions of shantytowns in Latin America.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Buenos Aires", "eradication", "shantytowns", "social housing", "upgrade"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030118270", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Development", "SOCI", "3303"]], "AuthorData": {"57195921414": {"Name": "Massidda A.", "AuthorID": "57195921414", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}}}
