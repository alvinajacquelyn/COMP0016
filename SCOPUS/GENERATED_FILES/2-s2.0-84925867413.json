In order to maximize the available data rate and enhance the users mobility within an indoor environment, it is essential to characterize the communication channel. In this paper, we present both analytical and experimental results for a VLC system affected by movement of people for different indoor conditions (i.e., furnished office room, empty hall, and corridor). VLC systems utilize multiple light-emitting diodes mounted in the ceiling and the configuration is based on the nondirected line of sight. We consider random movement of people within the room, focusing on the impacts of shadowing and blocking on mobility and link system performance by investigating changes in the channel characteristics using the cumulative distribution function of the received power distribution and the delay profile. We demonstrate the behaviour of communication channels for different scenarios from corridor, the most robust against people movement induced fading, to the office rooms and halls, the most vulnerable to the received power fluctuation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["channel characterization", "mobile indoor optics", "visible light communications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Channel characteristics", "Channel characterization", "Cumulative distribution function", "Electromagnetic spectra", "Emerging technologies", "Indoor environment", "Movement of peoples", "Visible light communications (VLC)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925867413", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"6508134236": {"Name": "Chvojka P.", "AuthorID": "6508134236", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}}}
