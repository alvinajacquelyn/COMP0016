The anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C), a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase, is regulated by phosphorylation. However, the mechanism remains elusive. Using systematic reconstitution and analysis of vertebrate APC/Cs under physiological conditions, we show how cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) activates the APC/C through coordinated phosphorylation between Apc3 and Apc1. Phosphorylation of the loop domains by CDK1 in complex with p9/Cks2 (a CDK regulatory subunit) controlled loading of coactivator Cdc20 onto APC/C. A phosphomimetic mutation introduced into Apc1 allowed Cdc20 to increase APC/C activity in interphase.These results define a previously unrecognized subunit-subunit communication over a distance and the functional consequences of CDK phosphorylation. Cdc20 is a potential therapeutic target, and our findings may facilitate the development of specific inhibitors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anaphase", "Animals", "Apc1 Subunit, Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome", "Apc3 Subunit, Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome", "Cdc20 Proteins", "Cdh1 Proteins", "Enzyme Activation", "Humans", "Mutation", "Phosphorylation", "Xenopus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964507666", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6602263885": {"Name": "Fujimitsu K.", "AuthorID": "6602263885", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Cycle Control Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7101660479": {"Name": "Grimaldi M.", "AuthorID": "7101660479", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Cycle Control Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "7005880352": {"Name": "Yamano H.", "AuthorID": "7005880352", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cell Cycle Control Group, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
