DNA nanostructures with lipidic anchors are promising as membrane protein mimics because of their high tunability. However, the design features specifying DNA nanostructures' functions in lipid membranes are yet to be fully understood. Here, we show that altering patterns of cholesterol units on a cubic DNA scaffold dramatically changes its interaction mode with lipid membranes. This results in simple design rules that allow a single DNA nanostructure to reproduce multiple membrane protein functions: peripheral anchoring, nanopore behavior, and conformational switching to reveal membrane-binding units. Strikingly, the DNA-cholesterol cubes constitute the first open-walled DNA nanopores, as only a quarter of their wall is made of DNA. This functional diversity can increase our fundamental understanding of membrane phenomena and result in sensing, drug delivery, and cell manipulation tools.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomimetic Materials", "Cholesterol", "DNA", "Membrane Proteins", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Nanopores", "Phosphatidylcholines", "Unilamellar Liposomes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060008876", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"56406481600": {"Name": "Chidchob P.", "AuthorID": "56406481600", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, McGill University"}, "57198882212": {"Name": "Luo X.", "AuthorID": "57198882212", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, McGill University"}, "6602987477": {"Name": "Sleiman H.F.", "AuthorID": "6602987477", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, McGill University"}, "57205445646": {"Name": "Offenbartl-Stiegert D.", "AuthorID": "57205445646", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "8389134100": {"Name": "Howorka S.", "AuthorID": "8389134100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "57195683148": {"Name": "McCarthy D.", "AuthorID": "57195683148", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Vermont"}, "55763761000": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "55763761000", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Vermont"}}}
