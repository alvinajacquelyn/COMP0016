V2-apex bnAbs, which bind a protein-glycan region on HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer, are among the most broad and potent described. We show here that a rare \u201cglycan hole\u201d at the V2 apex is enriched in HIV isolates neutralized by inferred precursors of prototype V2-apex bnAbs. To investigate whether this feature could focus neutralizing responses onto the apex bnAb region, we immunized wild-type rabbits with soluble trimers adapted from these Envs. Potent autologous tier 2 neutralizing responses targeting basic residues in strand C of the V2 region, which forms the core epitope for V2-apex bnAbs, were observed. Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) derived from these animals display features promising for subsequent broadening of the response. Voss et al. show that select V2-apex-focusing immunogens derived from bnAb precursor neutralization-sensitive HIV isolates can reproducibly elicit autologous neutralizing responses to components of the bnAb epitope, including K169/K171 and N156, in a wild-type animal model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bnAbs", "germline targeting", "glycan hole", "HIV", "immunizations", "neutralizing antibodies", "rabbit", "SOSIP trimer", "V2 apex", "vaccine"], "IndexKeywords": ["AIDS Vaccines", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antigens, Viral", "Binding Sites", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Epitopes", "Female", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Immunization", "Neutralization Tests", "Polysaccharides", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical", "Protein Conformation, beta-Strand", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Protein Multimerization", "Rabbits"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030723430", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56147448300": {"Name": "Voss J.E.", "AuthorID": "56147448300", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "23993427200": {"Name": "Andrabi R.", "AuthorID": "23993427200", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "36630795600": {"Name": "McCoy L.E.", "AuthorID": "36630795600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, Faculty of Medical Science, University College London"}, "7402383224": {"Name": "Fuller R.P.", "AuthorID": "7402383224", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "57191417042": {"Name": "Messmer T.", "AuthorID": "57191417042", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "57193744094": {"Name": "Su C.Y.", "AuthorID": "57193744094", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "54788322100": {"Name": "Sok D.", "AuthorID": "54788322100", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "15077827200": {"Name": "Khan S.N.", "AuthorID": "15077827200", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "57209867238": {"Name": "Wyatt R.T.", "AuthorID": "57209867238", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "International AIDS Vaccine Initiative Neutralizing Antibody Center, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "6603829222": {"Name": "Crispin M.", "AuthorID": "6603829222", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}, "7401577043": {"Name": "Burton D.R.", "AuthorID": "7401577043", "AffiliationID": "60022195, 60029929", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard"}, "14028097700": {"Name": "de Val N.", "AuthorID": "14028097700", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "22937874400": {"Name": "Garces F.", "AuthorID": "22937874400", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "55945233700": {"Name": "Ward A.B.", "AuthorID": "55945233700", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "7401743864": {"Name": "Wilson I.A.", "AuthorID": "7401743864", "AffiliationID": "60007103", "AffiliationName": "Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute"}, "55796884800": {"Name": "Pritchard L.K.", "AuthorID": "55796884800", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Glycobiology Institute, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford"}}}
