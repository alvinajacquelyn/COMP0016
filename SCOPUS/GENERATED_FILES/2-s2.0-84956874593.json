Methods: Data on 2999 people were collected prospectively over 4years from physician reports. The primary outcome was the composite of stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) or CV-specific death. Events were blindly adjudicated. The relative hazards of CV events were described from Cox proportional hazards models incorporating patient risk factors, with updated average HbA1c as a time-dependent covariate. The relationship of severe and symptomatic hypoglycaemia (collected during the 6months before yearly ascertainment) with CV and all-cause mortality was examined. Results: A total of 147 primary events were accrued during up to 54months of follow-up. In all, 60 CV-specific deaths, 44 non-fatal MIs and 57 non-fatal strokes occurred, totalling 161 events. There was a significant positive relationship between updated mean HbA1c and primary outcome: hazard ratio (HR) 1.25 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-1.40; p<0.0001]. CV death [HR 1.31 (95% CI 1.10-1.57); p=0.0027] and stroke [HR 1.36 (95% CI 1.17-1.59); p<0.0001] were both strongly associated with HbA1c, while MI was not [HR 1.05 (95% CI 0.83-1.32)]. One or more severe hypoglycaemic episodes affected 175 participants, while 1508 participants experienced one or more symptomatic hypoglycaemic events. We found no relationship between severe/symptomatic hypoglycaemic events and CV-specific/all-cause death. Conclusions: Ongoing poorer glucose control was associated with CV events; hypoglycaemia was not associated with CV-specific/all-cause death.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular risk", "CREDIT", "Glycaemic control", "Hypoglycaemia", "Type 2 diabetes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Canada", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Diabetic Angiopathies", "Diabetic Cardiomyopathies", "Europe", "Female", "Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated", "Humans", "Hyperglycemia", "Hypoglycemia", "Hypoglycemic Agents", "Insulin", "Japan", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956874593", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57204674407": {"Name": "Freemantle N.", "AuthorID": "57204674407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "57205956592": {"Name": "Danchin N.", "AuthorID": "57205956592", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Paris Ren\u00e9 Descartes"}, "6506782660": {"Name": "Calvi-Gries F.", "AuthorID": "6506782660", "AffiliationID": "116202376", "AffiliationName": "AtlanStat"}, "56297875300": {"Name": "Vincent M.", "AuthorID": "56297875300", "AffiliationID": "60010850", "AffiliationName": "Sanofi"}, "24518319800": {"Name": "Home P.D.", "AuthorID": "24518319800", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine-Diabetes, Newcastle University"}}}
