This study highlights the variation in palatal tooth arrangements and reveals clear trends within the evolutionary history of tetrapods. Major changes occurred in the transition between early tetrapods and amphibians on the one hand, and stem amniotes on the other. These changes reflect the function of the palatal dentition, which can play an important role in holding and manipulating food during feeding. Differences in the arrangement of palatal teeth, and in their pattern of loss, likely reflect differences in feeding strategy but also changes in the arrangement of cranial soft tissues, as the palatal dentition works best with a well-developed mobile tongue. It is difficult to explain the loss of palatal teeth in terms of any single factor, but palatal tooth patterns have the potential to provide new information on diet and feeding strategy in extinct taxa.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amniota", "cranial soft anatomy", "evolution", "feeding behavior", "function", "palatal dentition", "tetrapoda"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Dentition", "Extinction, Biological", "Palate", "Phylogeny", "Tooth", "Vertebrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982282518", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"18537006400": {"Name": "Matsumoto R.", "AuthorID": "18537006400", "AffiliationID": "102035604", "AffiliationName": "Kanagawa Prefectural Museum Natural History"}, "57221028950": {"Name": "Evans S.E.", "AuthorID": "57221028950", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London (UCL)"}}}
