Objectives: To identify clinical decisions and practices made for acute cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) patients with respiratory impairments and oropharyngeal dysphagia. Settings: All hospital intensive care units in the UK that admit acute cervical spinal cord injury patients. Methods: Online distribution of a 35-question multiple-choice survey on the clinical management of ventilation, swallowing, nutrition, oral hygiene and communication for CSCI patients, to multi-disciplinary staff based in specialised and non-specialised intensive care units across UK. Results: Responses were received from 219 staff members based in 92 hospitals. Of the 77 units that admitted CSCI patients, 152 participants worked in non-specialised and 30 in specialised units. Non-specialised unit staff showed variations in clinical decisions for respiratory management compared to specialised units with limited use of vital capacity measures and graduated weaning programme, reliance on coughing to indicate aspiration, inconsistent manipulation of tracheostomy cuffs for speech and swallowing and limited use of instrumental assessments of swallowing. Those in specialised units employed a multi-discplinary approach to clinical management of nutritional needs. Conclusions: Variation in the clinical management of respiratory impairments and oropharyngeal dysphagia between specialised and non-specialised units have implications for patient outcomes and increase the risk of respiratory complications that impact mortality. The future development of clinical guidance is required to ensure best practice and consistent care across all units.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Cervical Cord", "Deglutition Disorders", "Health Services Research", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Mouth Diseases", "Pharyngeal Diseases", "Process Assessment, Health Care", "Respiration Disorders", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "United Kingdom", "Deglutition Disorders", "Health Personnel", "Intensive Care Units", "Respiration Disorders", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068816996", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56921648200": {"Name": "McRae J.", "AuthorID": "56921648200", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Speech and Language Therapy Service, London Spinal Cord Injury Centre, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore"}, "7003781894": {"Name": "Emmanuel A.", "AuthorID": "7003781894", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57154237300": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "57154237300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Science, University College London"}, "57203917835": {"Name": "Beeke S.", "AuthorID": "57203917835", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Science, University College London"}}}
