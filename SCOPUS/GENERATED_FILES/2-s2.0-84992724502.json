Although it is often assumed that these internal models of body-representation are used to successfully act upon the environment, only a few studies have actually looked at how body-representation changes influence goal-directed actions, and none have looked at this in relation to body-representation changes induced by sound. The present work examines this question for the first time. Participants reached for a target object before and after adaptation periods during which the sounds produced by their hand tapping a surface were spatially manipulated to induce a representation of an elongated arm. After adaptation, participants' reaching movements were performed in a way consistent with having a longer arm, in that their reaching velocities were reduced. These kinematic changes suggest auditory-driven recalibration of the somatosensory representation of the arm morphology. These results provide support to the hypothesis that one's represented body size is used as a perceptual ruler to measure objects' distances and to accordingly guide bodily actions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action sounds", "Auditory-dependent body-representation", "Body kinematics, goal directed actions", "Body-related sensory inputs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992724502", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"23569030500": {"Name": "Tajadura-Jim\u00e9nez A.", "AuthorID": "23569030500", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Universidad Loyola Andaluc\u00eda"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Bianchi-Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "16425864500": {"Name": "Marquardt T.", "AuthorID": "16425864500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "6508057689": {"Name": "Swapp D.", "AuthorID": "6508057689", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "35792260000": {"Name": "Kitagawa N.", "AuthorID": "35792260000", "AffiliationID": "60025555", "AffiliationName": "NTT Communication Science Laboratories, NTT Corporation"}}}
