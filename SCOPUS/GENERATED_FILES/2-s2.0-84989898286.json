We present a systematic review of the pharmacological treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: Controlled trials and observational studies were identified. Scientific evidence was evaluated according to pre-specified levels of certainty. Results: The evidence supports the use of baclofen, tizanidine and gabapentin as first-line options. Diazepam or dantrolene could be considered if no clinical improvement is seen with the previous drugs. Nabiximols has a positive effect when used as add-on therapy in patients with poor response and/or tolerance to first-line oral treatments. Despite limited evidence, intrathecal baclofen and intrathecal phenol show a positive effect in severe spasticity and suboptimal response to oral drugs. Conclusion: The available studies on spasticity treatment offer some insight to guide clinical practice but are of variable methodological quality. Large, well-designed trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of antispasticity agents and to produce evidence-based treatment algorithms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multiple sclerosis", "pharmacological treatment", "review", "spasticity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amines", "Analgesics", "Baclofen", "Cannabidiol", "Clonidine", "Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids", "Dantrolene", "Diazepam", "Dronabinol", "Drug Combinations", "Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid", "Humans", "Injections, Spinal", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Muscle Relaxants, Central", "Muscle Spasticity", "Phenol"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989898286", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24376504700": {"Name": "Otero-Romero S.", "AuthorID": "24376504700", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Preventive Medicine and Epidemiology Department, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital"}, "6603920140": {"Name": "Sastre-Garriga J.", "AuthorID": "6603920140", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital"}, "7007177960": {"Name": "Montalban X.", "AuthorID": "7007177960", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Department of Neurology-Neuroimmunology, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital"}, "7201788288": {"Name": "Comi G.", "AuthorID": "7201788288", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neurological Department, Institute of Experimental Neurology (INSPE), Scientific Institute Hospital San Raffaele, University Vita-Salute San Raffaele"}, "35372254600": {"Name": "Hartung H.P.", "AuthorID": "35372254600", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University"}, "55663378300": {"Name": "Soelberg S\u00f8rensen P.", "AuthorID": "55663378300", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Danish Multiple Sclerosis Center, Department of Neurology, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"}, "7404597283": {"Name": "Thompson A.J.", "AuthorID": "7404597283", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "7005016182": {"Name": "Vermersch P.", "AuthorID": "7005016182", "AffiliationID": "60107862, 60000905, 60104665", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Lille, INSERM, CHU Lille, Lille Inflammation Research International Center (LIRIC) UMR 995"}, "55801391500": {"Name": "Gold R.", "AuthorID": "55801391500", "AffiliationID": "60108391, 60005322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ruhr University, St. Josef-Hospital"}}}
