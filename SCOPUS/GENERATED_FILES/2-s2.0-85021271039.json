Nonetheless, a significant number of patients and malignancies do not respond to this therapy. To develop a screen for response to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition, it is critical to develop a non-invasive tool to accurately assess dynamic immune checkpoint expression. Here we evaluated non-invasive SPECT/CT imaging of PD-L1 expression, in murine tumor models with varying PD-L1 expression, using high affinity PD-L1-specific nanobodies (Nbs). We generated and characterized 37 Nbs recognizing mouse PD-L1. Among those, four Nbs C3, C7, E2 and E4 were selected and evaluated for preclinical imaging of PD-L1 in syngeneic mice. We performed SPECT/CT imaging in wild type versus PD-L1 knock-out mice, using Technetium-99m (99mTc) labeled Nbs. Nb C3 and E2 showed specific antigen binding and beneficial biodistribution. Through the use of CRISPR/Cas9 PD-L1 knock-out TC-1 lung epithelial cell lines, we demonstrate that SPECT/CT imaging using Nb C3 and E2 identifies PD-L1 expressing tumors, but not PD-L1 non-expressing tumors, thereby confirming the diagnostic potential of the selected Nbs. In conclusion, these data show that Nbs C3 and E2 can be used to noninvasively image PD-L1 levels in the tumor, with the strength of the signal correlating with PD-L1 levels. These findings warrant further research into the use of Nbs as a tool to image inhibitory signals in the tumor environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Immune checkpoints", "Nanobodies", "Programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1", "SPECT/CT imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021271039", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56487807100": {"Name": "Broos K.", "AuthorID": "56487807100", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy (LMCT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "57194620158": {"Name": "Lecocq Q.", "AuthorID": "57194620158", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy (LMCT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "56487868800": {"Name": "Renmans D.", "AuthorID": "56487868800", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy (LMCT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "16201827600": {"Name": "Breckpot K.", "AuthorID": "16201827600", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy (LMCT), Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "8860386600": {"Name": "Keyaerts M.", "AuthorID": "8860386600", "AffiliationID": "60069985", "AffiliationName": "Nuclear Medicine Department, UZ Brussel"}, "57209578200": {"Name": "Nguyen T.", "AuthorID": "57209578200", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Cellular and Molecular Immunology (CMIM), Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "9268219700": {"Name": "Devoogdt N.", "AuthorID": "9268219700", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "In Vivo Cellular and Molecular Imaging Laboratory (ICMI), Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "6701644152": {"Name": "Raes G.", "AuthorID": "6701644152", "AffiliationID": "114283616", "AffiliationName": "Immunomodulation Group, Navarrabiomed-Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6507259181": {"Name": "Escors D.", "AuthorID": "6507259181", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Leuven (KU Leuven)"}, "16028965100": {"Name": "Liston A.", "AuthorID": "16028965100", "AffiliationID": "60019793", "AffiliationName": "Myeloid Cell Immunology Laboratory, VIB Inflammation Research Center"}}}
