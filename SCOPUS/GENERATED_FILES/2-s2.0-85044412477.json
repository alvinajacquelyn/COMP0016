Yet it is not clear how supervision supports good practice or how supervision makes a difference for children and families. In this study, using paired observations of group supervision and family meetings alongside interviews with parents, we explored the link between supervision, practice, and engagement. Considering each data set separately, we found a range of skill levels within the supervision discussions and in the meetings with families. Parents reported generally high levels of satisfaction with the service and in relation to their individual worker. But more importantly, we found a \u201cgolden thread\u201d between certain elements of supervision, more skilful practice, and improved parental engagement. We discuss these key elements in detail and consider what these findings tell us about good supervision and what difference it can make for families and children.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044412477", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"35504016600": {"Name": "Wilkins D.", "AuthorID": "35504016600", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Tilda Goldberg Centre for Social Work and Social Care, University of Bedfordshire"}, "57201351757": {"Name": "Lynch A.", "AuthorID": "57201351757", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Tilda Goldberg Centre for Social Work and Social Care, University of Bedfordshire"}, "57194592733": {"Name": "Antonopoulou V.", "AuthorID": "57194592733", "AffiliationID": "60012622", "AffiliationName": "Tilda Goldberg Centre for Social Work and Social Care, University of Bedfordshire"}}}
