Background: The endocrine RAS is involved in circulatory homeostasis through the pressor action of angiotensin II at its AT1 receptor. However, local RAS regulate growth and inflammation in diverse cells and tissues, and their activity may be suppressed by vitamin D. Intrapancreatic angiotensin II generation has been implicated in the development of AP. Methods: Five hundred forty-four white patients with AP from 3 countries (United Kingdom, 22; Germany, 136; and The Netherlands 386) and 8487 control subjects (United Kingdom 7833, The Netherlands 717) were genotyped for 8 polymorphisms of the RAS/vitamin D systems, chosen on the basis of likely functionality. Results: The angiotensin-converting enzyme I (rather than D) allele was significantly associated with alcohol-related AP when all cohorts were combined (P = 0.03). The renin rs5707 G (rather than A) allele was associated with AP (P = 0.002), infected necrosis (P = 0.025) and mortality (P = 0.046). Conclusions: The association of 2 RAS polymorphisms with AP suggests the need for further detailed analysis of the role of RAS/vitamin D in the genesis or severity of AP, particularly given the ready potential for pharmacological manipulation of this system using existing marketed agents. However, further replication studies will be required before any such association is considered robust, particularly given the significant heterogeneity of AP causation and clinical course.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ACE", "Genetics", "Pancreatitis", "RAS", "Vitamin D"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pancreatitis", "Pancreatitis, Alcoholic", "Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Renin", "Renin-Angiotensin System", "Vitamin D", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930415938", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"26657715000": {"Name": "Skipworth J.R.A.", "AuthorID": "26657715000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Human Health and Performance, University College London"}, "55946935500": {"Name": "Malago M.", "AuthorID": "55946935500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatopancreaticobiliary Surgery, Royal Free Hospital NHS Trust"}, "6507262821": {"Name": "Damink S.W.M.O.", "AuthorID": "6507262821", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "35482685300": {"Name": "Montgomery H.E.", "AuthorID": "35482685300", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatopancreaticobiliary Surgery, Royal Free Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7005442666": {"Name": "Shankar A.", "AuthorID": "7005442666", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatopancreaticobiliary Surgery, Royal Free Hospital NHS Trust"}, "6603532650": {"Name": "Nijmeijer R.M.", "AuthorID": "6603532650", "AffiliationID": "60014983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Rijnstate Hospital"}, "57189998086": {"Name": "Van Santvoort H.C.", "AuthorID": "57189998086", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "6603166269": {"Name": "Besselink M.G.H.", "AuthorID": "6603166269", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, AMC Amsterdam"}, "7403266882": {"Name": "Schulz H.U.", "AuthorID": "7403266882", "AffiliationID": "60072303", "AffiliationName": "General Surgery Department, Medical Faculty of Otto-von-Guericke University"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivimaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "57189230664": {"Name": "Kumari M.", "AuthorID": "57189230664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "25932124200": {"Name": "Cooper J.A.", "AuthorID": "25932124200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, University College London"}, "57191531873": {"Name": "Acharya J.", "AuthorID": "57191531873", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, University College London"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, University College London"}}}
