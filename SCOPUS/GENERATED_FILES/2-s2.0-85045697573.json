Fifty-four participants (48 female) aged 18 to 55 watched a programme that had an advertisement break in the centre. This consisted of 6 advertisements with either fear-inducing or nonfear-inducing content. Participants were tested on their recall and recognition of the advertisement information as well as their recall of the first half and second half of the programme. The results indicated that fear-inducing advertisements were better recalled than those that elicited no fear, and there was also evidence of proactive interference from fear-inducing advertisements on programme recall. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fear", "memory", "proactive", "retroactive", "television"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045697573", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"57201677989": {"Name": "Akram Z.", "AuthorID": "57201677989", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Business School (BI), Nydalveien"}, "7004768888": {"Name": "McClelland A.", "AuthorID": "7004768888", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
