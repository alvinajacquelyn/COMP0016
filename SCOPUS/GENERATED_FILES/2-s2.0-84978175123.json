The sympathetic nervous system is known to regulate immune system function through \u03b2-adrenergic receptors (\u03b2ARs); however, their role in regulating immune cell responses to acute cardiac injury is unknown. Methods: Wild-type (WT) mice were irradiated followed by isoform-specific \u03b2AR knockout (\u03b2ARKO) or WT bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) and after full reconstitution underwent MI surgery. Survival was monitored over time, and alterations in immune cell infiltration after MI were examined through immunohistochemistry. Alterations in splenic function were identified through the investigation of altered adhesion receptor expression. Results: \u03b22ARKO BMT mice displayed 100% mortality resulting from cardiac rupture within 12 days after MI compared with \u224820% mortality in WT BMT mice. \u03b22ARKO BMT mice displayed severely reduced post-MI cardiac infiltration of leukocytes with reciprocally enhanced splenic retention of the same immune cell populations. Splenic retention of the leukocytes was associated with an increase in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, which itself was regulated via \u03b2-arrestin-dependent \u03b22AR signaling. Furthermore, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression in both mouse and human macrophages was sensitive to \u03b22AR activity, and spleens from human tissue donors treated with \u03b2-blocker showed enhanced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression. The impairments in splenic retention and cardiac infiltration of leukocytes after MI were restored to WT levels via lentiviral-mediated re-expression of \u03b22AR in \u03b22ARKO bone marrow before transplantation, which also resulted in post-MI survival rates comparable to those in WT BMT mice. Conclusions: Immune cell-expressed \u03b22AR plays an essential role in regulating the early inflammatory repair response to acute myocardial injury by facilitating cardiac leukocyte infiltration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["immune system", "inflammation", "leukocytes", "myocardial infarction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Female", "Genetic Vectors", "Heart Rupture", "Humans", "Leukocytes", "Macrophages", "Male", "Metoprolol", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Myocardial Infarction", "Neutrophil Infiltration", "Radiation Chimera", "Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-2", "Recombinant Fusion Proteins", "Spleen", "Splenectomy", "Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978175123", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"26429480300": {"Name": "Grisanti L.", "AuthorID": "26429480300", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "8576481000": {"Name": "Gumpert A.", "AuthorID": "8576481000", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "24468990900": {"Name": "Traynham C.", "AuthorID": "24468990900", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "57190179655": {"Name": "Gorsky J.", "AuthorID": "57190179655", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "56176024300": {"Name": "Repas A.", "AuthorID": "56176024300", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "7101941158": {"Name": "Gao E.", "AuthorID": "7101941158", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "7402936734": {"Name": "Carter R.", "AuthorID": "7402936734", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "7404666996": {"Name": "Yu D.", "AuthorID": "7404666996", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "7202369860": {"Name": "Rabinowitz J.", "AuthorID": "7202369860", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "24826262600": {"Name": "Koch W.", "AuthorID": "24826262600", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "57203784339": {"Name": "Tilley D.", "AuthorID": "57203784339", "AffiliationID": "60013936", "AffiliationName": "Center for Translational Medicine, Department of Clinical Sciences, Temple University School of Medicine"}, "7103415724": {"Name": "Calvert J.", "AuthorID": "7103415724", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Emory University School of Medicine"}, "57190171008": {"Name": "Garci\u00e1 A.", "AuthorID": "57190171008", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Spanish National Center for Cardiovascular Research"}, "13907649300": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez B.", "AuthorID": "13907649300", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Spanish National Center for Cardiovascular Research"}}}
