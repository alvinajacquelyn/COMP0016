These individuals draw upon a distinct set of featural details to identify happy and fearful faces that differ from those used by typically developing comparison groups: children and adults. The diagnostic visual information is also notably less interlinked in Williams syndrome, consistent with reports of diminished processing of configural information during face identity judgments. These results prompt reconsideration of typical models of face expertise by revealing that an age-appropriate profile of expression performance can be achieved via alternative routes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Emotions", "Face", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Perception", "Williams Syndrome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029542518", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"16028304500": {"Name": "Ewing L.", "AuthorID": "16028304500", "AffiliationID": "60031806, 60187518", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Western Australia"}, "7003649617": {"Name": "Karmiloff-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "7003649617", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57208382806": {"Name": "Smith M.L.", "AuthorID": "57208382806", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6602319057": {"Name": "Farran E.K.", "AuthorID": "6602319057", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
