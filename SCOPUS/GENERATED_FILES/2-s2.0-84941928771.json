We fix an imaginary quadratic field K and a split prime q of K lying above q and let K<inf>\u221e</inf>/K denote the \u2124<inf>q</inf>-extension which is unramified outside q. We show that if F/K is a finite abelian extension, and if F<inf>\u221e</inf> = FK<inf>\u221e</inf>, then, for a prime p satisfying certain conditions, the p-part of the class groups stabilize in the \u2124<inf>p</inf>-extension F<inf>\u221e</inf>/F. We also show that if E/K is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the ring of integers of K, then under the same conditions on a prime p, the p-part of the Selmer groups for E/F<inf>n</inf> stabilize as F<inf>n</inf> runs over the finite layers of F<inf>\u221e</inf>F.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941928771", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"56181890000": {"Name": "Lamplugh J.", "AuthorID": "56181890000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematical Sciences, University of Cambridge"}}}
