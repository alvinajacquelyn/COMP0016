Especially, there have been a number of fire accidents offshore due to helicopter collision (take-off and/or landing) in recent decades. To prevent further accidents, a substantial amount of effort has been directed toward the management of fire in the safety design of offshore helidecks. The aims of this study are to introduce and apply a procedure for quantitative risk assessment and management of fires by defining the fire loads with an applied example. The frequency of helicopter accidents are considered, and design accidental levels are applied. The proposed procedures for determining design fire loads can be efficiently applied in offshore helideck development projects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Applied example", "Design fire loads", "Fire accidents", "Helicopter collision", "Quantitative risk assessment and management", "Safety design of helidecks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Applied example", "Design fires", "Fire accident", "Helidecks", "Quantitative risk assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996841770", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"57204634281": {"Name": "Kim S.", "AuthorID": "57204634281", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, The Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence, Pusan National University"}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "36890591400": {"Name": "Seo J.", "AuthorID": "36890591400", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, The Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence, Pusan National University"}, "57192075688": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "57192075688", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Pusan National University"}, "56911760600": {"Name": "Shin W.", "AuthorID": "56911760600", "AffiliationID": "101826608", "AffiliationName": "Research Institutes Team, N.K Co.
