Aim: This evaluation aimed to assess uptake, timeliness and completeness of data provided and explore potential barriers and facilitators to adopting the system. Methods: The evaluation comprised a retrospective analysis of surveillance data and semi-structured interviews with ERS users. Findings: The proportion of organisms referred for investigation of carbapenem resistance via ERS increased over the first 12 months post-implementation from 35% to 73%; uptake varied widely across regions of England. Completeness of enhanced data fields was poor in 78% of submitted isolates. The median number of days to report confirmatory test results via ERS was 1 day for the regional service and nine days for the national reference laboratory, which additionally conducts phenotypic testing to confirm carbapenemase negativity. Hindrances to ERS utility included: a lack of designated, ongoing resource for system maintenance, technical support and development; uncertainty about how and when to use ERS and workload. Incomplete data prevented gaining a better understanding of important risk factors and transmission routes of CPGNB in England. Conclusion: The ERS is the only surveillance system in England with the potential to gather intelligence on important risk factors for CPGNB to inform public health measures to control their spread. Although the ERS captures more information on CPGNB than other surveillance systems, timeliness and completeness of the enhanced data require substantial improvements in order to deliver the desired health benefits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria", "Electronic reporting system", "Evaluation", "Public Health England", "Surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial Proteins", "beta-Lactamases", "Disease Notification", "Electronic Data Processing", "England", "Epidemiological Monitoring", "Gram-Negative Bacteria", "Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections", "Health Services Research", "Interviews as Topic", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061307004", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55821297800": {"Name": "Jermacane D.", "AuthorID": "55821297800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57122490200": {"Name": "Coope C.M.", "AuthorID": "57122490200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Evaluation of Interventions, University of Bristol"}, "55944594300": {"Name": "Ironmonger D.", "AuthorID": "55944594300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "36666130000": {"Name": "Cleary P.", "AuthorID": "36666130000", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "15751395500": {"Name": "Puleston R.", "AuthorID": "15751395500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "20434226400": {"Name": "Oliver I.", "AuthorID": "20434226400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Evaluation of Interventions, University of Bristol"}, "20735229800": {"Name": "Muller-Pebody B.", "AuthorID": "20735229800", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Division of Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "12809291900": {"Name": "Hope R.", "AuthorID": "12809291900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Division of Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7202260726": {"Name": "Hopkins S.", "AuthorID": "7202260726", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Division of Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "55228337300": {"Name": "Freeman R.", "AuthorID": "55228337300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Division of Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57206470677": {"Name": "Hopkins K.L.", "AuthorID": "57206470677", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Division of Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7410016381": {"Name": "Johnson A.P.", "AuthorID": "7410016381", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Division of Healthcare-Associated Infection and Antimicrobial Resistance, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7005737009": {"Name": "Woodford N.", "AuthorID": "7005737009", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "National Infection Service Laboratories, Public Health England"}}}
