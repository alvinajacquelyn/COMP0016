All rights reserved.Videothoracic surgery for lung cancer is now an established practice but there is a division of opinion between surgeons whose aim is to spare all patients a thoracotomy and those who have not adopted videoscopic methods for routine lobectomy. The latter remain in the majority; most patients at present have a thoracotomy. Surgeons from Europe and America met in Catania, Sicily at the 3rd Mediterranean Symposium on Thoracic Surgical Oncology to explore the evidence and the routes to making videothoracoscopic surgery a standard of care. Evidence from one completed randomized controlled trial (RCT) and several propensity score matching studies indicate that less invasive surgery is at least as safe as thoracotomy. By the accepted standards of an oncological lobectomy which include clearance of the primary cancer and the intended lymphadenectomy or sampling, the operations are equivalent. Clinical effectiveness in achieving long-term cancer free survival is likely. However, the co-existance of videothoracoscopy has encouraged smaller nonmuscle cutting incisions and the avoidance of rib spreading, narrowing whatever gap there may have been in terms of the patients' experience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lobectomy", "Lung cancer", "Videothoracoscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990188521", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57196678944": {"Name": "Treasure T.", "AuthorID": "57196678944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, University College London"}}}
