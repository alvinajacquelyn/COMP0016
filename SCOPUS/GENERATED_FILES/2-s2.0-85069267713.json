Due to this finding we sought to understand the possible genetic risk contributed by the BACE2 locus to the development of late-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). In this study, we report that common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variation in BACE2 is associated with altered AD risk in apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) epsilon 4 variant (\u03b54) non-carriers. In addition, in \u03b54 non-carriers diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), SNPs within the BACE2 locus are associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of A\u03b21-42. Further, SNP variants in BACE2 are also associated with BACE2 RNA expression levels suggesting a potential mechanism for the CSF A\u03b21-42 findings. Lastly, overexpression of BACE2 in vitro resulted in decreased A\u03b21-40 and A\u03b21-42 fragments in a cell line model of A\u03b2 production. These findings suggest that genetic variation at the BACE2 locus modifies AD risk for those individuals who don\u2019t carry the \u03b54 variant of APOE. Further, our data indicate that the biological mechanism associated with this altered risk is linked to amyloid generation or clearance possibly through BACE2 expression changes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Cohort Studies", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069267713", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57194555559": {"Name": "Huentelman M.", "AuthorID": "57194555559", "AffiliationID": "108558389", "AffiliationName": "The Arizona Alzheimer\u2019s Consortium"}, "56495203300": {"Name": "De Both M.", "AuthorID": "56495203300", "AffiliationID": "108558389", "AffiliationName": "The Arizona Alzheimer\u2019s Consortium"}, "57196257526": {"Name": "Jepsen W.", "AuthorID": "57196257526", "AffiliationID": "108558389", "AffiliationName": "The Arizona Alzheimer\u2019s Consortium"}, "8045819400": {"Name": "Piras I.S.", "AuthorID": "8045819400", "AffiliationID": "108558389", "AffiliationName": "The Arizona Alzheimer\u2019s Consortium"}, "24176254700": {"Name": "Talboom J.S.", "AuthorID": "24176254700", "AffiliationID": "108558389", "AffiliationName": "The Arizona Alzheimer\u2019s Consortium"}, "57202383599": {"Name": "Willeman M.", "AuthorID": "57202383599", "AffiliationID": "108558389", "AffiliationName": "The Arizona Alzheimer\u2019s Consortium"}, "7005957089": {"Name": "Reiman E.M.", "AuthorID": "7005957089", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Arizona"}, "57207702422": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "57207702422", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Reta Lilla Weston Laboratories, and UK Dementia Research Institute at University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "13308155800": {"Name": "Myers A.J.", "AuthorID": "13308155800", "AffiliationID": "60021519, 60029251, 60015206", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences, Programs in Neuroscience and Human Genetics and Genomics and Center on Aging, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami"}}}
