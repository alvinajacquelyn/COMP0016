KGaA, Weinheim.Single-source zinc \u03b2-iminoesterate precursors have been used for the first time in the aerosol-assisted chemical-vapour deposition (AACVD) of ZnO thin films. Depositions at 450\u00b0C on silica-coated glass substrates produced strongly adherent films with excellent coverage of the substrate. The zinc \u03b2-iminoesterates [Zn(L<inf>1</inf>)<inf>2</inf>] (1) and [Zn(L<inf>2</inf>)<inf>2</inf>] (2) were synthesised by the reaction between ZnEt<inf>2</inf> and 2 equiv. of a synthesised \u03b2-iminoester ligand CH<inf>3</inf>C[NHCH(CH<inf>3</inf>)<inf>2</inf>]CHC(O)OCH<inf>2</inf>CH<inf>3</inf> (L<inf>1</inf>) and CH<inf>3</inf>C(NHCH<inf>3</inf>)CHC(O)OCH<inf>2</inf>CH<inf>3</inf> (L<inf>2</inf>). The synthesised complexes were isolated and characterised by <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and thermal gravitational analysis (TGA). The structures of the compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The ZnO films deposited from 1 and 2 were analyzed by glancing-angle X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and their optical properties determined by UV/Vis/NIR transmission spectroscopy. These results reveal that the organic ligand attached to the N moiety of the zinc complex has a significant effect on the level of carbon incorporated into the deposited thin film. Upon annealing, highly transparent hexagonal wurtzite ZnO thin films were produced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemical vapor deposition", "N,O ligands", "Precursor development", "Single-source precursors", "Thin films", "Zinc oxide"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938737949", "SubjectAreas": [["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"56550091500": {"Name": "Manzi J.A.", "AuthorID": "56550091500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24923462200": {"Name": "Knapp C.E.", "AuthorID": "24923462200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
