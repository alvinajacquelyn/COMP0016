This study evaluates the implementation of the radiologic aspects of HERBY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed multimodal imaging compliance rates and scan quality for participating sites, adjudication rates and reading times for the central review process, the influence of different Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria in the final response, the incidence of pseudoprogression, and the benefit of incorporating multimodal imaging into the decision process. RESULTS: Multimodal imaging compliance rates were the following: diffusion, 82%; perfusion, 60%; and spectroscopy, 48%. Neuroradi-ologists\u2019 responses differed for 50% of scans, requiring adjudication, with a total average reading time per patient of approximately 3 hours. Pseudoprogression occurred in 10/116 (9%) cases, 8 in the radiation therapy/temozolomide arm and 2 in the bevacizumab arm (P .01). Increased target enhancing lesion diameter was a reason for progression in 8/86 cases (9.3%) but never the only radiologic or clinical reason. Event-free survival was predicted earlier in 5/86 (5.8%) patients by multimodal imaging (diffusion, n 4; perfusion, n 1). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of multimodal imaging to the response criteria modified the assessment in a small number of cases, determining progression earlier than structural imaging alone. Increased target lesion diameter, accounting for a large proportion of reading time, was never the only reason to designate disease progression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bevacizumab", "Brain Stem Neoplasms", "Chemoradiotherapy", "Child", "Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic", "Disease Progression", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Glioma", "Humans", "Male", "Multicenter Studies as Topic", "Multimodal Imaging", "Neuroimaging", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Temozolomide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062952359", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7003384098": {"Name": "Jaspan T.", "AuthorID": "7003384098", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals, Department of Radiology, UK National Institute of Health Research"}, "56562463500": {"Name": "Rodriguez D.", "AuthorID": "56562463500", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Clinical Engineering, UK National Institute of Health Research"}, "7402394282": {"Name": "Morgan P.S.", "AuthorID": "7402394282", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60172935", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, UK National Institute of Health Research"}, "57200620408": {"Name": "Chambers T.", "AuthorID": "57200620408", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University, School of Medicine"}, "35838553900": {"Name": "Warmuth-Metz M.", "AuthorID": "35838553900", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "W\u00fcrzburg University, Institute for Diagnostic and Interventional Neuroradiology"}, "57204840720": {"Name": "Sanchez Aliaga E.", "AuthorID": "57204840720", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Center, Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine"}, "16025872900": {"Name": "Warren D.", "AuthorID": "16025872900", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Teaching Hospital, Department of Radiology"}, "35363679700": {"Name": "Calmon R.", "AuthorID": "35363679700", "AffiliationID": "60021567", "AffiliationName": "Assistance Publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, Pediatric Radiology"}, "7005105026": {"Name": "Vassal G.", "AuthorID": "7005105026", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106080", "AffiliationName": "Gustave Roussy and Paris-Sud University, Pediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Unite Mixte de Recherche"}, "7005802262": {"Name": "Grill J.", "AuthorID": "7005802262", "AffiliationID": "60106017, 60106080", "AffiliationName": "Gustave Roussy and Paris-Sud University, Pediatric and Adolescent Oncology, Unite Mixte de Recherche"}, "57210349888": {"Name": "Hargrave D.", "AuthorID": "57210349888", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital, Haematology and Oncology Department"}, "56423926200": {"Name": "Garcia J.", "AuthorID": "56423926200", "AffiliationID": "60008201", "AffiliationName": "F.
