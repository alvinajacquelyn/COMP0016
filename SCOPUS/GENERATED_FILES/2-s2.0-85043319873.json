We conducted a prospective study of children with primary gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease, for whom symptoms of dysphagia were determined pre-operatively and then post-operatively and we examined for features that may predict post-operative dysphagia. Methods: Thirteen children (aged 6.8\u201315.5 years) undergoing work-up prior to 360o Nissen fundoplication were included in the study. A dysphagia score assessed symptoms at pre-operative study and post-operatively (mean 1.4 years). A HRIM procedure recorded 5-ml liquid, 5-ml viscous and 2-cm solid boluses. We assessed esophageal motility, esophago-gastric junction (EGJ) morphology, EGJ contractility and pressure-flow variables indicative of bolus distension pressures and bolus clearance pressures. A composite pressure-flow index score was also derived. Results: Pre-operative pressure-flow index was positively correlated with post-operative dysphagia score (viscous bolus r = 0.771, p < 0.005). Of three variables that comprise the pressure-flow index, the ramp pressure measured during bolus clearance was the main driver of the effect seen (viscous bolus r = 0.819, p < 0.005). Conclusions: In order to mitigate symptoms in relation to anti-reflux surgery, dysphagia symptoms and esophageal function need to be pre-operatively assessed. In patients with normal motility, an elevated pressure-flow index may predict post-operative dysphagia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnosis", "dysphagia", "fundoplication", "Gastroesophageal reflux"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043319873", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"7003509457": {"Name": "Omari T.", "AuthorID": "7003509457", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University"}, "55204342900": {"Name": "Ferris L.", "AuthorID": "55204342900", "AffiliationID": "60020828", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University"}, "6603992031": {"Name": "Connor F.", "AuthorID": "6603992031", "AffiliationID": "60022632", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Children's Hospital"}, "23005273800": {"Name": "McCall L.", "AuthorID": "23005273800", "AffiliationID": "60015153", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, Women's & Children's Hospital"}, "57201068472": {"Name": "Ellison S.", "AuthorID": "57201068472", "AffiliationID": "60015153", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, Women's & Children's Hospital"}, "56464186400": {"Name": "Abu-Assi R.", "AuthorID": "56464186400", "AffiliationID": "60015153", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, Women's & Children's Hospital"}, "57202594248": {"Name": "Moore D.", "AuthorID": "57202594248", "AffiliationID": "60015153", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology Unit, Women's & Children's Hospital"}, "7102037062": {"Name": "Hanson B.", "AuthorID": "7102037062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102704851": {"Name": "Khurana S.", "AuthorID": "7102704851", "AffiliationID": "60015153", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Surgery & Urology, Women's & Children's Hospital"}}}
