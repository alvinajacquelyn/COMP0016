This term was originally used by Peacock in 1938 to describe a condition of painful induration and erection of the penis due to metastatic infiltration by a neoplasm. In the current literature there are 512 case reports. The primary tumor sites are bladder, prostate and rectum. The treatment has only palliative intent and consists of local tumor excision, penectomy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We present one case of malignant priapism originated from prostate cancer, and two from urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Different approaches in diagnosis and therapy were performed. The entire three patient reported a relief of the pain following the treatment, with an improvement of their quality of life, even though it was only temporary as a palliative. Malignant priapism is a rare medical emergency. Penile/pelvis magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and corporal biopsies are considered an effective method of diagnosis of the primary organ site.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metastases", "Priapism", "Tumour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Carcinoma, Transitional Cell", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Penile Neoplasms", "Priapism", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Quality of Life", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986224371", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56888430600": {"Name": "De Luca F.", "AuthorID": "56888430600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "St Peter's Andrology and the Insitute of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "St Peter's Andrology and the Insitute of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "24765500600": {"Name": "Zacharakis E.", "AuthorID": "24765500600", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Guy's Hospital, Kings College London"}, "6603862069": {"Name": "Shabbir M.", "AuthorID": "6603862069", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Guy's Hospital, Kings College London"}, "56069912000": {"Name": "Maurizi A.", "AuthorID": "56069912000", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic-Obstetric Sciences and Urological Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "14823170000": {"Name": "De Dominicis C.", "AuthorID": "14823170000", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecologic-Obstetric Sciences and Urological Sciences, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57190836536": {"Name": "Manzi E.", "AuthorID": "57190836536", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Surgery, Organ Transplantation Sapienza, University of Rome"}, "6701732622": {"Name": "Zangh\u00ec A.", "AuthorID": "6701732622", "AffiliationID": "60010146", "AffiliationName": "General Surgery and Breast Unit, Department of Surgery, University of Catania"}}}
