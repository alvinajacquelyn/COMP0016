Here, we show that PKC\u03b9 is overexpressed and activated in patient derived GSCs compared with normal neural stem cells and normal brain lysate, and that silencing of PRKCI in GSCs causes apoptosis, along with loss of clonogenicity and reduced proliferation. Notably, PRKCI silencing reduces tumor growth in vivo in a xenograft mouse model. PKC\u03b9 has been intensively studied as a therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer, resulting in the identification of an inhibitor, aurothiomalate (ATM), which disrupts the PKC\u03b9/ERK signaling axis. However, we show that, although sensitive to pharmacological inhibition via a pseudosubstrate peptide inhibitor, GSCs are much less sensitive to ATM, suggesting that PKC\u03b9 acts along a different signaling axis in GSCs. Gene expression profiling of PRKCI-silenced GSCs revealed a novel role of the Notch signaling pathway in PKC\u03b9 mediated GSC survival. A proximity ligation assay showed that Notch1 and PKC\u03b9 are in close proximity in GSCs. Targeting PKC\u03b9 in the context of Notch signaling could be an effective way of attacking the GSC population in GBM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["atypical protein kinase C iota", "glioblastoma", "glioblastoma stem-like cells", "notch signaling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981187962", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56029611200": {"Name": "Phillips E.", "AuthorID": "56029611200", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "DKFZ Junior Group Brain Tumor Translational Targets, German Cancer Research Center"}, "57190194236": {"Name": "Bethke F.", "AuthorID": "57190194236", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "DKFZ Junior Group Brain Tumor Translational Targets, German Cancer Research Center"}, "12142159900": {"Name": "Puccio L.", "AuthorID": "12142159900", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "DKFZ Junior Group Brain Tumor Translational Targets, German Cancer Research Center"}, "7102379763": {"Name": "Lichter P.", "AuthorID": "7102379763", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "DKFZ Junior Group Brain Tumor Translational Targets, German Cancer Research Center"}, "6508084340": {"Name": "Goidts V.", "AuthorID": "6508084340", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "DKFZ Junior Group Brain Tumor Translational Targets, German Cancer Research Center"}, "55556988100": {"Name": "Lang V.", "AuthorID": "55556988100", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center"}, "56769295200": {"Name": "Bohlen J.", "AuthorID": "56769295200", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center"}, "40262587200": {"Name": "Tichy D.", "AuthorID": "40262587200", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center"}, "25931544000": {"Name": "Hielscher T.", "AuthorID": "25931544000", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, German Cancer Research Center"}, "6604063528": {"Name": "Herold-Mende C.", "AuthorID": "6604063528", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, University of Heidelberg"}}}
