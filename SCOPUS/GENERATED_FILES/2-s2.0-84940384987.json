The central block of synthesized photochromic block copolymers contains 80 PhM groups, while the length of \"peripheral\" blocks includes 4 or 10 Azo units. The microphase separation structure is observed in the block copolymer when the length of a subblock with Azo groups reaches ten monomeric units. The influence of photochromic polymers' molecular architecture (homopolymer, block copolymer and random copolymer) on the photochemical and photoorientation processes induced by light in their amorphous films has been revealed. The optical anisotropy induced in block copolymer films by illumination with linearly polarized 546 nm light was studied and the results were compared with those of the Azo homopolymer and of a random copolymer with a similar composition. It was found that practically only Azo groups are included in the process of photoinduced orientation in films of block copolymers, whereas the orientational cooperative effect of both azobenzene chromophore and phenyl benzoate mesogenic groups is observed in the case of a random copolymer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Azobenzene chromophore", "Block copolymer films", "Co-operative effects", "Microphase separation structures", "Molecular architecture", "Photochromic azobenzene", "Photochromic polymers", "Photoinduced orientation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940384987", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"7006282903": {"Name": "Boiko N.I.", "AuthorID": "7006282903", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, Moscow State University"}, "55777176600": {"Name": "Bugakov M.A.", "AuthorID": "55777176600", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, Moscow State University"}, "7004258654": {"Name": "Chernikova E.V.", "AuthorID": "7004258654", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, Moscow State University"}, "7102730209": {"Name": "Shibaev V.P.", "AuthorID": "7102730209", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry, Moscow State University"}, "56017908600": {"Name": "Piryazev A.A.", "AuthorID": "56017908600", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Fundamental Physical and Chemical Engineering, Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU), GSP-1"}, "55211283400": {"Name": "Odarchenko Y.I.", "AuthorID": "55211283400", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Fundamental Physical and Chemical Engineering, Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU), GSP-1"}, "7202335053": {"Name": "Ivanov D.A.", "AuthorID": "7202335053", "AffiliationID": "60104405", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Sciences des Mat\u00e9riaux de Mulhouse, CNRS UMR 7361"}}}
