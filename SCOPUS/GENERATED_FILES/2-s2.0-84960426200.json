One promising avenue for global-scale quantum communication networks is to use low-Earth-orbit satellites. Here we report the first demonstration of QKD from a stationary transmitter to a receiver platform traveling at an angular speed equivalent to a 600 km altitude satellite, located on a moving truck. We overcome the challenges of actively correcting beam pointing, photon polarization and time-of-flight. Our system generates an asymptotic secure key at 40 bits/s.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Angular speed", "Beam pointing", "Free spaces", "Global scale", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Photon polarization", "Single link", "Time of flight"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960426200", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"35777466000": {"Name": "Bourgoin J.", "AuthorID": "35777466000", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "23004569600": {"Name": "Higgins B.", "AuthorID": "23004569600", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "55506920500": {"Name": "Gigov N.", "AuthorID": "55506920500", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "7101643482": {"Name": "Holloway C.", "AuthorID": "7101643482", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "56072760400": {"Name": "Pugh C.", "AuthorID": "56072760400", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "56589517200": {"Name": "Kaiser S.", "AuthorID": "56589517200", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "57188670721": {"Name": "Cranmer M.", "AuthorID": "57188670721", "AffiliationID": "60014171", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Waterloo"}, "6701569164": {"Name": "Jennewein T.", "AuthorID": "6701569164", "AffiliationID": "60082875", "AffiliationName": "Quantum Information Science Program, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research"}}}
