All rights reserved.Hominin evolution sawthe emergence of two traits\u2014bipedality and encephalization\u2014that are fundamentally linked because the fetal head must pass through the maternal pelvis at birth, a scenario termed the \u2018obstetric dilemma\u2019. While adaptive explanations for bipedality and large brains address adult phenotype, it is brain and pelvic growth that are subject to the obstetric dilemma. Many contemporary populations experience substantial maternal and perinatal morbidity/mortality from obstructed labour, yet there is increasing recognition that the obstetric dilemma is not fixed and is affected by ecological change. Ecological trends may affect growth of the pelvis and offspring brain to different extents, while the two traits also differ by a generation in the timing of their exposure. Two key questions arise: how can the fit between the maternal pelvis and the offspring brain be \u2018renegotiated\u2019 as the environment changes, and what nutritional signals regulate this process? I argue that the potential for maternal size to change across generations precludes birthweight being under strong genetic influence. Instead, fetal growth tracks maternal phenotype, which buffers short-term ecological perturbations. Nevertheless, rapid changes in nutritional supply between generations can generate antagonistic influences on maternal and offspring traits, increasing the risk of obstructed labour.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptation", "Birthweight", "Encephalization", "Fistula", "Nutrition transition", "Obstetric dilemma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Biological", "Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Body Size", "Brain", "Female", "Gait", "Hominidae", "Humans", "Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Obstetric Labor Complications", "Organ Size", "Pelvis", "Pregnancy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922309569", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55603815000": {"Name": "Wells J.", "AuthorID": "55603815000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Childhood Nutrition Research Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
