In preclinical models, the combination of a PDE5 inhibitor (PDE5i) with a neprilysin inhibitor augments natriuretic peptide bioactivity, promotes cGMP signalling, and reverses the structural and haemodynamic deficits that characterize PAH. Herein, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of repurposing the neprilysin inhibitor, racecadotril, in PAH. Experimental Approach: Twenty-one PAH patients stable on PDE5i therapy were recruited. Acute haemodynamic and biochemical changes following a single dose of racecadotril or matching placebo were determined; this was followed by a 14-day safety and efficacy evaluation. The primary endpoint in both steps was the maximum change in circulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration (\u0394 max ), with secondary outcomes including pulmonary and systemic haemodynamics plus mechanistic biomarkers. Key Results: Acute administration of racecadotril (100 mg) resulted in a 79% increase in the plasma ANP concentration and a 106% increase in plasma cGMP levels, with a concomitant 14% fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. Racecadotril (100 mg; t.i.d.) treatment for 14 days resulted in a 19% rise in plasma ANP concentration. Neither acute nor chronic administration of racecadotril resulted in a significant drop in mean arterial BP or any serious adverse effects. Conclusions and Implications: This Phase IIa evaluation provides proof-of-principle evidence that neprilysin inhibitors may have therapeutic utility in PAH and warrants a larger scale prospective trial.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neprilysin", "Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063625557", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"7006811953": {"Name": "Hobbs A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006811953", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "54882341600": {"Name": "Moyes A.J.", "AuthorID": "54882341600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7006521133": {"Name": "Baliga R.S.", "AuthorID": "7006521133", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57208024876": {"Name": "Ghedia D.", "AuthorID": "57208024876", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194545979": {"Name": "Ochiel R.", "AuthorID": "57194545979", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57208029842": {"Name": "Smit A.", "AuthorID": "57208029842", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36106322600": {"Name": "Schreiber B.E.", "AuthorID": "36106322600", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23666861000": {"Name": "Coghlan G.J.", "AuthorID": "23666861000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55243107100": {"Name": "Sylvestre Y.", "AuthorID": "55243107100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "16941587100": {"Name": "Dor\u00e9 C.J.", "AuthorID": "16941587100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "55927692800": {"Name": "Chowdhury K.", "AuthorID": "55927692800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "14825405500": {"Name": "Maclagan K.", "AuthorID": "14825405500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "57208031377": {"Name": "Quartly H.L.", "AuthorID": "57208031377", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "6602595538": {"Name": "Sofat R.", "AuthorID": "6602595538", "AffiliationID": "124983659", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology, Rayne Institute"}, "57204577870": {"Name": "MacAllister R.J.", "AuthorID": "57204577870", "AffiliationID": "60006365", "AffiliationName": "Dorset County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
