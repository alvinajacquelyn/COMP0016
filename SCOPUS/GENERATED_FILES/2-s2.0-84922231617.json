A mixed integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) model is developed to achieve continuous bed height values. In addition, to ease the computational expense of the literature MILFP model for discrete bed height values, two efficient hierarchical solution approaches are developed involving the two MILFP models, in which, based on its optimal solution of the newly developed MILFP model, the reduced MILFP model is solved with smaller decision region to find the final solution. A Dinkelbach-based algorithm is used as the solution approach of the MILFP models. Finally, a case study with different upstream processing (USP) and downstream processing (DSP) ratios are investigated, and the results show that all proposed approaches have high computational efficiency to satisfy different needs of the decision makers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chromatography", "Downstream processing", "Hierarchical approach", "MAb", "MILFP"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational expense", "Downstream-processing", "Hierarchical approach", "MAb", "Manufacturing process", "MILFP", "Mixed integer linear", "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922231617", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"25628253900": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "25628253900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6507461481": {"Name": "Simaria A.S.", "AuthorID": "6507461481", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005343335": {"Name": "Farid S.S.", "AuthorID": "7005343335", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
