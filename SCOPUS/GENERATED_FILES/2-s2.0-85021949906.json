Blood samples were collected in 1989-1990 (Nurses' Health Study) and 2000-2002 (ESTHER). LTL was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We calculated z scores for LTL to standardize LTL measurements across the cohorts. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate relative mortality according to continuous levels and quintiles of LTL z scores. The hazard ratios obtained from each cohort were subsequently pooled by meta-analysis. Overall, 2,882 deaths were recorded during follow-up (Nurses' Health Study, 1989-2010; ESTHER, 2000-2015). LTL was inversely associated with age in both cohorts. After adjustment for age, a significant inverse trend of LTL with all-cause mortality was observed in both cohorts. In random-effects meta-analysis, age-adjusted hazard ratios for the shortest LTL quintile compared with the longest were 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04, 1.46) for all-cause mortality, 1.29 (95% CI: 0.83, 2.00) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1.10 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.37) for cancer mortality. In this study population with an age range of 43-75 years, we corroborated previous evidence suggesting that LTL predicts all-cause mortality beyond its association with age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aging", "all-cause mortality", "cancer mortality", "cardiovascular disease mortality", "cohort studies", "leukocytes", "telomere length"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Leukocytes", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Prospective Studies", "Telomere", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021949906", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"11940097400": {"Name": "Mons U.", "AuthorID": "11940097400", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer ResearchCenter (DKFZ)"}, "55577220200": {"Name": "M\u00fcezzinler A.", "AuthorID": "55577220200", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Network Aging Research, University of Heidelberg"}, "37665918200": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ttker B.", "AuthorID": "37665918200", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Network Aging Research, University of Heidelberg"}, "57194781271": {"Name": "Dieffenbach A.", "AuthorID": "57194781271", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer ResearchCenter (DKFZ)"}, "57201387616": {"Name": "Butterbach K.", "AuthorID": "57201387616", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Epidemiology and Aging Research, German Cancer ResearchCenter (DKFZ)"}, "7201832825": {"Name": "Brenner H.", "AuthorID": "7201832825", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, Medical School, University of Athens"}, "7006398580": {"Name": "Schick M.", "AuthorID": "7006398580", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "German Cancer Consortium"}, "8681509900": {"Name": "Peasey A.", "AuthorID": "8681509900", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Genomics and Proteomics Core Facility, German Cancer Research Center"}, "7003341293": {"Name": "De Vivo I.", "AuthorID": "7003341293", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Faculty of Population Health Sciences, University College London"}, "56448218100": {"Name": "Trichopoulou A.", "AuthorID": "56448218100", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60010869, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Channing Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7102621930": {"Name": "Boffetta P.", "AuthorID": "7102621930", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Translational Epidemiology, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}}}
