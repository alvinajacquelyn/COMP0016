MR spectroscopy and PET allow assessing in vivo the molecular and metabolic mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. This article focuses on the relationship between these imaging techniques and the biologic and chemical pathways leading to multiple sclerosis pathology and its clinical features. Future directions of research are also presented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metabolic", "Molecular", "MR imaging", "Multiple sclerosis", "PET", "Spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Positron-Emission Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017263838", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36461391900": {"Name": "Moccia M.", "AuthorID": "36461391900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "MS Clinical Care and Research Centre, Department of Neuroscience, Federico II University"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals, Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
