Overall pretherapy mean internal consistency (alpha) across clients was .80, and within-client alphas averaged .77; clients typically had 1 or 2 items that did not vary with the other items. Analyses of temporal structure indicated high levels of between-clients variance (58%), moderate pretherapy test-retest correlation (r = .57), and high session-to-session Lag-1 autocorrelation (82). Scores on the PQ provided clear evidence of convergence with a range of outcome measures (within-client r = .41). Mean pre-post effects were large (d = 1.25). The results support a revised caseness cutoff of 3.25 and a reliable change index interval of 1.67. We conclude that PQ data meet criteria for evidence-based, norm-referenced measurement of client psychological distress for supporting psychotherapy practice and research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Individualized", "Measurement", "Outcome", "Psychometrics", "Psychotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Portugal", "Psychometrics", "Psychotherapy", "Reproducibility of Results", "Scotland", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930915528", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7402639832": {"Name": "Elliott R.", "AuthorID": "7402639832", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Science and Health, University of Strathclyde"}, "55456620000": {"Name": "Wagner J.", "AuthorID": "55456620000", "AffiliationID": "114813312", "AffiliationName": "Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Centre of Vancouver"}, "35339793400": {"Name": "Sales C.", "AuthorID": "35339793400", "AffiliationID": "60028300, 60029257", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Educa\u00e7\u00e3o e Psicologia, Universidade de \u00c9vora, Centro de Investigacao e Intervencao Social, ISCTE - Instituto Universitario de Lisboa"}, "54884521300": {"Name": "Rodgers B.", "AuthorID": "54884521300", "AffiliationID": "60023760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychotherapy and Counselling, Auckland University of Technology"}, "55226085300": {"Name": "Alves P.", "AuthorID": "55226085300", "AffiliationID": "60028300", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o e Interven\u00e7\u00e3o Social, ISCTE - Instituto Universit\u00e1rio de Lisboa"}, "56680998100": {"Name": "Caf\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "56680998100", "AffiliationID": "115967444", "AffiliationName": "Portuguese Association of Family and Community Therapy"}}}
