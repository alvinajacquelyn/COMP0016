The release profiles of five of these commercial formulations were evaluated in bicarbonate buffer using a novel dissolution model that mimics the dynamic conditions of the gastrointestinal tract. Monolithic and multi-particulate mesalazine formulations with pH-dependent and/or independent release mechanisms were evaluated (Asacol\u00ae 800, Octasa\u00ae, Mezavant\u00ae XL, Salofalk\u00ae, Pentasa\u00ae), and each of the products displayed a distinctive dissolution profile. The dissolution results for Mezavant\u00ae XL (Lialda\u00ae) (lag time 290 min) demonstrated good correlation with previously reported in vivo disintegration times assessed by gamma-scintigraphy in humans. Octasa\u00ae showed a similar lag time to Mezavant\u00ae XL. Drug release from Asacol\u00ae 800 (Asacol\u00ae HD) showed a wide standard deviation, reflecting the great variability in vivo. Salofalk\u00ae displayed both delayed release and extended release characteristics. Pentasa\u00ae released more than 50% of its drug load in the stomach compartment of the model, which is attributed to the absence of a gastro-resistant coating in this product. The new dissolution method provided a realistic and discriminative in vitro assessment of mesalazine release from different formulations. These results demonstrate that this strategy can be used to predict intestinal release behaviour, and potentially aid the rational design of products developed to target different sites of the gut.", "AuthorKeywords": ["5-Aminosalicylic acid", "5-ASA", "Biorelevant dissolution", "Colonic delivery", "Enteric coatings", "Physiological bicarbonate buffers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Drug Liberation", "Gastrointestinal Tract", "Humans", "Mesalamine", "Solubility"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923637404", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"37037477300": {"Name": "Goyanes A.", "AuthorID": "37037477300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "55580943400": {"Name": "Hatton G.B.", "AuthorID": "55580943400", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "14834371000": {"Name": "Merchant H.A.", "AuthorID": "14834371000", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, School of Applied Sciences, University of Huddersfield"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.W.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Intract Pharma, Brunswick Square"}}}
