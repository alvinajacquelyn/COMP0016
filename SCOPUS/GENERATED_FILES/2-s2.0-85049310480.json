The aims of the present studies were to examine whether experimentally manipulating the psychosocial experience of feeling overweight impacted on snack food consumption and to identify mechanisms explaining this effect. In Study 1, to manipulate the psychosocial experience of feeling overweight, 120 women wore an obese body suit or control clothing in public or private settings, before consuming snack foods. Wearing the obese body suit resulted in an increase in snack food consumption and this effect was not moderated by whether participants wore the obese body suit in public or in private. In Study 2, we aimed to replicate the effect of the obese body suit on snack food consumption and also examined whether the effect of the body suit on eating behaviour was moderated by participant sex (n = 150; 80 women). Women who wore the obese body suit ate significantly more than women who wore the control clothing, but this effect was not observed in men. Across both studies we examined a number of potential mechanisms that could explain the effect that wearing the obese body suit had on snack food consumption, but did not find supporting evidence. The psychosocial experience of feeling overweight may lead to increased snack food consumption in women, but the psychological mechanism explaining this effect is unclear.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eating behaviour", "Obesity", "Weight perception", "Weight stigma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Eating", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Hyperphagia", "Male", "Obesity", "Overweight", "Self Concept", "Sex Factors", "Snacks", "Social Identification", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049310480", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"57069741800": {"Name": "Oldham M.", "AuthorID": "57069741800", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "55743428300": {"Name": "Robinson E.", "AuthorID": "55743428300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Sciences, University of Liverpool"}, "57203081511": {"Name": "Tomiyama A.J.", "AuthorID": "57203081511", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of California Los Angeles"}}}
