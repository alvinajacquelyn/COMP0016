The objective of this study is to identify the changes of metabolites in the rat endometriosis models treated with Gui-Zhi-Fu-Ling-capsules (GZFLC), a classic Chinese medicinal formula, and to explore the effects of GZFLC on the serum levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and the mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) in the endometriotic tissues. Forty female Wistar rats were randomly divided into the sham-operation group (Normal group), Model group, Danazol group, and GZFLC group. The serum levels of TGF-\u03b21 were measured using enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression levels of VEGF and GLUT-4 in the endometriotic tissue of the rat endometriosis models were measured using real-time quantitative PCR. The metabolites in urine were detected by 1 H NMR method. Eight identified metabolites of the NMR resonance were involved in the glycolysis metabolism. Among the 8 metabolites, Lactate, Acetate, TMA, and Formate were downregulated with GZFLC. Citrate, TMAO, Taurine, and Hippurate were unregulated with GZFLC. The serum levels of TGF-\u03b21 in the Danazol and GZFLC groups were significantly higher than those of Normal group and significantly lower than the Model group. GZFLC treatment significantly decreased the GLUT-4 and VEGF mRNA expression levels in the endometriotic tissues of the endometriosis rats (P < 0.05). GZFLC significantly decreased the GLUT-4 mRNA expression levels in rats of GZFLC group compared with Danazol group. It is through regulating the metabolites changes of glycolysis or gluconeogenesis that GZFLC significantly affected the expression levels of TGF-\u03b21, GLUT-4, and VEGF of the model rats with endometriosis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059459020", "SubjectAreas": [["Complementary and Alternative Medicine", "MEDI", "2707"]], "AuthorData": {"7405549870": {"Name": "Zhou J.", "AuthorID": "7405549870", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Medical School, University College London"}, "7004362582": {"Name": "Hardiman P.J.", "AuthorID": "7004362582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, Medical School, University College London"}, "56079575400": {"Name": "Ding Z.M.", "AuthorID": "56079575400", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University"}}}
