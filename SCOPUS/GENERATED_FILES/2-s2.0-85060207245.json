We describe an intuitionistic substructural logic called ILGL that gives an account of layering. The logic is a bunched system, combining the usual intuitionistic connectives, together with a non-commutative, non-associative conjunction (used to capture layering) and its associated implications. We give soundness and completeness theorems for a labelled tableaux system with respect to a Kripke semantics on graphs. We then give an equivalent relational semantics, itself proven equivalent to an algebraic semantics via a representation theorem. We utilise this result in two ways. First, we prove decidability of the logic by showing the finite embeddability property holds for the algebraic semantics. Second, we prove a Stone-type duality theorem for the logic. By introducing the notions of ILGL hyperdoctrine and indexed layered frame we are able to extend this result to a predicate version of the logic and prove soundness and completeness theorems for an extension of the layered graph semantics. We indicate the utility of predicate ILGL with a resource-labelled bigraph model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Algebraic semantics", "Bigraphs", "Bunched logic", "Complex systems", "Decidability", "Finite model property", "Graphs", "Hyperdoctrine", "Kripke semantics", "Layered graph logic", "Layered graphs", "Modelling", "Pointer logic", "Predicate logic", "Soundness and completeness", "Stone-type duality", "Substructural logic", "Tableaux"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algebraic semantic", "Bigraphs", "Bunched logic", "Finite model property", "Graphs", "Hyperdoctrine", "Kripke semantics", "Layered graphs", "Pointer logic", "Predicate logic", "Soundness and completeness", "Stone-type duality", "Substructural logic", "Tableaux"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": null, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060207245", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57190032258": {"Name": "Docherty S.", "AuthorID": "57190032258", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57207511534": {"Name": "Pym D.", "AuthorID": "57207511534", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
