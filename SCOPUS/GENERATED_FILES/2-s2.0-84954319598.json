In the article, they consider a Fred Astaire dance sequence from the 1953 Vincente Minnelli film, The Band Wagon, in combination with a remarkable article about this same sequence by Stanley Cavell. On the strength of this, they develop an interesting line of thought regarding the experience of language, exploring connections between the ideas of Cavell and Agamben. Rich and thought-provoking though their discussion is, I find that it deflects attention from the most important aspects of the film sequence and the literature that has developed in response \u2013 specifically regarding questions of race and praise. The present discussion attempts to address these matters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["appropriation", "Cavell", "experience", "praise", "race"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954319598", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"6701545310": {"Name": "Standish P.", "AuthorID": "6701545310", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
