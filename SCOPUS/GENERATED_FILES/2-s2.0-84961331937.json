Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.The structure and function of the \u03b3-secretase proteases are of great interest because of their crucial roles in cellular and disease processes. We established a novel purification protocol for the \u03b3-secretase complex that involves a conformation- and complexspecific nanobody, yielding highly pure and active enzyme. Using single particle electron microscopy, we analyzed the \u03b3-secretase structure and its conformational variability. Under steady-state conditions, the complex adopts three major conformations, which differ in overall compactness and relative position of the nicastrin ectodomain. Occupancy of the active or substrate-binding sites by inhibitors differentially stabilizes subpopulations of particles with compact conformations, whereas a mutation linked to familial Alzheimer disease results in enrichment of extended-conformation complexes with increased flexibility. Our study presents the \u03b3-secretase complex as a dynamic population of interconverting conformations, involving rearrangements at the nanometer scale and a high level of structural interdependence between subunits. The fact that protease inhibition or clinical mutations, which affect amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) generation, enrich for particular subpopulations of conformers indicates the functional relevance of the observed dynamic changes, which are likely to be instrumental for highly allosteric behavior of the enzyme.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Conformational landscape", "Regulated intramembrane proteolysis", "Single particle electron microscopy", "\u03b3-secretase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases", "Animals", "Catalytic Domain", "Cell Line", "Flavin-Adenine Dinucleotide", "HEK293 Cells", "Humans", "Insects", "Membrane Glycoproteins", "Microscopy, Electron", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Subunits"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961331937", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"16244424000": {"Name": "Elad N.", "AuthorID": "16244424000", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven and oDepartment of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven Research Institute for Neuroscience and Disease (LIND)"}, "7006241978": {"Name": "de Strooper B.", "AuthorID": "7006241978", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "55179347000": {"Name": "Lismont S.", "AuthorID": "55179347000", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven and oDepartment of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven Research Institute for Neuroscience and Disease (LIND)"}, "57188518800": {"Name": "Veugelen S.", "AuthorID": "57188518800", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven and oDepartment of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven Research Institute for Neuroscience and Disease (LIND)"}, "6505550080": {"Name": "Horr\u00e9 K.", "AuthorID": "6505550080", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven and oDepartment of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven Research Institute for Neuroscience and Disease (LIND)"}, "6505758892": {"Name": "Ch\u00e1vez-Guti\u00e9rrez L.", "AuthorID": "6505758892", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center of Human Genetics, University Hospitals Leuven and oDepartment of Human Genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven Research Institute for Neuroscience and Disease (LIND)"}, "55781805600": {"Name": "Hagen W.", "AuthorID": "55781805600", "AffiliationID": "60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Structural and Computational Biology Unit"}, "6701387296": {"Name": "Berezovska O.", "AuthorID": "6701387296", "AffiliationID": "60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Structural and Computational Biology Unit"}, "17343087600": {"Name": "Sachse C.", "AuthorID": "17343087600", "AffiliationID": "60008380", "AffiliationName": "European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Structural and Computational Biology Unit"}, "8531436000": {"Name": "Arimon M.", "AuthorID": "8531436000", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
