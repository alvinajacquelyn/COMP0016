We have previously described early alterations in synaptic transmission and plasticity in both the cortex and hippocampus of the R6/1 mouse model of Huntington\u2019s disease. Deficits in cortical synaptic plasticity were associated with altered dopaminergic signalling and could be reversed by D1- or D2-like dopamine receptor activation. In light of these findings we here investigated whether defects in dopamine signalling could also contribute to the marked alteration in hippocampal synaptic function. To this end we performed dopamine receptor labelling and pharmacology in the R6/1 hippocampus and report a marked, age-dependent elevation of hippocampal D1 and D2 receptor labelling in R6/1 hippocampal subfields. Yet, pharmacological inhibition or activation of D1- or D2-like receptors did not modify the aberrant synaptic plasticity observed in R6/1 mice. These findings demonstrate that global perturbations to dopamine receptor expression do occur in HD transgenic mice, similarly in HD gene carriers and patients. However, the direction of change and the lack of effect of dopaminergic pharmacological agents on synaptic function demonstrate that the perturbations are heterogeneous and region-specific, a finding that may explain the mixed results of dopamine therapy in HD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrophysiology", "Huntingtin", "LTD", "Neurodegeneration", "Polyglutamine", "R6/1", "Synaptic plasticity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dopamine", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Huntingtin Protein", "Huntington Disease", "Long-Term Synaptic Depression", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Receptors, Dopamine D1", "Receptors, Dopamine D2", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958257758", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"8583600800": {"Name": "Dall\u00e9rac G.M.", "AuthorID": "8583600800", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "CIRB, CNRS UMR 7241, INSERM U1050, Coll\u00e8ge de France"}, "7102877183": {"Name": "Cummings D.M.", "AuthorID": "7102877183", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology"}, "7102177277": {"Name": "Hirst M.C.", "AuthorID": "7102177277", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Research Forum, Department of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, The Open University"}, "14018533400": {"Name": "Milnerwood A.J.", "AuthorID": "14018533400", "AffiliationID": "60083635, 60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology & Centre for Applied Neurogenetics, Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, University of British Columbia"}, "16073557300": {"Name": "Murphy K.P.S.J.", "AuthorID": "16073557300", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Huntington\u2019s Disease Research Forum, Department of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences, The Open University"}}}
