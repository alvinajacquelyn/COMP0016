This study examines the extent of blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation of bumetanide, a key determinant of the efficacy of centrally acting drugs. Furthermore, the impact of efflux transporter organic anion transporter 3 (oat3) inhibition on bumetanide pharmacokinetics was investigated. Methods Bumetanide levels in extracellular fluid (ECF) and plasma in the presence and absence of oat3 inhibitor probenecid were monitored using integrated microdialysis. Key findings Following a bumetanide bolus/continuous infusion of 10 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg/h, bumetanide was detected in hippocampal ECF at the estimated concentration of 131 \u00b1 55 ng/ml. Plasma bumetanide levels were \u223c20 mg/l at steady state. Coadministration of probenecid resulted in an increase in bumetanide levels in both ECF and plasma, indicating that oat3 inhibition influences the pharmacokinetics of bumetanide primarily in the periphery. Conclusion Although bumetanide reached detectable levels in hippocampal ECF, bumetanide concentration in ECF was low relative to systemic concentration. Oat3 inhibition by probenecid resulted in increased bumetanide concentrations in brain and plasma. As an acute treatment in neonatal seizures, the bumetanide/probenecid combination may hold therapeutic potential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biopharmaceutics and drug disposition", "drug delivery to specific tissues", "drug disposition in tissues and whole animals", "pharmaceutics and drug delivery", "pharmacokinetics and drug disposition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic", "Animals", "Biological Transport", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Bumetanide", "Drug Interactions", "Extracellular Fluid", "GABA Agents", "Hippocampus", "Male", "Microdialysis", "Organic Anion Transporters", "Probenecid", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925699316", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"55971997200": {"Name": "Donovan M.D.", "AuthorID": "55971997200", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neuroscience, University College Cork"}, "54784955500": {"Name": "O'Brien F.E.", "AuthorID": "54784955500", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "14030252400": {"Name": "Griffin B.T.", "AuthorID": "14030252400", "AffiliationID": "60025160", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacodelivery Group, School of Pharmacy, University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.B.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60010410, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research, Cork University Maternity Hospital, University College Cork"}, "7003307517": {"Name": "Cryan J.F.", "AuthorID": "7003307517", "AffiliationID": "60005857, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Alimentary Pharmabiotic Centre, University College Cork"}}}
