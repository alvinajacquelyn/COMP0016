The molecular mechanisms by which these processes take place, however, remain largely unknown, in particular in the case of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). To address this question, we studied at a residue-specific level the structure and dynamics of ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), an IDP associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Using solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we find that, although the nascent chain (NC) has a highlydisordered conformation, its N-terminal region shows resonance broadening consistent with interactions involving specific regions of the ribosome surface.We also investigated the effects of the ribosomeassociated molecular chaperone trigger factor (TF) on \u03b1Syn structure and dynamics using resonance broadening to define a footprint of the TF-RNC interactions. We have used these data to construct structural models that suggest specific ways by which emerging NCs can interact with the biosynthesis and quality control machinery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cotranslational folding", "Nascent chain", "NMR spectroscopy", "Ribosome", "\u03b1-synuclein"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha-Synuclein", "Binding Sites", "Computer Simulation", "Models, Chemical", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Domains", "Ribosomes", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84970996447", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57189443639": {"Name": "Deckert A.", "AuthorID": "57189443639", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "28667456400": {"Name": "Waudby C.A.", "AuthorID": "28667456400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "35270487200": {"Name": "Wlodarski T.", "AuthorID": "35270487200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57142383400": {"Name": "Wentink A.S.", "AuthorID": "57142383400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57141890400": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57141890400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "26655792800": {"Name": "Kirkpatrick J.P.", "AuthorID": "26655792800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57187798800": {"Name": "Paton J.F.S.", "AuthorID": "57187798800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "6602803998": {"Name": "Cabrita L.D.", "AuthorID": "6602803998", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "55919826700": {"Name": "Christodoulou J.", "AuthorID": "55919826700", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "22133874500": {"Name": "Camilloni C.", "AuthorID": "22133874500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "35739000100": {"Name": "Kukic P.", "AuthorID": "35739000100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56623994700": {"Name": "Dobson C.M.", "AuthorID": "56623994700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7007094071": {"Name": "Vendruscolo M.", "AuthorID": "7007094071", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}}}
