We hypothesized that neutrophils may exacerbate neuronal injury through the release of neurotoxic quantities of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Methods: Real-time glutamate release by primary human neutrophils was determined using enzymatic biosensors. Bacterial and direct protein-kinase C (Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PMA) activation of neutrophils in human whole blood, isolated neutrophils or human cell lines were compared in the presence/absence of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonists. Bacterial and direct activation of neutrophils from wild-type and transgenic murine neutrophils deficient in NMDAR-scaffolding proteins were compared using flow cytometry (phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation) and real-time respirometry (oxygen consumption). Findings: Both glutamate and the NMDAR co-agonist D-serine are rapidly released by neutrophils in response to bacterial and PMA-induced activation. Pharmacological NMDAR blockade reduced both the autocrine release of glutamate, D-serine and the respiratory burst by activated primary human neutrophils. A highly specific small-molecule inhibitor ZL006 that limits NMDAR-mediated neuronal injury also reduced ROS by activated neutrophils in a murine model of peritonitis, via uncoupling of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit from its' scaffolding protein, postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95). Genetic ablation of PSD-95 reduced ROS production by activated murine neutrophils. Pharmacological blockade of the NMDAR GluN2B subunit reduced primary human neutrophil activation induced by Pseudomonas fluorescens, a glutamate-secreting Gram-negative bacillus closely related to pathogens that cause hospital-acquired infections. Interpretation: These data suggest that release of glutamate by activated neutrophils augments ROS production in an autocrine manner via actions on NMDAR expressed by these cells.
