Storey 2016.Policy reforms and calls for the need to link university ends with national economic priorities in government reports of the 1990s\u20132000s provided a context for the subsequent proliferation of professional doctorates in New Zealand and Australia. In these two countries with a unique context of close geographical, economic, and sociopolitical ties, the professional doctorates in psychology and medicine have taken different forms in the development process (Zurn & Dumont, 2008). Given such a transnational context, it is argued that a cross-country case study methodology seeking to identify the characteristics of these professional doctorates will add a new dimension to scholarship in this subject. The findings of this study can be used as a platform for enquiry or discussion about other countries that have similar sociopolitical or geographical ties and health professional regulation mechanisms as is the case between Canada and the United States.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Entry requirement", "Health workforce", "None none", "Nurse practitioner role", "Professional doctorate"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066292605", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55755710300": {"Name": "Mpofu C.", "AuthorID": "55755710300", "AffiliationID": "60023760", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, Auckland University of Technology"}}}
