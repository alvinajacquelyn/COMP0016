Published by Oxford University Press.Myoclonus-dystonia (M-D) is a very rare movement disorder, caused in ~30-50% of cases by mutations in SGCE. The CACNA1B variant c.4166G>A; (p. R1389H) was recently reported as the likely causative mutation in a single 3-generation Dutch pedigree with five subjects affected by a unique dominant M-D syndrome and cardiac arrhythmias. In an attempt to replicate this finding, we assessed by direct sequencing the frequency of CACNA1B c.4166G>A; (p. R1389H) in a cohort of 520 M-D cases, in which SGCE mutations had been previously excluded. A total of 146 cases (28%) had a positive family history of M-D. The frequency of the variant was also assessed in 489 neurologically healthy controls and in publicly available data sets of genetic variation (1000 Genomes, Exome Variant Server and Exome Aggregation Consortium). The variant was detected in a single sporadic case with M-D, but in none of the 146 probands with familial M-D. Overall, the variant was present at comparable frequencies in M-D cases (1 out of 520; 0.19%) and healthy controls (1 out of 489; 0.2%). A similar frequency of the variant was also reported in all publicly available databases. These results do not support a causal association between the CACNA1B c.4166G>A; (p. R1389H) variant and M-D.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alleles", "Amino Acid Substitution", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Codon", "Cohort Studies", "Dystonic Disorders", "Europe", "Exome", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genotype", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940661162", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"35176436700": {"Name": "Mencacci N.", "AuthorID": "35176436700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56815097200": {"Name": "R'bibo L.", "AuthorID": "56815097200", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56586205000": {"Name": "Bandres-Ciga S.", "AuthorID": "56586205000", "AffiliationID": "60027844", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Institute of Neurosciences Federico-Ol\u00f3riz, Centro de Investigaciones Biomedicas (CIBM), University of Granada"}, "57196045273": {"Name": "Pittman A.", "AuthorID": "57196045273", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202960784": {"Name": "Wood N.", "AuthorID": "7202960784", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "26423486500": {"Name": "Carecchio M.", "AuthorID": "26423486500", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta"}, "6603821807": {"Name": "Zorzi G.", "AuthorID": "6603821807", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Neuropediatrics Unit, IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta"}, "7003319824": {"Name": "Nardocci N.", "AuthorID": "7003319824", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Neuropediatrics Unit, IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta"}, "7004612048": {"Name": "Garavaglia B.", "AuthorID": "7004612048", "AffiliationID": "60017275", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Neurogenetics Unit, IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta"}, "36450181000": {"Name": "Batla A.", "AuthorID": "36450181000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "37027560500": {"Name": "Weissbach A.", "AuthorID": "37027560500", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurogenetics, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "26642933500": {"Name": "Klein C.", "AuthorID": "26642933500", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurogenetics, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "35519668300": {"Name": "Gasser T.", "AuthorID": "35519668300", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of T\u00fcbingen, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "7004826235": {"Name": "Lohmann E.", "AuthorID": "7004826235", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of T\u00fcbingen, German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}}}
