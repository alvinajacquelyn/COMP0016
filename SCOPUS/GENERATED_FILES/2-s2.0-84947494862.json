To determine the distribution of the enzymes responsible for the production of GABA and acetylcholine in areas involved in autonomic control in the mouse brainstem, we used a transgenic mouse expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) neurones, combined with choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) immunohistochemistry. ChAT-immunoreactive (IR) and GAD67-GFP containing neurones were observed throughout the brainstem. A small number of cells contained both ChAT-IR and GAD67-GFP. Such double labelled cells were observed in the NTS (predominantly in the intermediate and central subnuclei), the area postrema, reticular formation and lateral paragigantocellular nucleus. All ChAT-IR neurones in the area postrema contained GAD67-GFP. Double labelled neurones were not observed in the dorsal vagal motor nucleus, nucleus ambiguus or hypoglossal nucleus. Double labelled ChAT-IR/GAD67-GFP cells in the NTS did not contain neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) immunoreactivity, whereas those in the reticular formation and lateral paragigantocellular nucleus did. The function of these small populations of double labelled cells is currently unknown, however their location suggests a potential role in integrating signals involved in oromotor behaviours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomic", "Brainstem", "ChAT", "GAD67", "NTS", "Reticular formation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Choline O-Acetyltransferase", "Gene Knock-In Techniques", "Glutamate Decarboxylase", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Immunohistochemistry", "Medulla Oblongata", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947494862", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56652132400": {"Name": "Gotts J.", "AuthorID": "56652132400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "7101964447": {"Name": "Atkinson L.", "AuthorID": "7101964447", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "12244740900": {"Name": "Edwards I.J.", "AuthorID": "12244740900", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "6701349510": {"Name": "Deuchars S.A.", "AuthorID": "6701349510", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "7004736633": {"Name": "Deuchars J.", "AuthorID": "7004736633", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds"}, "7102528056": {"Name": "Yanagawa Y.", "AuthorID": "7102528056", "AffiliationID": "60162044", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetic and Behavioural Neuroscience, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine"}}}
