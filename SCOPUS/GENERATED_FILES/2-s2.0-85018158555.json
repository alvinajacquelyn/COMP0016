It is widely accepted that delirium is associated with dementia but the degree of causation within this relationship is unclear. Previous studies have been limited by incomplete ascertainment of baseline cognition or a lack of prospective delirium assessments. There is an urgent need for an improved understanding of the relationship between delirium and dementia given that delirium prevention may plausibly impact upon dementia prevention. A well-designed, observational study could also answer fundamental questions of major importance to patients and their families regarding outcomes after delirium. The Delirium and Cognitive Impact in Dementia (DECIDE) study aims to explore the association between delirium and cognitive function over time in older participants. In an existing population based cohort aged 65 years and older, the effect on cognition of an episode of delirium will be measured, independent of baseline cognition and illness severity. The predictive value of clinical parameters including delirium severity, baseline cognition and delirium subtype on cognitive outcomes following an episode of delirium will also be explored. Methods: Over a 12 month period, surviving participants from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study II-Newcastle will be screened for delirium on admission to hospital. At the point of presentation, baseline characteristics along with a number of disease relevant clinical parameters will be recorded. The progression/resolution of delirium will be monitored. In those with and without delirium, cognitive decline and dementia will be assessed at one year follow-up. We will evaluate the effect of delirium on cognitive function over time along with the predictive value of clinical parameters. Discussion: This study will be the first to prospectively elucidate the size of the effect of delirium upon cognitive decline and incident dementia. The results will be used to inform future dementia prevention trials that focus on delirium intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CFAS II", "Cognitive outcomes", "Cohort", "Delirium", "Dementia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Clinical Protocols", "Cognition", "Cognition Disorders", "Cohort Studies", "Delirium", "Dementia", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Patient Admission", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018158555", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57016133900": {"Name": "Richardson S.J.", "AuthorID": "57016133900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, 3rd floor Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle University Campus for Ageing and Vitality"}, "7401647155": {"Name": "Parker S.", "AuthorID": "7401647155", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, 3rd floor Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle University Campus for Ageing and Vitality"}, "57219322239": {"Name": "Allan L.M.", "AuthorID": "57219322239", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, 3rd floor Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle University Campus for Ageing and Vitality"}, "55350725000": {"Name": "Davis D.H.J.", "AuthorID": "55350725000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "22136848800": {"Name": "Stephan B.", "AuthorID": "22136848800", "AffiliationID": "60159968", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ageing, 2nd floor Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle University Campus for Ageing and Vitality"}, "16835708800": {"Name": "Robinson L.", "AuthorID": "16835708800", "AffiliationID": "60159968", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ageing, 2nd floor Biomedical Research Building, Newcastle University Campus for Ageing and Vitality"}, "57210386759": {"Name": "Brayne C.", "AuthorID": "57210386759", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, Forvie Site, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "55898231200": {"Name": "Barnes L.", "AuthorID": "55898231200", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, Forvie Site, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
