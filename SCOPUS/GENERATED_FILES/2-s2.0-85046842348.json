All rights reserved.Recordings of alpha motoneuron discharges from branches of the intercostal and abdominal nerves in anesthetized cats were analyzed for modulation during the cardiac cycle. Cardiac modulation was assessed by the construction of cross-correlation histograms between the R-wave of the ECG and the largest amplitude efferent spikes. In all but two recordings (which were believed to have either no or few alpha spikes), the histograms showed relatively short duration peaks and/or troughs (widths at half amplitude 4\u201350 ms) at lags of 10\u2013150 ms. These observations were deduced to result from activity in oligosynaptic pathways, probably from muscle spindle afferents, whose discharges are known to be synchronized to the cardiac pulse. The results suggest that onward transmission of the cardiac signal from thoracic muscle afferents (and possibly from other dynamically sensitive afferents) to other parts of the central nervous system is highly likely and that therefore these afferents could contribute to cardiac interoception. NEW & NOTEWORTHY It has been recognized since 1933 that muscle spindles respond to the cardiac pulse, but it is unknown whether this cardiac signal is transmitted to other levels in the nervous system. Here we show that a cardiac signal, likely arising from muscle spindles, is present in the efferent activities of thoracic and abdominal muscle nerves, suggesting probable onward transmission of this signal to higher levels and therefore that muscle spindles could contribute to cardiac interoception.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac modulation", "Intercostal motoneurons", "Intercostal reflexes", "Interoception", "Thoracic spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdominal Muscles", "Animals", "Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena", "Cats", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Intercostal Muscles", "Intercostal Nerves", "Interoception", "Male", "Motor Neurons", "Muscle Spindles", "Spinal Cord", "Thoracic Vertebrae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046842348", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"7202760462": {"Name": "Ford T.", "AuthorID": "7202760462", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004323434": {"Name": "Kirkwood P.", "AuthorID": "7004323434", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
