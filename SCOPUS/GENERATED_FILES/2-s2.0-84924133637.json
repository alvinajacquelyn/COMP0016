All rights reserved.Carbohydrate-protein interactions can assist with the targeting of polymer- and nano-delivery systems. However, some potential protein targets are not specific to a single cell type, resulting in reductions in their efficacy due to undesirable non-specific cellular interactions. The glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) is expressed to different extents on most cells in the vasculature, including human red blood cells and on cancerous tissue. Glycosylated nanomaterials bearing glucose (or related) carbohydrates, therefore, could potentially undergo unwanted interactions with these transporters, which may compromise the nanomaterial function or lead to cell agglutination, for example. Here, RAFT polymerisation is employed to obtain well-defined glucose-functional glycopolymers as well as glycosylated gold nanoparticles. Agglutination and binding assays did not reveal any significant binding to ovine red blood cells, nor any haemolysis. These data suggest that gluco-functional nanomaterials are compatible with blood, and their lack of undesirable interactions highlights their potential for delivery and imaging applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biocompatibility", "Blood", "Glycobiology", "Glycopolymer", "Nanoparticle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbohydrate-protein interactions", "Cellular interaction", "Functional Nano materials", "Glucose transporter-1", "Glycobiology", "Glycopolymers", "Imaging applications", "Nano-delivery systems", "Agglutination", "Animals", "Biocompatible Materials", "Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic", "Erythrocytes", "Glucose", "Gold", "Hemolysis", "Humans", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Polymers", "Sheep"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924133637", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56452625800": {"Name": "Wilkins L.", "AuthorID": "56452625800", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}, "55016071800": {"Name": "Phillips D.", "AuthorID": "55016071800", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}, "55213540400": {"Name": "Deller R.", "AuthorID": "55213540400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}, "36811362900": {"Name": "Davies G.", "AuthorID": "36811362900", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}, "18634225400": {"Name": "Gibson M.", "AuthorID": "18634225400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}}}
