Detractors have pointed out the chronic lack of proper legislation. Unfortunately, there is little quantitative evidence about Airbnb\u2019s spatial penetration upon which to base such a legislation. In this study, we analyze Airbnb\u2019s spatial distribution in eight U.S. urban areas, in relation to both geographic, socio-demographic, and economic information. We find that, despite being very different in terms of population composition, size, and wealth, all eight cities exhibit the same pattern: that is, areas of high Airbnb presence are those occupied by the \u201ctalented and creative\u201d classes, and those that are close to city centers. This result is consistent so much so that the accuracy of predicting Airbnb\u2019s spatial penetration is as high as 0.725.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Airbnb", "Quantitative analysis", "Sharing economy", "Spatial data mining"], "IndexKeywords": ["Airbnb", "City centers", "Economic information", "Hospitality industry", "Sharing economy", "Sharing platforms", "Spatial data mining", "Urban areas"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053707598", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"55936820200": {"Name": "Quattrone G.", "AuthorID": "55936820200", "AffiliationID": "60014105", "AffiliationName": "Middlesex University"}, "57203941973": {"Name": "Greatorex A.", "AuthorID": "57203941973", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003753918": {"Name": "Capra L.", "AuthorID": "7003753918", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "9743656700": {"Name": "Musolesi M.", "AuthorID": "9743656700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14038000600": {"Name": "Quercia D.", "AuthorID": "14038000600", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}}}
