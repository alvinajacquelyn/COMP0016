The main complication in migraine is the chronicity of the process, now recognized as a chronic migraine. Although pathogenic mechanisms that may influence the pathophysiology of migraine and its possible chronicity are not fully understood, previous studies have shown in patients with migraine molecular alterations of systemic inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, innate immunity, dysfunction of matrix proteases and blood-brain barrier. Periodontal disease is an inflammatory lesion caused by bacteria. After the bacterial infection begins, an immune response that will be responsible for individual susceptibility appears. More advanced forms of periodontitis have demonstrated molecular alterations of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, dysfunction of matrix proteases and innate immunity, similar to those observed in migraine. Furthermore, the main molecular mediators of neurogenic inflammation related to activation of the trigeminovascular system, which are characteristic of migraine, are overexpressed in gingival crevicular fluid and mucosa in patients with periodontal disease. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, insulin resistance, stroke or coronary artery disease are comorbidities that periodontal disease and migraine could share. Therefore, several mechanisms and hypotheses could explain the possible association between both diseases. However, epidemiological and molecular studies will be necessary to provide a better understanding of this potential association, which could be implicated in the chronification of migraine.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronification", "Headache", "Hypothesis", "Inflammation", "Migraine", "Periodontal disease", "Risk factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Chronic Disease", "Disease Progression", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Migraine Disorders", "Models, Immunological", "Periodontal Diseases", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015768327", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57193676485": {"Name": "Ameijeira P.", "AuthorID": "57193676485", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "56707470700": {"Name": "Leira Y.", "AuthorID": "56707470700", "AffiliationID": "112993065", "AffiliationName": "Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "57061663300": {"Name": "Blanco J.", "AuthorID": "57061663300", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, School of Dentistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "7005680825": {"Name": "Leira R.", "AuthorID": "7005680825", "AffiliationID": "60002983, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Headache Unit, Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Hospital Cl\u00ednico Universitario, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS), University of Santiago de Compostela"}}}
