Clinical experience demonstrates that restoration of mucociliary clearance in the lungs after transplantation of tissue-engineered grafts is critical, with preclinical studies showing that seeding scaffolds with autologous mucosa improves regeneration. High epithelial cell-seeding densities are required in regenerative medicine, and existing techniques are inadequate to achieve coverage of clinically suitable grafts. Objectives: To define a scalable cell culture system to deliver airway epithelium to clinical grafts. Methods: Human respiratory epithelial cells derived from endobronchial biopsies were cultured using a combination of mitotically inactivated fibroblasts and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibition using Y-27632 (3T31Y). Cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry to assess airway stem cell marker expression. Karyotyping and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification were performed to assess cell safety. Differentiation capacity was tested in three-dimensional tracheospheres, organotypic cultures, air-liquid interface cultures, and an in vivo tracheal xenograft model. Ciliary function was assessed in air-liquid interface cultures. Measurements and Main Results: 3T3-J2 feeder cells and ROCK inhibition allowed rapid expansion of airway basal cells. These cells were capable of multipotent differentiation in vitro, generating both ciliated and goblet cell lineages. Cilia were functional with normal beat frequency and pattern. Cultured cells repopulated tracheal scaffolds in a heterotopic transplantation xenograft model. Conclusions: Our method generates large numbers of functional airway basal epithelial cells with the efficiency demanded by clinical transplantation, suggesting its suitability for use in tracheal reconstruction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult stem cells", "Epithelium", "Respiratory mucosa", "Tissue engineering", "Trachea"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Differentiation", "Cells, Cultured", "Epithelial Cells", "Flow Cytometry", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Humans", "Mucociliary Clearance", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Respiratory Mucosa", "Respiratory Tract Diseases", "Stem Cells", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988938994", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"26421052200": {"Name": "Butler C.R.", "AuthorID": "26421052200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "55503347900": {"Name": "Hynds R.E.", "AuthorID": "55503347900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "54383218900": {"Name": "Gowers K.H.C.", "AuthorID": "54383218900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "55547124471": {"Name": "Brown J.M.", "AuthorID": "55547124471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "7006129349": {"Name": "Teixeira V.H.", "AuthorID": "7006129349", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56284267000": {"Name": "Hamilton N.J.", "AuthorID": "56284267000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "57189848085": {"Name": "Thakrar R.M.", "AuthorID": "57189848085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "6603125693": {"Name": "Giangreco A.", "AuthorID": "6603125693", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Thoracic Medicine, University College London Hospitals"}, "57191347362": {"Name": "Lee D.D.H.", "AuthorID": "57191347362", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Critical Care, and Anesthesia, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "26664945800": {"Name": "Smith C.M.", "AuthorID": "26664945800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Critical Care, and Anesthesia, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "35599642600": {"Name": "O'Callaghan C.", "AuthorID": "35599642600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory Critical Care, and Anesthesia, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "54392763900": {"Name": "Crowley C.", "AuthorID": "54392763900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "35076756500": {"Name": "Urbani L.", "AuthorID": "35076756500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57203257829": {"Name": "De Coppi P.", "AuthorID": "57203257829", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Regenerative Medicine Section, Great Ormond Street Hospital, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56262857700": {"Name": "Booth H.L.", "AuthorID": "56262857700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Thoracic Medicine, University College London Hospitals"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60029890, 60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital"}}}
