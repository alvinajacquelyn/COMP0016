In particular, the extraction of uranium(VI) from aqueous nitric acid solutions (3 M) into 30% v/v TBP/Exxsol D80, relevant to spent nuclear fuel reprocessing, was studied for different cell geometries, i.e. main chamber size (D = 2 and 3.2 mm) and jet diameter (dj = 0.25 and 0.5 mm), and different operating conditions, i.e. residence time (\u03c4 = 1\u20139 s), total jet velocity (utot = 2.6\u20138.6 m/s), and reactor length (L = 7\u201385 cm). For all conditions investigated, the aqueous phase was the dispersed one. Drop sizes were also measured with high-speed imaging. It was found that the extraction efficiency increased by increasing residence time for a constant total jet velocity regardless of the chamber size. At a constant residence time, higher extraction efficiency was achieved at high total jet velocities, which are associated with larger interfacial areas (smaller drops). The extraction efficiency reached 70% in most of the cases investigated in less than 2 s. In addition, high overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients (up to 1 s\u22121) were obtained at short residence times. Using regression analysis, a correlation for the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient was developed from the experimental data with an average deviation of 9%.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Confined impinging-jets", "Drop size", "Extraction", "Mass transfer coefficients", "Uranium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aqueous nitric acid", "Confined impinging jets", "Different operating conditions", "Drop size", "Extraction efficiencies", "Mass transfer performance", "Spent nuclear fuel reprocessing", "Volumetric mass transfer coefficient"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042457604", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55313686700": {"Name": "Tsaoulidis D.", "AuthorID": "55313686700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ThAMeS Multiphase, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202611731": {"Name": "Ortega E.G.", "AuthorID": "57202611731", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ThAMeS Multiphase, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ThAMeS Multiphase, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
