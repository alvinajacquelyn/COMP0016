Using multivariate and multilevel statistical analysis, we show that shrinkage in cities is associated with different urban functions, and demonstrate the territorial disparity of their influence. This sophisticated description of urban and regional attributes of shrinkage provides insights into the probable consequences of different demographic policies in tomorrow's Russia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multilevel", "Russia", "Shrinkage", "Shrinking city", "System of cities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994316528", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"54392627400": {"Name": "Cottineau C.", "AuthorID": "54392627400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London"}}}
