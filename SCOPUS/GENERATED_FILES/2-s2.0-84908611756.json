Our new melting curve, defined by a Simon-Glatzel fit to the data where TM(K)=[(PM/18.78\u00b110.20+1)]1/2.42\u00b10.66\u00d71726, is in good agreement with the majority of the theoretical studies on Ni melting and matches closely the available shock wave melting data. It is however dramatically steeper than the previous off-line LH-DAC studies in which determination of melting was based on the visual observation of motion aided by the laser speckle method. We estimate the melting point (TM) of Ni at the inner-core boundary (ICB) pressure of 330 GPa to be TM=5800\u00b1700 K (\u03c3), within error of the value for Fe of TM=6230\u00b1500 K determined in a recent in situ LH-DAC study by similar methods to those employed here. This similarity suggests that the alloying of 5-10 wt.% Ni with the Fe-rich core alloy is unlikely to have any significant effect on the temperature of the ICB, though this is dependent on the details of the topology of the Fe-Ni binary phase diagram at core pressures. Our melting temperature for Ni at 330 GPa is ~2500 K higher than that found in previous experimental studies employing the laser speckle method. We find that those earlier melting curves coincide with the onset of rapid sub-solidus recrystallization, suggesting that visual observations of motion may have misinterpreted dynamic recrystallization as convective motion of a melt. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the high-pressure melting behaviour of a number of other transition metals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["High-pressure", "Laser-heated diamond anvil cell", "Melting", "Nickel"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binary phase diagrams", "Convective motions", "High pressure", "High pressure melting", "In-situ X-ray diffraction", "Inner core boundary", "Laser-heated diamond anvil cells", "Visual observations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84908611756", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"24483373600": {"Name": "Lord O.T.", "AuthorID": "24483373600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7102583827": {"Name": "Wood I.G.", "AuthorID": "7102583827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7006319791": {"Name": "Dobson D.P.", "AuthorID": "7006319791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6603903752": {"Name": "Vo\u010dadlo L.", "AuthorID": "6603903752", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56203641200": {"Name": "Wann E.T.H.", "AuthorID": "56203641200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56404842900": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "56404842900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol, Wills Memorial Building"}, "12645627100": {"Name": "Thomson A.R.", "AuthorID": "12645627100", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol, Wills Memorial Building"}, "55675222635": {"Name": "Walter M.J.", "AuthorID": "55675222635", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth Sciences, University of Bristol, Wills Memorial Building"}, "55906740300": {"Name": "Morard G.", "AuthorID": "55906740300", "AffiliationID": "60157961, 60028993, 60028311, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie de Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie (IMPMC), Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s - UPMC Univ Paris 06, UMR CNRS 7590, Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle"}, "7003799217": {"Name": "Mezouar M.", "AuthorID": "7003799217", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}}}
