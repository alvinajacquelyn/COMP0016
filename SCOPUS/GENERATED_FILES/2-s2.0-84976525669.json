Yet, tools that provide this data are often challenged by high cell density and their accuracy is difficult to measure. Here, we present a three-step procedure to address this problem. Step one is a novel segmentation algorithm based on image derivatives that, in combination with selective post-processing, reliably and automatically segments cell nuclei from images of densely packed tissue. Step two is a quantitative validation using synthetic images to ascertain the efficiency of the algorithm with respect to signal- To-noise ratio and object density. Finally, we propose an original method to generate reliable and experimentally faithful ground truth datasets: Sparsedense dual-labeled embryo chimeras are used to unambiguously measure segmentation errors within experimental data. Together, the three steps outlined here establish a robust, iterative procedure to fine- Tune image analysis algorithms and microscopy settings associated with embryonic 3D image data sets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Cell Nucleus", "Chimerism", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976525669", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14832256100": {"Name": "Rajasekaran B.", "AuthorID": "14832256100", "AffiliationID": "60032834", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Physics of Complex Systems"}, "22952237200": {"Name": "Uriu K.", "AuthorID": "22952237200", "AffiliationID": "60024784", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University"}, "36786783700": {"Name": "Valentin G.", "AuthorID": "36786783700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Genoway"}, "23037272300": {"Name": "Tinevez J.", "AuthorID": "23037272300", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Institut Pasteur, Imagopole/CiTech"}, "7006526288": {"Name": "Oates A.", "AuthorID": "7006526288", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
