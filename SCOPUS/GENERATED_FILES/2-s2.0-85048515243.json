However, they fulfill opposite functions in dendritic spines, with CaMKII activity driving long-term synaptic potentiation following large influxes of Ca2+ through NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs), and calcineurin responding to smaller influxes of Ca2+ through the same receptors to induce long-term depression. In this review, we explore the notion that precise dynamic localisation of the two enzymes at different sites within dendritic spines is fundamental to this behaviour. We describe the structural basis of calcineurin and CaMKII localisation by their interaction with proteins including AKAP79, densin-180, \u03b1-actinin, and NMDARs. We then consider how interactions with these proteins likely position calcineurin and CaMKII at different distances from Ca2+ microdomains emanating from the mouths of NMDARs in order to drive the divergent responses. We also highlight shortcomings in our current understanding of synaptic localisation of these two important signalling enzymes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anchoring protein", "Calcineurin", "Calcium", "CaMKII", "Spine", "Synapse", "Synaptic plasticity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Calcineurin", "Calcium", "Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2", "Dendritic Spines", "Humans", "Long-Term Potentiation", "Protein Domains", "Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048515243", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56247209700": {"Name": "Penny C.", "AuthorID": "56247209700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London"}, "15048092700": {"Name": "Gold M.", "AuthorID": "15048092700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
