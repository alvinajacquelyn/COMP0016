These capabilities include transporting regulatory molecules including different RNA species, lipids, and proteins through the extracellular space including blood and delivering these cargos to recipient cells to modify cellular activity. EVs powerfully stimulate angiogenesis, and can protect the heart against myocardial infarction. They also appear to mediate some of the paracrine effects of cells, and have therefore been proposed as a potential alternative to cell-based regenerative therapies. Moreover, EVs of different sources may be useful biomarkers of cardiovascular disease identities. However, the methods used for the detection and isolation of EVs have several limitations and vary widely between studies, leading to uncertainties regarding the exact population of EVs studied and how to interpret the data. The number of publications in the exosome and MV field has been increasing exponentially in recent years and, therefore, in this ESC Working Group Position Paper, the overall objective is to provide a set of recommendations for the analysis and translational application of EVs focussing on the diagnosis and therapy of the ischaemic heart. This should help to ensure that the data from emerging studies are robust and repeatable, and optimize the pathway towards the diagnostic and therapeutic use of EVs in clinical studies for patient benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardioprotection", "Co-morbidities", "Exosomes", "Extracellular vesicles", "Heart failure", "Ischaemia", "Microvesicles", "Postconditioning", "Preconditioning", "Regenerative medicine", "Remote conditioning", "Reperfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Cardiology", "Cell Fractionation", "Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy", "Cell-Derived Microparticles", "Consensus", "Diagnostic Techniques, Cardiovascular", "Exosomes", "Humans", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Predictive Value of Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040573770", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"6602905237": {"Name": "Sluijter J.P.G.", "AuthorID": "6602905237", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Cardiology Laboratory, UMC Utrecht Regenerative Medicine Center, University Medical Center Utrecht, University Utrecht"}, "10139785100": {"Name": "Davidson S.M.", "AuthorID": "10139785100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London"}, "7006599024": {"Name": "Boulanger C.M.", "AuthorID": "7006599024", "AffiliationID": "60136279, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, Paris Cardiovascular Research Center"}, "7004693063": {"Name": "Buz\u00e1s E.I.", "AuthorID": "7004693063", "AffiliationID": "60027811", "AffiliationName": "MTA Immunoproteogenomics Research Group"}, "7003654548": {"Name": "De Kleijn D.P.V.", "AuthorID": "7003654548", "AffiliationID": "119051377", "AffiliationName": "Netherlands Heart Institute"}, "28767706900": {"Name": "Engel F.B.", "AuthorID": "28767706900", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Renal and Cardiovascular Research, Department of Nephropathology, Institute of Pathology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg"}, "6506196778": {"Name": "Giricz Z.", "AuthorID": "6506196778", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Semmelweis University"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.J.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7101918185": {"Name": "Kishore R.", "AuthorID": "7101918185", "AffiliationID": "60013936, 60030398", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Center for Translational Medicine, Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Temple University"}, "6602146006": {"Name": "Lecour S.", "AuthorID": "6602146006", "AffiliationID": "60010932, 60000356", "AffiliationName": "Hatter Institute for Cardiovascular Research in Africa, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Cape Town"}, "35430612500": {"Name": "Leor J.", "AuthorID": "35430612500", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Neufeld Cardiac Research Institute, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University"}, "6701374187": {"Name": "Madonna R.", "AuthorID": "6701374187", "AffiliationID": "60023304", "AffiliationName": "Texas Heart Institute"}, "35293528300": {"Name": "Perrino C.", "AuthorID": "35293528300", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, Federico II University"}, "55879612100": {"Name": "Prunier F.", "AuthorID": "55879612100", "AffiliationID": "60012772", "AffiliationName": "Institut Mitovasc, Universit\u00e9 d'Angers"}, "7102977056": {"Name": "Sahoo S.", "AuthorID": "7102977056", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Institute, Icahn School of Medicine"}, "6701798081": {"Name": "Schiffelers R.M.", "AuthorID": "6701798081", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory Clinical Chemistry and Hematology Division, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7402392670": {"Name": "Schulz R.", "AuthorID": "7402392670", "AffiliationID": "60017134", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology, Justus-Liebig University of Giessen"}, "9533995100": {"Name": "Van Laake L.W.", "AuthorID": "9533995100", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60031066", "AffiliationName": "Division Heart and Lungs, Hubrecht Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7003860273": {"Name": "Ytrehus K.", "AuthorID": "7003860273", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Research Group, Department of Medical Biology, Arctic University of Norway"}, "7006126478": {"Name": "Ferdinandy P.", "AuthorID": "7006126478", "AffiliationID": "60116252", "AffiliationName": "Pharmahungary Group"}}}
