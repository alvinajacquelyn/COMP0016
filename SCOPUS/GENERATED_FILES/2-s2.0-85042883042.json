This paper proposes a hybrid system that combines traditional backhaul-connected small base stations (SBSs) and cache-enabled SBSs to achieve the maximum area spectral efficiency (ASE) while saving backhaul consumption in mmWave small cell networks. We derive and compare the ASE results for both the traditional and hybrid networks, and also show that the optimal content placement to maximize ASE is to cache the most popular contents. Numerical results demonstrate the performance improvement of deploying cache-enabled SBSs. Furthermore, given a total caching capacity, it is revealed that there is a tradeoff between the cache-enabled SBSs density and individual cache size to maximize the ASE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["area spectral efficiency", "backhaul", "cache-enabled network", "Millimeter wave"], "IndexKeywords": ["Area spectral efficiencies", "backhaul", "Downlink", "Micro cell", "Millimeter-wave technology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042883042", "SubjectAreas": [["Automotive Engineering", "ENGI", "2203"], ["Aerospace Engineering", "ENGI", "2202"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56021641700": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "56021641700", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "16176882900": {"Name": "Zheng G.", "AuthorID": "16176882900", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "8587025300": {"Name": "Lambotharan S.", "AuthorID": "8587025300", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson School of Mechanical, Electrical and Manufacturing Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}}}
