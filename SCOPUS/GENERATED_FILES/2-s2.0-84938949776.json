A\u03b2 accumulation has been hypothesized to result from an imbalance between A\u03b2 production and clearance; indeed, A\u03b2 clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD. To develop efficient strategies to slow down or halt AD, it is critical to understand how A\u03b2 is cleared from the brain. Extracellular A\u03b2 deposits can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, most importantly, transport across the blood-brain barrier. Findings from the past few years suggest that astroglial-mediated interstitial fluid (ISF) bulk flow, known as the glymphatic system, might contribute to a larger portion of extracellular A\u03b2 (eA\u03b2) clearance than previously thought. The meningeal lymphatic vessels, discovered in 2015, might provide another clearance route. Because these clearance systems act together to drive eA\u03b2 from the brain, any alteration to their function could contribute to AD. An understanding of A\u03b2 clearance might provide strategies to reduce excess A\u03b2 deposits and delay, or even prevent, disease onset. In this Review, we describe the clearance systems of the brain as they relate to proteins implicated in AD pathology, with the main focus on A\u03b2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption, Physiological", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Brain", "Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins", "Extracellular Fluid", "Humans", "Lymphatic System", "Proteolysis", "Risk Factors", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938949776", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56731085000": {"Name": "Tarasoff-Conway J.M.", "AuthorID": "56731085000", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "23008075900": {"Name": "Fieremans E.", "AuthorID": "23008075900", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "7005506139": {"Name": "Axel L.", "AuthorID": "7005506139", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "7103319006": {"Name": "Nicholson C.", "AuthorID": "7103319006", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "23767970500": {"Name": "Carare R.O.", "AuthorID": "23767970500", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton, Faculty of Medicine, Institute for Life Sciences, Southampton General Hospital"}, "35091427400": {"Name": "Osorio R.S.", "AuthorID": "35091427400", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "57209647590": {"Name": "Glodzik L.", "AuthorID": "57209647590", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "36641522100": {"Name": "Butler T.", "AuthorID": "36641522100", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "7005170984": {"Name": "Rusinek H.", "AuthorID": "7005170984", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "35376125800": {"Name": "Frangione B.", "AuthorID": "35376125800", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "7005291375": {"Name": "Wisniewski T.", "AuthorID": "7005291375", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "7102467326": {"Name": "De Leon M.J.", "AuthorID": "7102467326", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "7005891585": {"Name": "Zlokovic B.V.", "AuthorID": "7005891585", "AffiliationID": "60015183", "AffiliationName": "Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "36042061700": {"Name": "M\u00e9nard J.", "AuthorID": "36042061700", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Descartes"}}}
