The core argument is that trade unions are subject to \u2018cost disease\u2019 pressures such that costs rise over the long term above the general level of inflation. They have this property because of the difficulty in solving first- and second-order collective action problems. First-order problems refer to the problems of initiating collective action and second-order problems refer to the management of collective action organizations. Both UK aggregate and case-study data \u2014 from one of the largest UK unions, Unite \u2014 are presented to illustrate the cost disease problem and to suggest options for its management. In conclusion, the wider implications of \u2018cost disease\u2019 pressures for unions are assessed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065477380", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"6603397255": {"Name": "Willman P.", "AuthorID": "6603397255", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7005546003": {"Name": "Bryson A.", "AuthorID": "7005546003", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57154476100": {"Name": "Forth J.", "AuthorID": "57154476100", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
