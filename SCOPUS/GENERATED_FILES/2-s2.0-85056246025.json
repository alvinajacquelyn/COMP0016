Mammalian in vitro experiments show that potentially cancerous cells undergo live apical extrusion from normal monolayers. However, the mechanism underlying this process in vivo remains poorly understood. Mosaic expression of the oncogene vSrc in a simple epithelium of the early zebrafish embryo results in extrusion of transformed cells. Here we find that during extrusion components of the cytokinetic ring are recruited to adherens junctions of transformed cells, forming a misoriented pseudo-cytokinetic ring. As the ring constricts, it separates the basal from the apical part of the cell releasing both from the epithelium. This process requires cell cycle progression and occurs immediately after vSrc-transformed cell enters mitosis. To achieve extrusion, vSrc coordinates cell cycle progression, junctional integrity, cell survival and apicobasal polarity. Without vSrc, modulating these cellular processes reconstitutes vSrc-like extrusion, confirming their sufficiency for this process.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adherens Junctions", "Animals", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Cell Line, Transformed", "Cell Polarity", "Cell Survival", "Cytokinesis", "Dogs", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Enzyme Activation", "Epithelium", "Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells", "Mitosis", "Phosphorylation", "src-Family Kinases", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056246025", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56326363500": {"Name": "Anton K.", "AuthorID": "56326363500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell & Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7403302053": {"Name": "Tada M.", "AuthorID": "7403302053", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell & Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "8876218600": {"Name": "Kajita M.", "AuthorID": "8876218600", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering"}, "57189871992": {"Name": "Narumi R.", "AuthorID": "57189871992", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering"}, "57199478003": {"Name": "Fujita Y.", "AuthorID": "57199478003", "AffiliationID": "60014652", "AffiliationName": "Division of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Chemical Sciences and Engineering"}}}
