One framework considers thermal operations - unitaries which conserve energy. The other framework considers all maps which preserve the Gibbs state at a given temperature. Thermal operations preserve the Gibbs state; hence a natural question which arises is whether the two frameworks are equivalent. Classically, this is true - Gibbs-preserving maps are no more powerful than thermal operations. Here, we show that this no longer holds in the quantum regime: a Gibbs-preserving map can generate coherent superpositions of energy levels while thermal operations cannot. This gap has an impact on clarifying a mathematical framework for quantum thermodynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gibbs-preserving maps", "quantum thermodynamics", "resource theory", "thermal operations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coherent superpositions", "Conserve energy", "Gibbs state", "Mathematical frameworks", "Quantum regimes", "Quantum thermodynamics", "resource theory", "Thermal operations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930505193", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56674694300": {"Name": "Faist P.", "AuthorID": "56674694300", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH"}, "56846750100": {"Name": "Renner R.", "AuthorID": "56846750100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH"}, "7102137778": {"Name": "Oppenheim J.", "AuthorID": "7102137778", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department for Physics and Astronomy, University College of London"}}}
