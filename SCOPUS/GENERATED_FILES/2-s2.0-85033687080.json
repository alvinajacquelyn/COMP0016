It suggests that it is possible to resolve this dilemma, through creating a vertical structure that complements the horizontal task of comparison across fieldsites. This vertical structure is composed of different methods of dissemination which make explicit a series of steps from a baseline of popular dissemination which stresses the uniqueness of individuals, through books and journal articles with increasing degrees of generalisation and comparison. Following this structure leads us up through analysis to the creation and employment of theory. This allows us to make comparisons and generalisations without sacrificing our assertion of specificity and uniqueness. We illustrate this argument though a recent nine-field site comparison of the use and consequences of social media in a project called \u2018Why We Post.\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comparative anthropology", "digital anthropology", "dissemination", "social media", "theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85033687080", "SubjectAreas": [["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"55494852500": {"Name": "Miller D.", "AuthorID": "55494852500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57196721274": {"Name": "Haapio-Kirk L.", "AuthorID": "57196721274", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57196703822": {"Name": "Spyer J.", "AuthorID": "57196703822", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57214250981": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "57214250981", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57190089338": {"Name": "Costa E.", "AuthorID": "57190089338", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "University of Groningen"}, "55970615400": {"Name": "Haynes N.", "AuthorID": "55970615400", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Northwestern University"}, "34880716800": {"Name": "Sinanan J.", "AuthorID": "34880716800", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "RMIT University"}, "37009827900": {"Name": "McDonald T.", "AuthorID": "37009827900", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong"}, "57196708922": {"Name": "Nicolescu R.", "AuthorID": "57196708922", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "57196727710": {"Name": "Venkatraman S.", "AuthorID": "57196727710", "AffiliationID": "60105479", "AffiliationName": "Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology"}}}
