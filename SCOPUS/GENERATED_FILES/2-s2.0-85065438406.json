This article presents the results of a national survey into whether, what, how and why adults across Britain may read aloud rather than in silence. Analysing data from 529 questionnaire responses, the article examines the frequency with which different text types are read aloud, the formations in which this is done\u2013alone, with one other person or in a group\u2013and the purposes of reading aloud and being read to, with attention to differences according to gender and age. Findings suggest that reading aloud happens in a number of different ways and for different purposes, across contexts and life domains, and that it has a significant relationship with aspects of the lifecourse and with identity formation and performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["adult literacy", "adult reading", "everyday reading", "literacy as social practice", "reading aloud"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065438406", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"35174263900": {"Name": "Duncan S.", "AuthorID": "35174263900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "29467559900": {"Name": "Freeman M.", "AuthorID": "29467559900", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
