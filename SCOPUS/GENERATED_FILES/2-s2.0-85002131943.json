We aimed to investigate whether urinary neopterin levels are associated with cognitive function in people with Down syndrome (DS). Methods Out of 32 adults with DS who originally participated in a longitudinal study, 25 were followed up at 4 years. Informants rated their adaptive behavior (ABAS) and the adults with DS attempted assessments of language skills and memory at both baseline and follow-up time points (Modified Memory Object Task, MOMT), and receptive vocabulary (British Picture Vocabulary Scale, BPVS). Results Neopterin/creatinine levels were negatively correlated with change in the MOMT total score (Spearman's Rho = \u22120.517, p = 0.020) and change in the MOMT delayed recall score (Spearman's Rho = \u22120.577, p = 0.008) over time, i.e. higher neopterin/creatinine level was associated with worse performance on a test of cognitive ability over time. Conclusion Urine neopterin may have potential as a biomarker for memory decline in Down syndrome, and could potentially also help to track progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease in other high risk populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Alzheimer's disease", "Down syndrome", "Memory", "Neopterin", "Oxidative stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Alzheimer Disease", "Cognition", "Disease Progression", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Memory", "Memory Disorders", "Mental Recall", "Middle Aged", "Neopterin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002131943", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57199650314": {"Name": "Zis P.", "AuthorID": "57199650314", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Department of Neurology"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "115862034", "AffiliationName": "The LonDowns Consortium"}, "56514680900": {"Name": "Buckley D.", "AuthorID": "56514680900", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield, Centre for Biomarker Research, School of Applied Sciences"}, "57192253765": {"Name": "Adekitan D.", "AuthorID": "57192253765", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield, Centre for Biomarker Research, School of Applied Sciences"}, "13607165500": {"Name": "McHugh P.C.", "AuthorID": "13607165500", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield, Centre for Biomarker Research, School of Applied Sciences"}}}
