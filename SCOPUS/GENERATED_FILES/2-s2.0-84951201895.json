Published by the American Physical Society.Diagnosing plasma conditions can give great advantages in optimizing plasma wakefield accelerator experiments. One possible method is that of photon acceleration. By propagating a laser probe pulse through a plasma wakefield and extracting the imposed frequency modulation, one can obtain an image of the density modulation of the wakefield. In order to diagnose the wakefield parameters at a chosen point in the plasma, the probe pulse crosses the plasma at oblique angles relative to the wakefield. In this paper, mathematical expressions relating the frequency modulation of the laser pulse and the wakefield density profile of the plasma for oblique crossing angles are derived. Multidimensional particle-in-cell simulation results presented in this paper confirm that the frequency modulation profiles and the density modulation profiles agree to within 10%. Limitations to the accuracy of the measurement are discussed in this paper. This technique opens new possibilities to quantitatively diagnose the plasma wakefield density at known positions within the plasma column.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951201895", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"]], "AuthorData": {"56644405900": {"Name": "Kasim M.F.", "AuthorID": "56644405900", "AffiliationID": "60162111", "AffiliationName": "John Adams Institute, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "57192660305": {"Name": "Holloway J.", "AuthorID": "57192660305", "AffiliationID": "60162111", "AffiliationName": "John Adams Institute, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "7102657549": {"Name": "Burrows P.N.", "AuthorID": "7102657549", "AffiliationID": "60162111", "AffiliationName": "John Adams Institute, Denys Wilkinson Building"}, "56644859000": {"Name": "Ceurvorst L.", "AuthorID": "56644859000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "36059642200": {"Name": "Levy M.C.", "AuthorID": "36059642200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "56644680200": {"Name": "Ratan N.", "AuthorID": "56644680200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "56644173900": {"Name": "Sadler J.", "AuthorID": "56644173900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "24528741800": {"Name": "Norreys P.", "AuthorID": "24528741800", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "35475275200": {"Name": "Bingham R.", "AuthorID": "35475275200", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Strathclyde"}, "9636056500": {"Name": "Trines R.", "AuthorID": "9636056500", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "35279041700": {"Name": "Wing M.", "AuthorID": "35279041700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
