No more than a hundred years separate emergence from eclipse. But in that period it managed to attract some of the most talented poets Greece ever produced, and to encapsulate her highest physical and ethical ideals. And despite the relative brevity of its life as a productive poetic genre, the limited range of its values and aspirations and the social exclusivity of the groups to which it primarily spoke, it has through the poetry of Pindar exercised a lasting influence on subsequent literary tradition, notably the European classical tradition from the Renaissance through to the poetry of Holderlin. Pindar still embodies Greek lyricism in all its fascinating otherness: he is a challenge and frustration to readers and critics alike. The nature, historical, generic and cultural context of the victory ode, its impact and transmission in antiquity and its reception in the modern world were the subject of an international conference held at University College London in July 2006. The premise was a simple one: that after half a century in which different trends and approaches have emerged in Pindaric criticism with remarkable speed, and different disciplines and theories within and beyond classical scholarship been brought to bear, the time had come to take stock of the state of research in the field and to see where the interesting ideas were to be found. This was the first conference of this type and scale devoted to the genre. The present book gathers together many of the papers from that conference which dealt with the victory ode in its Archaic and Classical Greek contexts. A separate volume currently in preparation addresses the reception of epinician poetry from fifth-century tragedy through ancient Alexandria to modern Greece.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926105213", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"7801582714": {"Name": "Ag\u00f3cs P.", "AuthorID": "7801582714", "AffiliationID": "60079645", "AffiliationName": "Christ\u2019s College"}, "56577685500": {"Name": "Carey C.", "AuthorID": "56577685500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "12782667400": {"Name": "Rawles R.", "AuthorID": "12782667400", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Classics, University of Nottingham"}}}
