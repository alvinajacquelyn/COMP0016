We establish the Sobolev regularity of the homogeneous problem for both smooth and nonsmooth initial data v, including v\u2208L2(\u03a9). A space semidiscrete Galerkin scheme using continuous piecewise linear finite elements is developed, and optimal with respect to initial data regularity error estimates for the finite element approximations are derived. Further, two fully discrete schemes based on the backward Euler method and second-order backward difference method and the related convolution quadrature are developed, and optimal error estimates are derived for the fully discrete approximations for both smooth and nonsmooth initial data. Numerical results for one- and two-dimensional examples with smooth and nonsmooth initial data are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the method, and to verify the convergence theory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["65M15", "65M60"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939259217", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"6507427736": {"Name": "Bazhlekova E.", "AuthorID": "6507427736", "AffiliationID": "60014774, 60024147", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematics and Informatics, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7003806023": {"Name": "Lazarov R.", "AuthorID": "7003806023", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A&M University"}, "8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55649851300": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "55649851300", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Texas A&M University"}}}
