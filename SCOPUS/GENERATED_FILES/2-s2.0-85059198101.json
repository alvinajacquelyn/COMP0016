While \u201csmart city\u201d advocates are keen to promote the benefits of smart urbanism - increased efficiency, sustainability, resilience, competitiveness, safety and security - critics point to the negative effects, such as the production of technocratic governance, the corporatization of urban services, technological lock-ins, privacy harms and vulnerability to cyberattack. This book, through a range of international case studies, suggests social, political and practical interventions that would enable more equitable and just smart cities, reaping the benefits of smart city initiatives while minimizing some of their perils. Included are case studies from Ireland, the United States of America, Colombia, the Netherlands, Singapore, India and the United Kingdom. These chapters discuss a range of issues including political economy, citizenship, standards, testbedding, urban regeneration, ethics, surveillance, privacy and cybersecurity. This book will be of interest to urban policymakers, as well as researchers in Regional Studies and Urban Planning.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059198101", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"], ["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56153747500": {"Name": "Coletta C.", "AuthorID": "56153747500", "AffiliationID": "60012937", "AffiliationName": "Urban Studies Institute, University of Antwerp"}, "57117152200": {"Name": "Evans L.", "AuthorID": "57117152200", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Media and Communications, Swansea University"}, "55322763600": {"Name": "Heaphy L.", "AuthorID": "55322763600", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, Planning and Environmental Policy, University College Dublin"}, "26642984800": {"Name": "Kitchin R.", "AuthorID": "26642984800", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "Maynooth University Social Sciences Institute, Maynooth University"}}}
