Results: The first structure of a Firmicute Sps protein YuiC from B. subtilis, is found to be a stripped down version of the cell-wall peptidoglycan hydrolase MltA. The YuiC structures are of a domain swapped dimer, although some monomer is also found in solution. The protein crystallised in the presence of pentasaccharide shows a 1,6-anhydrodisaccharide sugar product, indicating that YuiC cleaves the sugar backbone to form an anhydro product at least on lengthy incubation during crystallisation. Conclusions: The structural simplification of MltA in Sps proteins is analogous to that of the resuscitation promoting factor domains of Actinobacteria, which are stripped down versions of lysozyme and soluble lytic transglycosylase proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dormancy", "Firmicutes", "Peptidoglycan", "Resuscitation promoting factors", "Stationary phase survival"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acid Phosphatase", "Bacillus subtilis", "Bacterial Proteins", "Catalytic Domain", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Glycosyltransferases", "Models, Molecular", "Oligosaccharides", "Protein Structure, Secondary"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936855054", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"]], "AuthorData": {"56311060000": {"Name": "Quay D.H.X.", "AuthorID": "56311060000", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "7201573921": {"Name": "Cole A.R.", "AuthorID": "7201573921", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "15840628700": {"Name": "Thalassinos K.", "AuthorID": "15840628700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "57190893677": {"Name": "Williams M.A.", "AuthorID": "57190893677", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "6701498589": {"Name": "Bhakta S.", "AuthorID": "6701498589", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "7003604750": {"Name": "Keep N.H.", "AuthorID": "7003604750", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Structural and Molecular Biology, Department of Biological Sciences, Birkbeck University of London"}, "55559403100": {"Name": "Cryar A.", "AuthorID": "55559403100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
