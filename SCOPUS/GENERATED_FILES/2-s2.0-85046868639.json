Today it is considered a key treatment modality in patients who are resistant to pharmacological intervention. It improves seizure control, cognition and quality of life. New technologies, advances in surgical technique and progress in scientific research underlie the expansion of surgery in epilepsy treatment. Effectiveness of surgical treatment depends on several factors including the type of epilepsy, the underlying pathology and the localisation of the epileptogenic zone. Timely referral to an experienced epilepsy surgery centre is important to allow the greatest chance of seizure control and to minimise associated morbidity and mortality. Following referral, patients undergo thorough presurgical investigation to evaluate their suitability for surgery. The commonest form of epilepsy treated by surgery is mesial temporal lobe sclerosis and there is Class I evidence for the medium-term efficacy of temporal lobe resection from two randomised control trials. Various other forms of epilepsy are now considered for respective and neuromodulatory surgical intervention due to favourable results. In this article, the authors review the current status of surgical treatment for epilepsy including the presurgical evaluation of patients, surgical techniques and the future directions in epilepsy surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "Epilepsy", "Seizure", "Surgery", "Temporal lobe", "Vagal nerve stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046868639", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"55355731000": {"Name": "Rasul F.T.", "AuthorID": "55355731000", "AffiliationID": "60007800", "AffiliationName": "Essex Neurosciences Centre, Barking, Havering and Redbridge University NHS Trust"}, "57212944428": {"Name": "Bal J.", "AuthorID": "57212944428", "AffiliationID": "60007800", "AffiliationName": "Essex Neurosciences Centre, Barking, Havering and Redbridge University NHS Trust"}, "21833814500": {"Name": "Haliasos N.", "AuthorID": "21833814500", "AffiliationID": "60007800", "AffiliationName": "Essex Neurosciences Centre, Barking, Havering and Redbridge University NHS Trust"}, "57196768210": {"Name": "Pereira E.A.", "AuthorID": "57196768210", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neurosurgery Unit, St. George\u2019s, University of London"}, "16242763100": {"Name": "Tisdall M.", "AuthorID": "16242763100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "23989581400": {"Name": "Themistocleous M.", "AuthorID": "23989581400", "AffiliationID": "102011496", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery, Agia Sofia Hospital"}}}
