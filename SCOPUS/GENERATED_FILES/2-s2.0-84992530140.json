OBJECTIVE: To describe the incidence, presentation, treatment and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis (TB) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected children. DESIGN: Observational study of TB diagnosed in HIVinfected children in 2011-2013. RESULTS: Of 4265 children aged <16 years, 127 (3%) were diagnosed with TB: 6 (5%) in Western Europe, 80 (63%) in Eastern Europe, 27 (21%) in Thailand and 14 (11%) in Brazil, with estimated TB incidence rates of respectively 239, 982, 1633 and 2551 per 100 000 person-years (py). The majority (94%) had acquired HIV perinatally. The median age at TB diagnosis was 6.8 years (interquartile range 3.0-11.5). Over half (52%) had advanced/severeWorld Health Organization stage immunodeficiency; 67 (53%) were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at TB diagnosis. Preventive antituberculosis treatment was given to 23% (n=23) of 102 children diagnosed with HIV before TB. Eleven children had unfavourable TB outcomes: 4 died, 5 did not complete treatment, 1 had recurrent TB and 1 had an unknown outcome. In univariable analysis, previous diagnosis of acquired immune-deficiency syndrome, not being virologically suppressed on ART at TB diagnosis and region (Brazil) were significantly associated with unfavourable TB outcomes. CONCLUSION: Most TB cases were from countries with high TB prevalence. The majority (91%) had favourable outcomes. Universal ART and TB prophylaxis may reduce missed opportunities for TB prevention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "HIV-TB coinfection", "Observational study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibiotic Prophylaxis", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Antitubercular Agents", "Body Mass Index", "Brazil", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Coinfection", "Europe", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Thailand", "Tuberculosis", "World Health Organization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992530140", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"26031175500": {"Name": "Turkova A.", "AuthorID": "26031175500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London (UCL), Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "57021440000": {"Name": "Chappell E.", "AuthorID": "57021440000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London (UCL), Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "57191709288": {"Name": "Calvert J.", "AuthorID": "57191709288", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London (UCL), Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "57191039241": {"Name": "Goodall R.", "AuthorID": "57191039241", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London (UCL), Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "19434501100": {"Name": "Judd A.", "AuthorID": "19434501100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London (UCL), Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "55840457700": {"Name": "Chalermpantmetagul S.", "AuthorID": "55840457700", "AffiliationID": "60091478", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit, Program for HIV Prevention and Treatment, Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement Unit\u00e9s Mixtes Internationales 174"}, "26642977900": {"Name": "Jourdain G.", "AuthorID": "26642977900", "AffiliationID": "60091478", "AffiliationName": "Research Unit, Program for HIV Prevention and Treatment, Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9veloppement Unit\u00e9s Mixtes Internationales 174"}, "57220001789": {"Name": "Della Negra M.", "AuthorID": "57220001789", "AffiliationID": "60042374", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Infectologia Emilio Ribas, S\u00e3o Paolo"}, "8262589000": {"Name": "Volokha A.", "AuthorID": "8262589000", "AffiliationID": "60104585", "AffiliationName": "Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education"}, "57191706985": {"Name": "Kiselyova G.", "AuthorID": "57191706985", "AffiliationID": "60104585", "AffiliationName": "Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education"}, "57191706657": {"Name": "Primak N.", "AuthorID": "57191706657", "AffiliationID": "117573871", "AffiliationName": "Kryvyi Rih City Centre for Prevention and Control of AIDS"}, "26530611600": {"Name": "Solokha S.", "AuthorID": "26530611600", "AffiliationID": "117573745", "AffiliationName": "Donetsk Regional Centre for Prevention and Control of AIDS"}, "57191709030": {"Name": "Rozenberg V.", "AuthorID": "57191709030", "AffiliationID": "100907088", "AffiliationName": "Irkutsk Regional Centre for Prevention and Control of AIDS and Infectious Diseases"}, "57191707379": {"Name": "Yastrebova E.", "AuthorID": "57191707379", "AffiliationID": "101895714", "AffiliationName": "St Petersburg City Centre for Prevention and Control of AIDS and Infectious Diseases"}, "57191708934": {"Name": "Miloenko M.", "AuthorID": "57191708934", "AffiliationID": "107086014", "AffiliationName": "Republican Clinical Hospital of Infectious Diseases"}, "57191709492": {"Name": "Bashakatova N.", "AuthorID": "57191709492", "AffiliationID": "117573833", "AffiliationName": "Marioupol City Centre for Prevention and Control of AIDS"}, "8503049600": {"Name": "Kanjanavanit S.", "AuthorID": "8503049600", "AffiliationID": "60031637", "AffiliationName": "Nakornping Hospital"}, "7004238121": {"Name": "Rojo P.", "AuthorID": "7004238121", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60004024", "AffiliationName": "Hospital 12 de Octubre, Universidad Complutense"}, "57191707294": {"Name": "Ansone S.", "AuthorID": "57191707294", "AffiliationID": "60088863", "AffiliationName": "Riga East University Hospital, Latvian Centre of Infectious Diseases"}, "11539661200": {"Name": "Malyuta R.", "AuthorID": "11539661200", "AffiliationID": "107018198", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Prevention of AIDS Initiative"}, "7101873678": {"Name": "Thorne C.", "AuthorID": "7101873678", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, UCL"}}}
