The study highlights some considerations to be made and parameters to be tested in the context of a model fluorination reaction, which is the first organic fluorination to be attempted using extrusion. Upon optimization, which features the first use of grinding auxiliary solids to enable effective synthetic extrusion, the difluorination reaction was successfully translated to the extruder, leading to a 100-fold improvement in Space Time Yield (STY); 29 kg m-3 day-1 in a mixer mill to 3395 kg m-3 day-1 in a twin screw extruder.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054490406", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"55765529300": {"Name": "Cao Q.", "AuthorID": "55765529300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Main Building, Cardiff University"}, "57190022638": {"Name": "Howard J.L.", "AuthorID": "57190022638", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Main Building, Cardiff University"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.L.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Main Building, Cardiff University"}, "36061710000": {"Name": "Crawford D.E.", "AuthorID": "36061710000", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, David Keir Building, Queen's University Belfast"}, "35517536500": {"Name": "James S.L.", "AuthorID": "35517536500", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, David Keir Building, Queen's University Belfast"}}}
