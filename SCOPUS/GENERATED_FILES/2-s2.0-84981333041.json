This tax system has historically relied on zero deterrence so that any compliance at baseline is intrinsically motivated. Starting from this zero deterrence baseline, we implement a field experiment that incentivized compliance through deterrence or rewards. Using administrative records of taxes paid and true tax liabilities, we use these treatments to document that intrinsically motivated compliance is substantial, that a significant fraction of it may be driven by duty-to-comply preferences, and that there is no crowd-out between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981333041", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"25647542100": {"Name": "Dwenger N.", "AuthorID": "25647542100", "AffiliationID": "60018373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Hohenheim"}, "6602214084": {"Name": "Kleven H.", "AuthorID": "6602214084", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "London School of Economics"}, "12796887500": {"Name": "Rasul I.", "AuthorID": "12796887500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Drayton House"}, "22635255500": {"Name": "Rincke J.", "AuthorID": "22635255500", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg"}}}
