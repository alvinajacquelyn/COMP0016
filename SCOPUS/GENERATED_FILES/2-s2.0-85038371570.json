Our objective with this review was to determine whether any given patch type is preferable to the others based on the evaluation of the results of published studies. A systematic search of the literature was conducted from PubMed until December 2016. Articles reporting basic research, animal research, reviews or meta-analyses and studies in children were eliminated. Series with patients undergoing some kind of other surgical intervention were only included if results were reported separately. Case reports and series of five patients were excluded. Five variables were selected to evaluate the results: number of patients, follow-up period, straightening rate, shortening rate and post-operative ED rate. For this purpose, 69 papers were included for review, and the outcomes of the use of autologous dermis, tunica vaginalis, dura mater, fascia, saphenous vein, tunica albuginea, buccal mucosa, porcine intestinal submucosa, pericardium, TachoSil\u00ae and synthetic materials were presented and analysed separately. The different series published are extremely variable and heterogeneous in terms of the number of patients included, patient selection, follow-up periods, and in the measurement and interpretation of the outcomes analysed. Given these facts, it is not possible to draw any definitive conclusion, homogeneous, prospective studies using validated tools are required to determine which the ideal graft is.", "AuthorKeywords": ["grafts", "lengthening procedure", "Peyronie's disease"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Heterografts", "Humans", "Male", "Penile Induration", "Transplants", "Urologic Surgical Procedures, Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038371570", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"56020681400": {"Name": "Garcia-Gomez B.", "AuthorID": "56020681400", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "8968569000": {"Name": "Romero-Otero J.", "AuthorID": "8968569000", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Urology and Andrology, University College Hospital"}, "7202673106": {"Name": "Levine L.", "AuthorID": "7202673106", "AffiliationID": "60002032", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Rush University"}, "6701416505": {"Name": "Moncada-Iribarren I.", "AuthorID": "6701416505", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, La Zarzuela University Hospital"}, "20734254600": {"Name": "Djinovic R.", "AuthorID": "20734254600", "AffiliationID": "119923580", "AffiliationName": "Sava Perovic Foundation"}, "36136496600": {"Name": "Albersen M.", "AuthorID": "36136496600", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "36172223000": {"Name": "Garcia-Cruz E.", "AuthorID": "36172223000", "AffiliationID": "114327636", "AffiliationName": "REISHO and Clinic University Hospital"}}}
