The present study extended this to pro-social behaviour, investigating the influence of expectations to help others. A novel task describing characters in need of help was administered to students scoring high versus low on the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. Scenarios had two variants, describing either a \u2018clear-cut\u2019 or \u2018ambiguous\u2019 social rule. Participants with high versus low autistic traits were less pro-social and sympathetic overall towards the characters. The groups\u2019 ratings of characters\u2019 expectations were comparable, but those with high autistic traits provided more rule-based rationales in the clear-cut condition. This pattern of relatively intact knowledge in the context of reduced pro-social behaviour has implications for social skill training programmes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autistic traits", "Empathy", "Mentalising", "Pro-social behaviour", "Social knowledge", "Social rules"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Empathy", "Female", "Group Processes", "Helping Behavior", "Humans", "Male", "Social Behavior Disorders", "Social Conformity", "Social Responsibility", "Social Skills", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Theory of Mind", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937968585", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"56030184400": {"Name": "Jameel L.", "AuthorID": "56030184400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London (UCL)"}, "56030501300": {"Name": "Vyas K.", "AuthorID": "56030501300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London (UCL)"}, "56029263500": {"Name": "Bellesi G.", "AuthorID": "56029263500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006607949": {"Name": "Channon S.", "AuthorID": "7006607949", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London (UCL)"}, "56524248100": {"Name": "Cassell D.", "AuthorID": "56524248100", "AffiliationID": "110049532", "AffiliationName": "Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, South West London and St George\u2019s Mental Health Trust"}}}
