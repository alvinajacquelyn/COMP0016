Objective: The aim of this study is to examine whether the extent and severity of WM tract damage differ between cognitively impaired (CI) and cognitively preserved (CP) secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) patients. Methods: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI were acquired from 30 SPMS patients and 32 healthy controls (HC). Cognitive domains commonly affected in MS patients were assessed. Linear regression was used to predict cognition. Diffusion measures were compared between groups using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Results: A total of 12 patients were classified as CI, and processing speed was the most commonly affected domain. The final regression model including demographic variables and radial diffusivity explained the greatest variance of cognitive performance (R2 = 0.48, p = 0.002). SPMS patients showed widespread loss of WM integrity throughout the WM skeleton when compared with HC. When compared with CP patients, CI patients showed more extensive and severe damage of several WM tracts, including the fornix, superior longitudinal fasciculus and forceps major. Conclusion: Loss of WM integrity assessed using TBSS helps to explain cognitive decline in SPMS patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cognition", "DTI", "MRI", "Multiple sclerosis", "myelination", "secondary progressive"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Female", "Humans", "Leukoencephalopathies", "Linear Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis, Chronic Progressive", "Neuropsychological Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989905177", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56583871500": {"Name": "Meijer K.A.", "AuthorID": "56583871500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "26643174700": {"Name": "Geurts J.J.G.", "AuthorID": "26643174700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, VU University Medical Centre"}, "36010957200": {"Name": "Muhlert N.", "AuthorID": "36010957200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "55317343100": {"Name": "Sethi V.", "AuthorID": "55317343100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7103115518": {"Name": "Ron M.A.", "AuthorID": "7103115518", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "7404597283": {"Name": "Thompson A.J.", "AuthorID": "7404597283", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57202559286": {"Name": "Miller D.H.", "AuthorID": "57202559286", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7004057758": {"Name": "Chard D.", "AuthorID": "7004057758", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7003671038": {"Name": "Ciccarelli O.", "AuthorID": "7003671038", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "NIHR University College London Hospitals, Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6603813790": {"Name": "Cercignani M.", "AuthorID": "6603813790", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Imaging Centre, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}}}
