However, there is little work analyzing the characteristics of abusive users and what distinguishes them from typical social media users. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing tweets containing a great amount of abusiveness. We focus on a Twitter dataset revolving around the Gamergate controversy, which led to many incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression on various gaming and social media platforms. We study the properties of the users tweeting about Gamergate, the content they post, and the differences in their behavior compared to typical Twitter users. We find that while their tweets are often seemingly about aggressive and hateful subjects, \"Gamergaters\" do not exhibit common expressions of online anger, and in fact primarily differ from typical users in that their tweets are less joyful. They are also more engaged than typical Twitter users, which is an indication as to how and why this controversy is still ongoing. Surprisingly, we find that Gamergaters are less likely to be suspended by Twitter, thus we analyze their properties to identify differences from typical users and what may have led to their suspension. We perform an unsupervised machine learning analysis to detect clusters of users who, though currently active, could be considered for suspension since they exhibit similar behaviors with suspended users. Finally, we confirm the usefulness of our analyzed features by emulating the Twitter suspension mechanism with a supervised learning method, achieving very good precision and recall.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cyber bullying", "Precision and recall", "Social media", "Social media platforms", "Supervised learning methods", "Suspension mechanism", "Unsupervised machine learning"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026415136", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"48761069800": {"Name": "Chatzakou D.", "AuthorID": "48761069800", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "6701925503": {"Name": "Vakali A.", "AuthorID": "6701925503", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "25825228300": {"Name": "Kourtellis N.", "AuthorID": "25825228300", "AffiliationID": "60010156", "AffiliationName": "Telefonica Research"}, "25630344400": {"Name": "Blackburn J.", "AuthorID": "25630344400", "AffiliationID": "60010156", "AffiliationName": "Telefonica Research"}, "17433897300": {"Name": "De Cristofaro E.", "AuthorID": "17433897300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36810977700": {"Name": "Stringhini G.", "AuthorID": "36810977700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
