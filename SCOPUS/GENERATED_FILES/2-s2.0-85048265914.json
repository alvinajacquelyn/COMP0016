Here, tablets (printlets) comprising of paracetamol dispersed in polyethylene glycol were printed using stereolithographic 3D printing. A number of geometric shapes were produced (cube, disc, pyramid, sphere and torus) with either constant surface area (SA) or constant surface area/volume ratio (SA/V). Dissolution testing showed that printlets with constant SA/V ratio released drug at the same rate, while those with constant SA released drug at different rates. A series of tori with increasing SA/V ratio (from 0.5 to 2.4) were printed, and it was found that dissolution rate increased as the SA/V ratio increased. The data show that printlets can be fabricated in multiple shapes and that dissolution performance can be maintained if the SA/V ratio is constant or that dissolution performance of printlets can be fine-tuned by varying SA/V ratio. The results suggest that 3D printing is therefore a suitable manufacturing method for personalized dosage forms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acetaminophen", "additive manufacturing", "stereolithography", "tablets", "three-dimensional printing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetaminophen", "Drug Liberation", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Powders", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Stereolithography", "Tablets", "Technology, Pharmaceutical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048265914", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57195631613": {"Name": "Martinez P.", "AuthorID": "57195631613", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "37037477300": {"Name": "Goyanes A.", "AuthorID": "37037477300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003826707": {"Name": "Basit A.", "AuthorID": "7003826707", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
