As a consequence, health-related quality of life is often impaired and the upper urinary tract might be at risk for damage. The aim of this review is to give an overview of current treatment options for LUT dysfunction in patients with MS. Recent Findings: The treatment is tailored to the type of dysfunction\u2014storage or voiding dysfunction\u2014beginning with conservative treatment options and ending with invasive therapies and surgery. Additionally, alternative options, e.g., different intravesical therapies or cannabinoids, have been evaluated in recent years with promising results. Summary: Current available therapies offer different possible treatments for LUT dysfunction in patients with MS. They address either voiding or storage dysfunction and therefore ameliorate LUT symptoms improve quality of life and protect the upper urinary tract.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Incontinence", "Multiple sclerosis", "Neurogenic bladder treatment", "Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction", "Retention", "Review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Management", "Humans", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Quality of Life", "Urinary Tract"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049160738", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"34881002400": {"Name": "Tornic J.", "AuthorID": "34881002400", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital For Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute for Neurology"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital For Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute for Neurology"}}}
