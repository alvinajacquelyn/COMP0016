The absorption geometry of H2O in Y2Mo3O12 and the binding property between H2O and Y2Mo3O12 have been first identified. Our calculated results show that water is chemisorbed in Y2Mo3O12 with O of the water binding to the Y3+ cation, which is further strengthened by hydrogen bonding between each of the hydrogen atoms of H2O and the bridge O in Y2Mo3O12, shared by polyhedrons YO6 and MoO4. The absorption of water leads to a reduced angle of Y-O-Mo and shortened Y-Mo distance, and consequently volume contraction of the material, almost linearly with the increasing number of water molecules per unit cell, up to eight in total. In addition, our phonon calculation show that the transverse vibration of Y-O-Mo is restricted due to water absorption, which in turn hinders the NTE, as it is mainly originated from this vibrational mode. Our results clarify further the fundamental mechanisms of the large volume shrinkage and the lost NTE of the framework oxide due to water absorption.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Binding properties", "Fundamental mechanisms", "Phonon calculation", "Theoretical study", "Transverse vibrations", "Vibrational modes", "Volume contraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923347302", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56076654300": {"Name": "Wu M.", "AuthorID": "56076654300", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "57213182125": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57213182125", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "7401504128": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "7401504128", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "56472195100": {"Name": "Sun Q.", "AuthorID": "56472195100", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "International Laboratory for Quantum Functional Materials of Henan, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
