They miniaturize assays to reduce sample and reagent consumption and increase throughput, and additionally uncover static and dynamic heterogeneity usually masked in molecular ensembles. However, realizing single-DNA arrays must tackle the challenge of capturing structurally highly dynamic strands onto defined substrate positions. Here, we create single-molecule arrays by electrostatically adhering single-stranded DNA of gene-like length onto positively charged carbon nanoislands. The nanosites are so small that only one molecule can bind per island. Undesired adsorption of DNA to the surrounding non-target areas is prevented via a surface-passivating film. Of further relevance, the DNA arrays are of tunable dimensions, and fabricated on optically transparent substrates that enable singe-molecule detection with fluorescence microscopy. The arrays are hence compatible with a wide range of bioanalytical, biophysical, and cell biological studies where individual DNA strands are either examined in isolation, or interact with other molecules or cells.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Single Molecule Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012241962", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56734258800": {"Name": "Hager R.", "AuthorID": "56734258800", "AffiliationID": "109577649", "AffiliationName": "Center for Advanced Bioanalysis GmbH"}, "8389134100": {"Name": "Howorka S.", "AuthorID": "8389134100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6508064379": {"Name": "Halilovic A.", "AuthorID": "6508064379", "AffiliationID": "60021931", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Semiconductor and Solid State Physics, Johannes Kepler University"}, "7004495079": {"Name": "Sch\u00e4ffler F.", "AuthorID": "7004495079", "AffiliationID": "60021931", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Semiconductor and Solid State Physics, Johannes Kepler University"}, "37087024100": {"Name": "Burns J.", "AuthorID": "37087024100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
