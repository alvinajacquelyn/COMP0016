To achieve the required time resolution for effective fluorescence rejection, a picosecond pulsed laser and a single-photon avalanche diode were used. A module consisting of a spectrometer, digital micromirror device, and two prisms was used for high-resolution spectral filtering and multiplexing, which is required for a high chemical specificity and short integration times. With this instrument, we demonstrated time-gated Raman imaging of highly fluorescent samples, achieving acquisition times as short as 3 min for 40 \u00d7 40 pixel resolution images.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical specificity", "Digital micro-mirror device", "Fluorescence rejection", "Laser induced fluorescence", "Multiplexed detection", "Raman micro spectroscopy", "Single photon avalanche diode", "Spectral filtering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057446469", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57204844884": {"Name": "Corden C.J.", "AuthorID": "57204844884", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "37082149700": {"Name": "Shipp D.W.", "AuthorID": "37082149700", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "6603933585": {"Name": "Notingher I.", "AuthorID": "6603933585", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nottingham"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UKRI"}}}
