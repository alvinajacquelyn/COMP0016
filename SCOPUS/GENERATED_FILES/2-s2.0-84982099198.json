Notwithstanding, new plants are being projected without taking into account how design choices affect the MPC's ability to deliver better control and optimization. Thus a methodology to determine if a certain design option favours or hinders MPC performance would be desirable. This paper presents the economic MPC optimization index whose intended use is to provide a procedure to compare different designs for a given process, assessing how well they can be controlled and optimised by a zone constrained MPC. The index quantifies the economic benefits available and how well the plant performs under MPC control given the plant's controllability properties, requirements and restrictions. The index provides a monetization measure of expected control performance. This approach assumes the availability of a linear state-space model valid within the control zone defined by the upper and lower bounds of each controlled and manipulated variable. We have used a model derived from simulation step tests as a practical way to use the method. The impact of model uncertainty on the methodology is discussed. An analysis of the effects of disturbances on the index illustrates how they may reduce profitability by restricting the ability of a MPC to reach dynamic equilibrium near process restrictions, which in turn increases product quality giveaway and costs. A case of study consisting of four alternative designs for a realistically sized crude oil atmospheric distillation plant is provided in order to demonstrate the applicability of the index.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Controllability analysis", "Crude oil distillation", "Integrated process design and control", "Model predictive control (MPC)", "Zone constrained model predictive control", "Zone control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric distillation", "Constrained model predictive control", "Control and optimization", "Controllability analysis", "Integrated process designs", "Linear state space model", "Upper and lower bounds", "Zone controls"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982099198", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57190671047": {"Name": "Strutzel F.", "AuthorID": "57190671047", "AffiliationID": "60006171", "AffiliationName": "On leave from Petrobras Oil Company, Presidente Bernardes Refinery (RPBC)"}, "7004224932": {"Name": "Bogle I.", "AuthorID": "7004224932", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
