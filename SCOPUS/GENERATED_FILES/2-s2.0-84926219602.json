Whatever the neural root of this asynchrony, it creates a problem that has not been properly addressed, namely how visual attributes that are perceived asynchronously over brief time windows after stimulus onset are bound together in the longer termto give us a unified experience of the visual world, inwhich all attributes are apparently seen in perfect registration. In this review, I suggest that there is no central neural clock in the (visual) brain that synchronizes the activity of different processing systems. More likely, activity in each of the parallel processing-perceptual systems of the visual brain is reset independently, making of the brain a massively asynchronous organ, just like the new generation of more efficient computers promise to be. Given the asynchronous operations of the brain, it is likely that the results of activities in the different processing-perceptual systems are not bound by physiological interactions between cells in the specialized visual areas, but post-perceptually, outside the visual brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asynchronous brain operations", "Hierarchical processing", "Parallel processing", "Perceptual asynchrony", "Riddoch Syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Nerve Net", "Signal Transduction", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926219602", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"7005938062": {"Name": "Zeki S.", "AuthorID": "7005938062", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurobiology, University College London"}}}
