The purpose of this research is to identify user behaviour patterns during the search process, and develop a user model to illustrate the relationships between search behaviour and user perception, in order to predict user engagement in a cost-effective manner by using only behaviour data. To achieve this, we will use three datasets collected from previous studies containing both behavioural data from system log files and perception data. Ultimately, this research will yield a cost-efficient predictive model of user engagement that could be used to more effectively evaluate search systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cost effective", "Cost-efficient", "Predictive modeling", "Search behaviours", "Search process", "User behaviour", "User engagement", "User perceptions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026735124", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"57188722085": {"Name": "Zhuang M.", "AuthorID": "57188722085", "AffiliationID": "60116262", "AffiliationName": "Management School, University of Sheffield"}}}
