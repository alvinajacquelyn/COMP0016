Some previous concerns about these organs such as the high incidence of delayed graft function have been alleviated through evidence from adult studies. There are now a number of large adult cohorts reporting favorable 5-year outcomes for DCD kidney transplants, comparable to kidneys donated after brain death (DBD). This has resulted in a marked increase in the use of DCD kidneys for adult recipients in some countries and an increase in the overall number of kidney transplants. In contrast, the uptake of DCD kidneys for pediatric recipients is still low and concerns still exist over the longer-term outcomes of DCD organs. In view of the data from adult practice and the poor outcomes for children who stay on dialysis, DCD kidney transplantation should be offered as an option for children on the kidney transplant waiting list.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Donation after circulatory death", "Pediatrics", "Renal transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Donor Selection", "Humans", "Kidney Transplantation", "Pediatrics", "Tissue and Organ Procurement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941662818", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"57208565754": {"Name": "Marlais M.", "AuthorID": "57208565754", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "8889557300": {"Name": "Marks S.D.", "AuthorID": "8889557300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205929402": {"Name": "Callaghan C.", "AuthorID": "57205929402", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology and Transplantation, Guy\u2019s Hospital"}}}
