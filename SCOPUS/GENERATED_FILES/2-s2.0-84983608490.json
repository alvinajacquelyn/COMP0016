Due to the high Curie transition temperature of the parent BiFeO3 perovskite (\u223c830 \u00b0C), they are promising piezoelectric materials for use at elevated temperatures. However, the influence of the specific RE species on the electromechanical behavior at high temperatures and above the coercive electric-field is not widely reported. Here, structural analysis over multiple length scales using X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy is coupled with a high electric-field cycling study and in situ converse d33 measurements up to 325 \u00b0C for three RE-BFO ceramic compositions, Bi0.86Sm0.14FeO3, Bi0.88Gd0.12FeO3 and Bi0.91Dy0.09FeO3. The ceramics exhibit different phase assemblages with varying amounts of polar rhombohedral R3c and intermediate antipolar orthorhombic Pbam phases as a function of the RE species. During electric-field cycling at electric-fields with amplitudes of 160 kV cm-1, peak-to-peak strains of 0.23-0.27% are reached for all three compositions. However, there are qualitative differences in the field-induced strain and electric current behavior as a function of electric-field cycling and the materials exhibit an electrical-history dependent behavior. Bi0.91Dy0.09FeO3 possesses an improved d33 stability as a function of temperature relative to the parent BFO perovskite and the highest depolarization temperature among the three RE-BFO compositions, with a stable d33 of \u223c22 pC N-1 up to 325 \u00b0C.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coercive electric field", "Curie transition temperature", "Depolarization temperature", "Electric field hysteresis", "Electromechanical behavior", "Piezoelectric response", "Piezoresponse force microscopy", "Qualitative differences"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983608490", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56397402500": {"Name": "Walker J.", "AuthorID": "56397402500", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Ceramic Department, Jozef Stefan Institute Jamova Cesta"}, "23483108500": {"Name": "Ursic H.", "AuthorID": "23483108500", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Ceramic Department, Jozef Stefan Institute Jamova Cesta"}, "35607799700": {"Name": "Bencan A.", "AuthorID": "35607799700", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Ceramic Department, Jozef Stefan Institute Jamova Cesta"}, "7003264271": {"Name": "Malic B.", "AuthorID": "7003264271", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Ceramic Department, Jozef Stefan Institute Jamova Cesta"}, "10440417300": {"Name": "Rojac T.", "AuthorID": "10440417300", "AffiliationID": "60023955", "AffiliationName": "Electronic Ceramic Department, Jozef Stefan Institute Jamova Cesta"}, "36998852400": {"Name": "Simons H.", "AuthorID": "36998852400", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Technical University of Denmark"}, "35495971300": {"Name": "Reaney I.", "AuthorID": "35495971300", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "17347220500": {"Name": "Viola G.", "AuthorID": "17347220500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Science and Technology, Institute of Materials Physics and Engineering Corso Duca"}, "7005308340": {"Name": "Nagarajan V.", "AuthorID": "7005308340", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales"}}}
