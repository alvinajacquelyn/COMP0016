These impressions are later confirmed, modified, or overturned by the results of the next trial. On the other hand, insights that stem from the intuitions of experienced clinicians, scientists and educators-while often neglected-help place current thinking into proper perspective and occasionally point the way toward formulating novel hypotheses that direct future research. Both streams of information and opinion contribute to progress. In this paper we present a wide-ranging set of unproven 'out of the mainstream' ideas of our FCCM faculty, each with a defensible rationale and holding clear implications for altering bedside management. Each proposition was designed deliberately to be provocative so as to raise awareness, stimulate new thinking and initiate lively dialog.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive clinical trials", "Melatonin", "Metabolic monitoring", "Microcirculation", "Personalized medicine", "Resuscitation", "Sepsis", "Shock", "Ventilator-induced lung injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical Care", "Forecasting", "Humans", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039706630", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57210892902": {"Name": "Marini J.", "AuthorID": "57210892902", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota"}, "7006229372": {"Name": "De Backer D.", "AuthorID": "7006229372", "AffiliationID": "60000145, 60070048", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Department of Intensive Care, CHIREC Hospitals"}, "57202556001": {"Name": "Ince C.", "AuthorID": "57202556001", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "University of Amsterdam, Department of Translational Physiology, Academic Medical Center"}, "7401654716": {"Name": "Singer M.", "AuthorID": "7401654716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine"}, "55924922000": {"Name": "Van Haren F.", "AuthorID": "55924922000", "AffiliationID": "60016880", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care Unit, Canberra Hospital"}, "7102379546": {"Name": "Westphal M.", "AuthorID": "7102379546", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "University of Muenster, Department of Anesthesiology, Intensive Care and Pain Medicine"}, "6603692931": {"Name": "Wischmeyer P.", "AuthorID": "6603692931", "AffiliationID": "60005200, 60030982", "AffiliationName": "Duke University School of Medicine, Department of Anesthesiology and Surgery, Duke Clinical Research Institute"}}}
