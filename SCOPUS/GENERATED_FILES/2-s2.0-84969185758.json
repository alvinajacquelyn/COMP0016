This paper introduces the line structure\u2014 identified mathematically as a kind of linearly ordered incidence structure\u2014as a means of representing road network structure and demonstrates its relation to existing representations of road networks: the \u201cprimal\u201d graph, the \u201cdual\u201d graph, and the route structure. In doing so, the paper shows how properties of continuity, junction type, and hierarchy relating to differential continuity and termination are necessarily absent from primal and dual graph representations but intrinsically present in line structure representations. A new property indicative of hierarchical status\u2014 \u201ccardinality\u201d\u2014is introduced and illustrated with application to example networks. The paper concludes by highlighting newly explicit relationships between different kinds of road network structure representation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardinality", "Graph theory", "Line structure", "Network science", "Road hierarchy", "Route structure"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969185758", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"7401823365": {"Name": "Marshall S.", "AuthorID": "7401823365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
