However, as a social phenomenon it is frequently misunderstood, particularly by corporate lawyers. This article identifies two particularly common misunderstandings of the term within a legal context, where it has tended to be viewed (erroneously): first, as a mitigating counter-pressure to directorial decisional authority; and, second, as an inherent structural corollary to shareholder decisional empowerment \u2013 or, vice versa \u2013 board decisional disempowerment. The article takes issue with both of these perspectives, and \u2013 in response \u2013 develops a more nuanced alternative understanding of board accountability in corporate governance, derived from sociological and institutional-economic insights into the nature of accountability as a discrete social-relational practice. Essentially, accountability is understood here as the compelled provision by an authorised decision-maker (to her recognised decision-beneficiary) of normatively cognisable reasons in support of her discretionary decisions and/or actions, which has the ultimate effect of legitimising \u2013 and, in turn, sustaining \u2013 relational power imbalance between private decisional parties. By recognising these broader dimensions of board accountability as a social phenomenon, corporate lawyers \u2013 it is submitted \u2013 will be better positioned in future to grapple with the full institutional complexity of corporate governance as a subject of legal enquiry.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010375448", "SubjectAreas": [["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"36988268500": {"Name": "Moore M.", "AuthorID": "36988268500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Corporate and Commercial Law, Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge"}}}
