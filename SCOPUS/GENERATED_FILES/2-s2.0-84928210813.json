Data on postoperative clinical status, ventricular adaptation, and objective cardiopulmonary testing are lacking in these patients. Methods The clinical characteristics, echocardiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and exercise data from 27 consecutive cone reconstructions, undertaken from 2009 to 2013, were retrospectively compared between preoperative baseline and follow-up. Results There were no deaths. The cone TV functioned well in all but 1 patient with late dehiscence of inferior annuloplasty sutures that were subsequently repaired. Four patients required pacemaker insertion (3 for new complete heart block). At median follow-up of 2.7 \u00b1 1.5 years, tricuspid regurgitation was reduced in all patients, without causing stenosis. Global left ventricle function remained unchanged (pre-operative fraction 60% \u00b1 4% vs postoperative fraction 61% \u00b1 3%; P =.96). MRI showed enhanced forward pulmonary flow (pre 26 \u00b1 1 mL/beat vs post 36 \u00b1 10 mL/beat; P <.005) and increased left ventricle filling (body surface area-indexed left ventricle end-diastolic volume pre 49 \u00b1 14 mL/m2 vs post 60 \u00b1 14 mL/m2; P <.005). New York Heart Association functional class improved (pre 2.5 \u00b1 0.6 vs post 1.3 \u00b1 0.6; P <.0001) and there was significant improvement in peak oxygen uptake (pre 54% \u00b1 18% vs post 66% \u00b1 22%; P =.02). Conclusions Cone reconstruction of TV offers an effective repair in patients with severe regurgitation associated with Ebstein's anomaly. The patients' clinical status improved with better left ventricle filling and objective exercise capacity. The durability of repair, and mechanisms by which the ventricles adapt to the new loading conditions, need longer-term study.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Cardiac Valve Annuloplasty", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Ebstein Anomaly", "Exercise Test", "Exercise Tolerance", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Recovery of Function", "Retrospective Studies", "Severity of Illness Index", "Suture Techniques", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Tricuspid Valve", "Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Ventricular Function, Right", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928210813", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57203520009": {"Name": "Ibrahim M.", "AuthorID": "57203520009", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Heart Hospital"}, "56466227600": {"Name": "Tsang V.T.", "AuthorID": "56466227600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "7402467863": {"Name": "Hughes M.L.", "AuthorID": "7402467863", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Heart Hospital"}, "56523284800": {"Name": "Jenkyns S.", "AuthorID": "56523284800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "56076204000": {"Name": "Perdreau E.", "AuthorID": "56076204000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7006043205": {"Name": "Giardini A.", "AuthorID": "7006043205", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "17635293700": {"Name": "Marek J.", "AuthorID": "17635293700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "55360937200": {"Name": "Caruana M.", "AuthorID": "55360937200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Heart Hospital"}}}
