In this work, we propose a new acquisition and processing scheme. Contrary to existing retrieval methods for EI, which require as input two images acquired in different setup configurations, the proposed approach can retrieve an approximate map of the X-ray phase from a single image, thus significantly simplifying the acquisition procedure and reducing data collection times. Methods The retrieval method is analytically derived, based on the assumption of a quasi-homogeneous object, i.e. an object featuring a constant ratio between refractive index and absorption coefficient. The noise properties of the input and retrieved images are also theoretically analyzed under the developed formalism. The method is applied to experimental synchrotron images of a biological object. Results The experimental results show that the method can provide high-quality images, where the \u201cedge\u201d signal typical of XPCI images is transformed to an \u201carea\u201d contrast that enables an easier interpretation of the sample geometry. Moreover, the retrieved images confirm that the method is highly stable against noise. Conclusions We anticipate that the developed approach will become the method of choice for a variety of applications of EI XPCI, thanks to its ability to simplify the acquisition procedure and reduce acquisitions time and dose to the sample. Future work will focus on the adaptation of the method to computed tomography and to polychromatic radiation from X-ray tubes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Edge illumination", "Fast imaging", "Phase retrieval", "Phase-contrast imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Lighting", "Radiography", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Synchrotrons", "Wood", "X-Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009227803", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35733519000": {"Name": "Di\u00e9moz P.C.", "AuthorID": "35733519000", "AffiliationID": "112946654", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "55320675800": {"Name": "Vittoria F.A.", "AuthorID": "55320675800", "AffiliationID": "112946654", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.K.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "112946654", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.K.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "6701464571": {"Name": "Coan P.", "AuthorID": "6701464571", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University"}, "7003905715": {"Name": "Bravin A.", "AuthorID": "7003905715", "AffiliationID": "60032633", "AffiliationName": "European Synchrotron Radiation Facility"}, "36103067800": {"Name": "Wagner U.H.", "AuthorID": "36103067800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source"}, "57205077339": {"Name": "Rau C.", "AuthorID": "57205077339", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source"}}}
