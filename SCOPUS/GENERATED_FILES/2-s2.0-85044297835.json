ISPs have the opportunity to deploy private edge-clouds in their infrastructure to generate additional revenue by providing ultra-low latency applications to local users. We envision a rapid increase in the number of such applications for 'edge' networks in the near future with virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), networked gaming, wearable cognitive assistance, autonomous driving and IoT analytics having already been proposed for edge- clouds instead of the central clouds to improve performance. This raises new challenges as the complexity of the resource allocation problem for multiple services with latency deadlines (i.e., which service to place at which node of the edge-cloud in order to satisfy the latency constraints) becomes significant. In this paper, we propose a set of practical, uncoordinated strategies for service placement in edge-clouds. Through extensive simulations using both synthetic and real-world trace data, we demonstrate that uncoordinated strategies can perform comparatively well with the optimal placement solution, which satisfies the maximum amount of user requests.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cache management", "Distributed service placement", "Edge computing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cache management", "Cognitive assistance", "Distributed service", "Extensive simulations", "Improve performance", "Latency constraints", "Optimal placement solutions", "Resource allocation problem"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044297835", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"]], "AuthorData": {"25926838500": {"Name": "Ascigil O.", "AuthorID": "25926838500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}, "55234792400": {"Name": "Phan T.", "AuthorID": "55234792400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}, "55361226700": {"Name": "Tasiopoulos A.", "AuthorID": "55361226700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}, "15726695000": {"Name": "Sourlas V.", "AuthorID": "15726695000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}, "16048105300": {"Name": "Psaras I.", "AuthorID": "16048105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}}}
