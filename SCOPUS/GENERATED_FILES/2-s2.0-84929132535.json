Materials and Methods An electronic survey was sent to UK pelvic cancer centers regarding: (1) choice of NAC regimen; (2) indications for reimaging; (3) choice and indication of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for patients with nodal disease after NAC and RC; (4) choice and indication of chemotherapy regimen if disease continues to progress in patients with advanced bladder cancer; and (5) guidelines used by those surveyed. Results Consultant uro-oncologists from 77% of UK pelvic cancer centers responded, who treated a median of 13 patients per year with NAC before RC. Three cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin was the most common NAC regimen, with 93% and 67% respondents giving it for downstaging of cN1- and cN2- and 3-positive patients, respectively. Forty-five percent would not give AC after NAC and RC in patients with positive lymph nodes. The patient's performance status, followed by response to NAC were key factors in dictating the use of AC. In the presence of disease progression, 46% of participants would use a taxane. Fifty-two percent of responders do not follow any guidelines. Conclusion In the United Kingdom, the treatment of patients with nodal disease after NAC and RC is variable. There is little evidence on which to base the management of such patients. The creation of national and international guidelines might help clinicians to optimize care for these patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lymph node", "Muscle invasive bladder cancer", "Transitional cell carcinoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Cisplatin", "Cystectomy", "Deoxycytidine", "Great Britain", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Treatment Outcome", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929132535", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57201942956": {"Name": "Tan W.S.", "AuthorID": "57201942956", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London Medical School, University College London"}, "30467833700": {"Name": "Lamb B.W.", "AuthorID": "30467833700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "55463734200": {"Name": "Green J.S.A.", "AuthorID": "55463734200", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health and Social Care, London Southbank University"}, "7005709693": {"Name": "Payne H.", "AuthorID": "7005709693", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London Hospitals"}, "56468627300": {"Name": "Hughes S.", "AuthorID": "56468627300", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, Guy's Hospital"}, "7101662118": {"Name": "Lane T.", "AuthorID": "7101662118", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire and South Bedfordshire Urological Cancer Centre, Department of Urology, Lister Hospital"}, "6701383507": {"Name": "Adshead J.", "AuthorID": "6701383507", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire and South Bedfordshire Urological Cancer Centre, Department of Urology, Lister Hospital"}, "6603402083": {"Name": "Boustead G.", "AuthorID": "6603402083", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire and South Bedfordshire Urological Cancer Centre, Department of Urology, Lister Hospital"}, "24492450100": {"Name": "Vasdev N.", "AuthorID": "24492450100", "AffiliationID": "60027616", "AffiliationName": "Hertfordshire and South Bedfordshire Urological Cancer Centre, Department of Urology, Lister Hospital"}}}
