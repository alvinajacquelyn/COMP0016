KGaA, Weinheim.Purpose: We have previously demonstrated associations between the urinary proteome profile and coronary artery disease (CAD) in cross-sectional studies. Here, we evaluate the potential of a urinary proteomic panel as a predictor of CAD in the hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HACVD) substudy population of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial study. Experimental design: Thirty-seven cases with primary CAD endpoint were matched for sex and age to controls who had not reached a CAD endpoint during the study. Spot urine samples were analyzed using CE coupled to Micro-TOF MS. A previously developed 238-marker CE-MS model for diagnosis of CAD (CAD238) was assessed for its predictive potential. Results: Sixty urine samples (32 cases; 28 controls; 88% male, mean age 64 \u00b1 5 years) were analyzed. There was a trend toward healthier values in controls for the CAD model classifier (-0.432 \u00b1 0.326 versus -0.587 \u00b1 0.297, p = 0.170), and the CAD model showed statistical significance on Kaplan-Meier survival analysis p = 0.021. We found 190 individual markers out of 1501 urinary peptides that separated cases and controls (AUC >0.6). Of these, 25 peptides were also components of CAD238. Conclusion and clinical relevance: A urinary proteome panel originally developed in a cross-sectional study predicts CAD endpoints independent of age and sex in a well-controlled prospective study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarker", "Cardiovascular risk", "Urinary proteomics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Atherosclerosis", "Biomarkers", "Case-Control Studies", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Prospective Studies", "Proteome", "Proteomics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930928194", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"]], "AuthorData": {"56645352900": {"Name": "Brown C.E.", "AuthorID": "56645352900", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "14023613000": {"Name": "Stalmach A.", "AuthorID": "14023613000", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7003512289": {"Name": "Mullen W.", "AuthorID": "7003512289", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "57203682077": {"Name": "Dominiczak A.F.", "AuthorID": "57203682077", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7007043802": {"Name": "Sattar N.", "AuthorID": "7007043802", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "7004897973": {"Name": "Mischak H.", "AuthorID": "7004897973", "AffiliationID": "112575055", "AffiliationName": "Mosaiques Diagnostics"}, "7004220876": {"Name": "Delles C.", "AuthorID": "7004220876", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular and Medical Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "56540921200": {"Name": "McCarthy N.S.", "AuthorID": "56540921200", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "University of Western Australia"}, "56035382000": {"Name": "Stanton A.V.", "AuthorID": "56035382000", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "35370752300": {"Name": "Sever P.", "AuthorID": "35370752300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "35420719100": {"Name": "Thom S.", "AuthorID": "35420719100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "7006017382": {"Name": "Mayet J.", "AuthorID": "7006017382", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}}}
