It broadly divides into four sections: spinal embryology anatomy and physiology; diagnosis of spinal column and cord disorders; specific diseases of the spinal column and spinal cord, and clinical management including medical and surgical approaches. The chapter discusses conditions that have yielded insight into spinal cord maldevelopment. Consideration of the details of Klippel-Feil syndrome, X-linked Kallmann syndrome and congenital hemiplegia pathophysiology has led to a wider appreciation of corticospinal tract development. The chapter focuses on symptoms and physical signs that are of particular value in helping the experienced clinician achieve an accurate and timely diagnosis and an assessment that allows a coherent plan of management to be formulated. Surgical detethering may treat a tethered cord in a patient with progressive neurological symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Klippel-Feil syndrome", "Neuro-genetics disorder", "Neuro-infection", "Neuro-inflammation disorder", "Neuro-muscular disorder", "Neuro-rehabilitation disorder", "Spinal column disorder", "Spinal cord disorder", "X-linked Kallmann syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024896235", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7103161316": {"Name": "Farmer S.", "AuthorID": "7103161316", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "23049327300": {"Name": "Choi D.", "AuthorID": "23049327300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
