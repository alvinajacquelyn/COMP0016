In 4 experiments, participants reported their aesthetic preferences regarding a variety of targets (pictures, movements, objects, and letters). Experiments 1, 2, and 3 manipulatedpower and motor fluency (via motoric resonance, extraocular muscle training, and dominant hand restriction). Experiment 4 manipulated power and assessed chronic interindividual differences in motor fluency. Across these experiments, power consistently increased reliance on motor fluency in aesthetic preference judgments. This finding was not mediated by differences in mood, judgment certainty, perceived task-demands or task-enjoyment, and derived from the use of motor simulations rather than from power differences in the acquisition of motor experiences. This is the first demonstration suggesting that power changes the formation of preference judgments as a function of motor fluency experiences. The implications of this research for the links between power and action, as well as the understanding of fluency processes are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fluency", "Motor and muscular ease", "Power", "Preferences", "Subjective experiences"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Esthetics", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Power (Psychology)", "Visual Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941702181", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"23111563100": {"Name": "Woltin K.A.", "AuthorID": "23111563100", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London, and Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique"}, "17345779900": {"Name": "Guinote A.", "AuthorID": "17345779900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
