In this article, we adopt an analytical framework based on an ethic of care to critique the registration of land as a \u2018town or village green\u2019, using the example of an inquiry into the greens status of an ancient woodland. Analysing written and oral witness statements in this inquiry makes clear the centrality of such places in many people\u2019s lives, giving rise to community-based, and forward-looking, interests. However, the legal focus upon quantitative assessments of individuals\u2019 use of land in the recent past means that the prospective consequences of losing such valued areas are currently poorly acknowledged, and accounted for, in the registration process. This leads to the question whether an ethic of care towards everyday shared spaces may be better recognised via more deliberative plan-making regimes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deliberative theories", "ethic of care", "everyday shared spaces", "feminist theories", "knowledge claims", "local greens", "witness statements"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068818723", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"55922704400": {"Name": "Holder J.", "AuthorID": "55922704400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7003604217": {"Name": "McGillivray D.", "AuthorID": "7003604217", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "University of Sussex"}}}
