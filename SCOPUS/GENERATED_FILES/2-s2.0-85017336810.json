Design Cross-sectional observational study. Participants One hundred nineteen children 2 to 16 years of age (mean age, 9.4 years; standard deviation [SD], 4.56 years) with glaucoma and their parents. Methods Completion of 3 validated instruments for children to assess (1) functional visual ability (FVA) with the Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children (CVAQC), (2) VR QoL with the Impact of Vision Impairment for Children (IVI-C), and (3) HR QoL with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) version 4.0. Main Outcome Measures Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children, IVI-C, and PedsQL scores. Results Scores for FVA, VR QoL, and HR QoL were reduced in children with glaucoma: median CVAQC score, \u20131.24 (interquartile range [IQR], \u20132.2 to \u20130.11; range, \u20133.00 higher visual ability to +2.80 lower visual ability); mean IVI-C score, 67.3 (SD, 14.4; normal VR QoL, 96); median PedsQL self-report, 78.8 (IQR, 67.4\u201390.2); parent report, 71.2 (IQR, 55.7\u201385.8); and family impact score, 74.3 (IQR, 56.9\u201388.5; normal HR QoL, 100). Psychosocial subscores were lower than physical subscores on the PedsQL. Older children reported less impairment on CVAQC, IVI-C, and PedsQL than younger children. Parents reported greater impact on their child's HR QoL than children reported themselves. Conclusions Glaucoma and its management have a marked impact on a child's FVA and QoL. Children with glaucoma report HR QoL scores similar to those described by children with severe congenital cardiac defects, who have undergone liver transplants, or who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Self Report", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017336810", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"22950013600": {"Name": "Dahlmann-Noor A.", "AuthorID": "22950013600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55281650200": {"Name": "Tailor V.", "AuthorID": "55281650200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, University College London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care & Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "12753169100": {"Name": "Abou-Rayyah Y.", "AuthorID": "12753169100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Adnexal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55463366200": {"Name": "Adams G.", "AuthorID": "55463366200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005183974": {"Name": "Brookes J.", "AuthorID": "7005183974", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7101944790": {"Name": "Papadopoulos M.", "AuthorID": "7101944790", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
