All rights reserved.Purpose: This study aims to examine the clear speaking strategies used by older children when interacting with a peer with hearing loss, focusing on both acoustic and linguistic adaptations in speech. Method: The Grid task, a problem-solving task developed to elicit spontaneous interactive speech, was used to obtain a range of global acoustic and linguistic measures. Eighteen 9- to 14-year-old children with normal hearing (NH) performed the task in pairs, once with a friend with NH and once with a friend with a hearing impairment (HI). Results: In HI-directed speech, children increased their fundamental frequency range and midfrequency intensity, decreased the number of words per phrase, and expanded their vowel space area by increasing F1 and F2 range, relative to NH-directed speech. However, participants did not appear to make changes to their articulation rate, the lexical frequency of content words, or lexical diversity when talking to their friend with HI compared with their friend with NH. Conclusions: Older children show evidence of listener-oriented adaptations to their speech production; although their speech production systems are still developing, they are able to make speech adaptations to benefit the needs of a peer with HI, even without being given a specific instruction to do so.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Psychological", "Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Female", "Friends", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Peer Group", "Problem Solving", "Psycholinguistics", "Speech", "Speech Production Measurement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047265991", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"55066440800": {"Name": "Granlund S.", "AuthorID": "55066440800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hearing & Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "6603725233": {"Name": "Hazan V.", "AuthorID": "6603725233", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Hearing & Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "57195445271": {"Name": "Mahon M.", "AuthorID": "57195445271", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Language & Cognition, University College London"}}}
