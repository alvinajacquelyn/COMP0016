However, her analysis fails to acknowledge the central role that states play in initiating and orchestrating acts of war. I argue that states are corporate moral agents, who are morally responsible for their own wrongdoings during an unjust war, and that this argument is compatible with Fabre\u2019s cosmopolitan premises. I then suggest that a systematic account of criminal liability in the aftermath of a war should acknowledge the role that states play in orchestrating wars and committing war crimes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068974998", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"26021997900": {"Name": "Pasternak A.", "AuthorID": "26021997900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The School of Public Policy, University College London"}}}
