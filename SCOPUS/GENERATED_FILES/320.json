These methodological issues have been acknowledged as limitations in most of the existing research, but they have not been explored as being potentially serious flaws contributing to the proliferation of myth, or as aggravating factors that exacerbate what is essentially a relatively uncomplicated social process. Also unclear from existing studies is the extent to which suppositions about gangs feed moral panics or contribute to the misidentification or over-specification of a problem. This captivating volume focuses on gangs, their formation, identity and behaviour with a view to developing a preventive strategy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086196781", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"57217500824": {"Name": "Schneider J.", "AuthorID": "57217500824", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Criminology, University of Leicester"}, "6602765847": {"Name": "Tilley N.", "AuthorID": "6602765847", "AffiliationID": "60006029, 60022148, 60090044", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Trent University, Jill Dando Institute of Crime Science, University College London"}}}
