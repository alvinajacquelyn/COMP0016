Lately, due to the availability of a large number of bug reports, a considerable amount of research has been carried out on bug-report analysis, such as automatically checking duplication of bug reports and localizing bugs based on bug reports. To review the work on bug-report analysis, this paper presents an exhaustive survey on the existing work on bug-report analysis. In particular, this paper first presents some background for bug reports and gives a small empirical study on the bug reports on Bugzilla to motivate the necessity for work on bug-report analysis. Then this paper summaries the existing work on bug-report analysis and points out some possible problems in working with bug-report analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bug fixing", "bug localization", "bug report", "bug-report analysis", "bug-report triage", "survey"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bug localizations", "Bug reports", "Bug-fixing", "Empirical studies", "Software artifacts", "Software bug"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921334011", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36505536200": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "36505536200", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Ministry of Education"}, "23388889700": {"Name": "Hao D.", "AuthorID": "23388889700", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Ministry of Education"}, "7201872787": {"Name": "Xie B.", "AuthorID": "7201872787", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Ministry of Education"}, "56275778800": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "56275778800", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Ministry of Education"}, "7103007678": {"Name": "Mei H.", "AuthorID": "7103007678", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Ministry of Education"}, "55837728600": {"Name": "Wang X.Y.", "AuthorID": "55837728600", "AffiliationID": "60003212", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Texas at San Antonio"}}}
