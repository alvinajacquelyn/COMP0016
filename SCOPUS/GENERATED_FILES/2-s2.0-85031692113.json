Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of 238 male nursing home veterans in Hawaii. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis identified groups based on 25 (OH) D and vitamin D supplementation for frailty risk. Characteristics were examined and compared across the groups using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Results: CART analysis identified three distinct groups: vitamin D supplement users (n = 86), non-users with low vitamin D (n = 55), and non-users with high vitamin D (n = 97). Supplement users were the most frail, but had high mean 25 (OH) D of 26.6 ng/mL, which was compatible with 27.1 ng/mL in non-users with high vitamin D, while mean 25 (OH) D of non-users with low vitamin D was 11.7 ng/mL. Supplement users and non-users with low vitamin D were significantly more likely to be frail (odds ratio (OR) = 9.90, 95% CI = 2.18-44.86, p = 0.003; OR = 4.28, 95% CI = 1.44-12.68, p = 0.009, respectively), compared with non-users with low vitamin D. ROC curve analysis showed the three groups significantly predicted frailty (area under the curve = 0.73), with sensitivity of 64.4% and specificity of 76.7%, while 25 (OH) D did not predict frailty. Conclusions: In these nursing home veterans, vitamin D supplement users were the most frail but with high 25 (OH) D. This can potentially be a cause of U-shaped associations between vitamin D levels and negative health outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Frailty", "Nursing home", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D deficiency", "Vitamin D supplementation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Decision Trees", "Dietary Supplements", "Frail Elderly", "Frailty", "Homes for the Aged", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nursing Homes", "Regression Analysis", "Veterans", "Veterans Health", "Vitamin D"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031692113", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"55224802200": {"Name": "Kojima G.", "AuthorID": "55224802200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7201602357": {"Name": "Tanabe M.", "AuthorID": "7201602357", "AffiliationID": "60014232", "AffiliationName": "Veterans Affairs Pacific Islands Health Care System"}}}
