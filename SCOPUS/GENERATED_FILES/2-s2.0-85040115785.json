Benzodiazepines and their derivatives are one of a number of groups of these substances and thus far their number has grown year upon year. For both forensic and clinical purposes it is important to be able to rapidly understand these emerging substances. However as a consequence of the illicit nature of these compounds, there is a deficiency in the pharmacological data available for these \u2018new\u2019 benzodiazepines. In order to further understand the pharmacology of \u2018new\u2019 benzodiazepines we utilised a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) approach. A set of 69 benzodiazepine-based compounds was analysed to develop a QSAR training set with respect to published binding values to GABAA receptors. The QSAR model returned an R2 value of 0.90. The most influential factors were found to be the positioning of two H-bond acceptors, two aromatic rings and a hydrophobic group. A test set of nine random compounds was then selected for internal validation to determine the predictive ability of the model and gave an R2 value of 0.86 when comparing the binding values with their experimental data. The QSAR model was then used to predict the binding for 22 benzodiazepines that are classed as new psychoactive substances. This model will allow rapid prediction of the binding activity of emerging benzodiazepines in a rapid and economic way, compared with lengthy and expensive in vitro/in vivo analysis. This will enable forensic chemists and toxicologists to better understand both recently developed compounds and prediction of substances likely to emerge in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benzodiazepines", "Biological activity", "GABAA receptor", "New psychoactive substances", "Prediction", "QSAR"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benzodiazepines", "Binding Sites", "Humans", "Models, Chemical", "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship", "Receptors, GABA-A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040115785", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"35863663400": {"Name": "Waters L.", "AuthorID": "35863663400", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Sciences, University of Huddersfield"}, "57195240110": {"Name": "Manchester K.R.", "AuthorID": "57195240110", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Sciences, University of Huddersfield"}, "36947290700": {"Name": "Maskell P.D.", "AuthorID": "36947290700", "AffiliationID": "60001903", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, Engineering and Technology, Abertay University"}, "57200192930": {"Name": "Haegeman C.", "AuthorID": "57200192930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57196221455": {"Name": "Haider S.", "AuthorID": "57196221455", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
