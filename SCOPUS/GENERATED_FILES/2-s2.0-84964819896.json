Process model variants can be attributed to any of the following reasons: new technologies, governmental rules, organizational context or adoption of new standards. Current approaches to manage variants of process models address issues such as reducing the huge effort of modeling from scratch, preventing redundancy, and controlling inconsistency in process models. Although the effort to manage process model variants has been exerted, there are still limitations. Furthermore, existing approaches do not focus on variants that come from change in organizational perspective of process models. Organizational-driven variant management is an important area that still needs more study that we focus on in this paper. Resource Assignment Matrix (RAM) is an important aspect of the organizational perspective that has different variations. This paper introduces an approach inspired by real life scenario to generate consistent process model variants that come from adaptations in the RAM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Business process management (BPM)", "Organizational-Driven variant", "Process-Aware information systems (PAISs)", "RACI variants", "Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Business process management", "Organizational-Driven variant", "Process-aware information systems", "RACI variants", "Responsibility assignment matrix (RAM)"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964819896", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55892420500": {"Name": "Tealeb A.", "AuthorID": "55892420500", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Information Systems Department, Cairo University"}, "57189881011": {"Name": "Awad A.", "AuthorID": "57189881011", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Information Systems Department, Cairo University"}, "14051997800": {"Name": "Galal-Edeen G.", "AuthorID": "14051997800", "AffiliationID": "60010294", "AffiliationName": "Information Systems Department, Cairo University"}}}
