We compute the ro-vibrational energy levels and their associated wavefunctions together with Einstein coefficients for electric dipole transitions. A detailed analysis of the stability of the ro-vibrational states has been carried out and the longest-living states of the hydronium ions have been identified. We report estimated radiative lifetimes and cooling functions for temperatures <200 K. A number of long-living meta-stable states are identified, capable of population trapping.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988624288", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"7004349920": {"Name": "Melnikov V.", "AuthorID": "7004349920", "AffiliationID": "60016896", "AffiliationName": "Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology, Tomsk State University"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7402089078": {"Name": "Jensen P.", "AuthorID": "7402089078", "AffiliationID": "60022995", "AffiliationName": "Physikalische und Theoretische Chemie, Fakult\u00e4t f\u00fcr Mathematik und Naturwissenschaften, Bergische Universit\u00e4t Wuppertal"}}}
