However, due to incomplete understanding, existing models used for concrete are essentially empirical and lack rational basis. This limits their predictive capability and applicability range. In this paper, fundamental thermodynamics and continuum mechanics laws are used to obtain an expression that quantitatively predicts the effects of stress on the coefficient of thermal expansion. The newly-defined thermal expansion coefficient is then used to develop a rational model, which is shown to be capable of reliably quantifying the coupling effects of stress and temperature change. Good agreement between the model predictions, available data and observations is obtained. Equally important, all parameters of the developed model can be determined using simple tests. This enables a wide adoption of the model in practical engineering applications. While this paper uses data for concrete, the proposed model is developed from first principles and using fundamental physical laws. The model should thus be applicable to a wide range of solid materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coupling effects", "Fundamental physical laws", "Hooke's law", "Load-induced thermal strain", "Thermal expansion coefficient"], "IndexKeywords": ["Coupling effect", "Hooke's Law", "Physical laws", "Thermal expansion coefficients", "Thermal strain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066337419", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57197809105": {"Name": "Le Q.", "AuthorID": "57197809105", "AffiliationID": "60071357", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Civil Engineering, The University of Danang, University of Science and Technology"}, "35261807300": {"Name": "Dao V.", "AuthorID": "35261807300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
