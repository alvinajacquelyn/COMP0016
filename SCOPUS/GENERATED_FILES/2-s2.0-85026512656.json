Additionally, we have explored the impact of beam damage inducing redox alterations. Polymer nanoparticles were tested against films to produce higher concentration samples while maintaining high surface area to bulk effects. Spectra from nanoparticles were highly comparable to thin films of ~8 nm thickness, implying comparable contributions by surface effects on copper association. Finally, we observed no impact on Cu XANES spectra from vitrification with dimethyl sulfoxide to produce amorphous frozen, hydrated samples. The spectra should act as a valuable resource in assisting the design of experiments and identification of copper associations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anti-biofouling", "Cu-K edge XANES", "nanoparticles", "polymers", "thin films"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-biofouling", "Bulk effect", "High surface area", "Polymer nanoparticles", "Surface effect", "X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy", "XANES", "XANES spectra"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026512656", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55802371548": {"Name": "Larsson M.", "AuthorID": "55802371548", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": null}, "56205116300": {"Name": "Lind\u00e9n J.", "AuthorID": "56205116300", "AffiliationID": "60107281", "AffiliationName": null}, "56708087400": {"Name": "Kaur S.", "AuthorID": "56708087400", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": null}, "57195245981": {"Name": "Le Cerf B.", "AuthorID": "57195245981", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": null}, "6602311016": {"Name": "Kempson I.", "AuthorID": "6602311016", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": null}}}
