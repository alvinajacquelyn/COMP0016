Materials capable of affecting the MSC oxygen-sensing pathway, independently of the environmental oxygen pressure, are therefore of immense interest to the tissue engineering (TE) and regenerative medicine community. In this study, we describe the evaluation of the effect of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-stabilizing bioactive glasses (BGs) on human MSCs. The dissolution products from these hypoxia-mimicking BGs stabilized HIF-1\u03b1 in a concentration-dependent manner, altered cell proliferation and metabolism, and upregulated a number of genes involved in the hypoxic response (HIF1A, HIF2A, and VHL), MSC survival (SAG and BCL2), extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP1), and angiogenesis (VEGF and PDGF). These HIF-stabilizing materials can therefore be used to improve MSC survival and enhance regeneration in a number of TE strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Concentration-dependent manners", "Dissolution products", "Extracellular matrix remodeling", "Hypoxia-inducible factors", "Mesenchymal stem cell", "Oxygen pressure", "Regenerative medicine", "Stabilizing materials", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Survival", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Glass", "Humans", "Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Protein Stability", "Signal Transduction", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921395895", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"7006890497": {"Name": "Azevedo M.", "AuthorID": "7006890497", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "8399785100": {"Name": "Tsigkou O.", "AuthorID": "8399785100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57214410354": {"Name": "Nair R.", "AuthorID": "57214410354", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Royal Free Medical School, University College London"}, "7408055653": {"Name": "Jones J.", "AuthorID": "7408055653", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London, South Kensington Campus"}, "8399784800": {"Name": "Jell G.", "AuthorID": "8399784800", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, Royal Free Medical School, University College London"}, "7402243195": {"Name": "Stevens M.", "AuthorID": "7402243195", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioengineering, Imperial College London"}}}
