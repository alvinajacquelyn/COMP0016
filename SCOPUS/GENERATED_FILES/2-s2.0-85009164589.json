It is shown that if nth-order SMO is used, either super-twisting algorithm structure is not achieved using continuous controller or the resulting controller is discontinuous. The discontinuous control action is not desirable for practical applications. A method for implementing STC using (n+1) th-order SMO is proposed. The controller proposed based on this observer design is continuous. Sliding surface is designed for handling relative degree problem and the controller is designed such that second order sliding mode (SOSM) is achieved on the sliding surface. Simulation results are also shown using practical example of Insulin-Glucose regulation dynamical model to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Higher order integrator system", "Higher order sliding mode observer", "Super-twisting control"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous controller", "Discontinuous control", "Glucose regulation", "Higher order sliding modes", "Integrator systems", "Second order sliding mode (SOSM)", "Super twisting algorithm", "Super twisting controls"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009164589", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"57189688059": {"Name": "Kumari K.", "AuthorID": "57189688059", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "Systems and Control Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"}, "55368137300": {"Name": "Chalanga A.", "AuthorID": "55368137300", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "Systems and Control Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"}, "7102126899": {"Name": "Bandyopadhyay B.", "AuthorID": "7102126899", "AffiliationID": "60014153", "AffiliationName": "Systems and Control Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"}}}
