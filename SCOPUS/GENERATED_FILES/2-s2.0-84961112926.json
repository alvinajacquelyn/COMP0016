Using data from the National Child Development Study, a nationally representative sample of 17,415 babies born in Great Britain in 1958 and followed up at 11, 33, and 50 years of age. Self-reported diagnosed hypertension by 50 years was the outcome measure. In total, 5753 participants with complete data on parental social class at birth, childhood cognitive ability test scores at 11 years, educational qualifications at 33 years, personality traits, occupational levels, and self-reported hypertension (all measured at age 50 years) were included in the study. Using logistic regression analyses, results showed that sex (OR = 0.60: 0.49\u20130.73, p < .001), educational qualifications (OR = 0.59: 0.37\u20130.92, p < .05), and traits emotional stability (OR = 0.84: 0.77\u20130.91, p < .001) and conscientiousness (OR = 0.89: 0.82\u20130.98, p < .05) were all significantly associated with the occurrence of self-reported hypertension in adulthood. Both psychological factors and socio-demographic factors were significantly associated with self-reported hypertension in adulthood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-sectional and longitudinal", "Educational qualifications", "Self-reported hypertension", "Traits Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961112926", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"55326183500": {"Name": "Cheng H.", "AuthorID": "55326183500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56397159200": {"Name": "Treglown L.", "AuthorID": "56397159200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "BI: Norwegian Business School"}, "57203048203": {"Name": "Montgomery S.", "AuthorID": "57203048203", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, UCL"}}}
