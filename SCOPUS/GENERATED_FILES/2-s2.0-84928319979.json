The aetiological basis of many cardiovascular disorders is not fully understood. Growing knowledge of the genetic architecture underlying coronary heart disease, stroke, cardiac arrhythmias and peripheral vascular disease has confirmed some suspected causal pathways in these conditions but also uncovered many previously unknown mechanisms. Here, we consider the contribution of genetics to the understanding of cardiovascular disease risk. We evaluate the utility and relevance of findings from genome-wide association studies and explore the role that Mendelian randomisation has to play in exploiting these. Mendelian randomisation permits robust causal inference in an area of research where this has been hampered by bias and confounding in observational studies. In doing so, it provides evidence for causal processes in cardiovascular disease that could represent novel targets for much-needed new drugs for disease prevention and treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiovascular disease", "Causal inference", "Genetics", "Mendelian randomisation", "Risk factors", "Risk prediction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Mendelian Randomization Analysis", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928319979", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"35977230000": {"Name": "Swerdlow D.I.", "AuthorID": "35977230000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005545809": {"Name": "Hingorani A.D.", "AuthorID": "7005545809", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
