A suitable feature based on singular value decomposition of the spectrograms is proposed and tested with different types of classifiers. It is shown that high accuracy of between 97 and 99% can be achieved when multistatic data are used to perform the classification.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Feature-based", "High-accuracy", "Micro-Doppler", "Multi-static", "Spectrograms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949783875", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55574564400": {"Name": "Fioranelli F.", "AuthorID": "55574564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College"}}}
