We focus on the transition from school to work, using a representative sample of youths leaving the French educational system in 1998 and 2004. We identify the causal effect of local employment rate using a neighbourhood fixed-effect strategy (Bayer et al, 2007). We provide evidence that the within-neighbourhood random allocation assumption is likely to hold. The results show that an individual's own employment is strongly affected by the share of working people in their neighbourhood, estimates being higher for high-school dropouts. Results also reveal gender differences, suggesting that young people are more sensitive to same-sex neighbours.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Female employment.", "Local social interactions", "Neighbourhood effects", "Unemployment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057799185", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"57189626786": {"Name": "Solignac M.", "AuthorID": "57189626786", "AffiliationID": "60033423", "AffiliationName": "Institut National d'\u00c9tudes D\u00e9mographiques (INED)"}, "57189620404": {"Name": "T\u00f4 M.", "AuthorID": "57189620404", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College of London (UCL), Department of Economics"}}}
