All rights reserved.Chemotaxis, or directed motion in chemical gradients, is critical for various biological processes. Many eukaryotic cells perform spatial sensing, i.e. they detect gradients by comparing spatial differences in binding occupancy of chemosensory receptors across their membrane. In many theoretical models of spatial sensing, it is assumed, for the sake of simplicity, that the receptors concerned do not move. However, in reality, receptors undergo diverse modes of diffusion, and can traverse considerable distances in the time it takes such cells to turn in an external gradient. This sets a physical limit on the accuracy of spatial sensing, which we explore using a model in which receptors diffuse freely over the membrane. We find that the Fisher information carried in binding and unbinding events decreases monotonically with the diffusion constant of the receptors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemotaxis", "Fisher information", "Receptor diffusion", "Spatial sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological process", "Chemical gradients", "Chemosensory receptors", "Chemotaxis", "Diffusion constant", "Fisher information", "Spatial differences", "Spatial sensing", "Algorithms", "Breast", "Chemotaxis", "Computer Simulation", "Diffusion", "Epithelial Cells", "Female", "Humans", "Likelihood Functions", "Lipid Bilayers", "Lipids", "Membrane Microdomains", "Models, Theoretical", "Poisson Distribution", "Reproducibility of Results", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989170179", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57209589548": {"Name": "Nguyen H.", "AuthorID": "57209589548", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute, University of Queensland"}, "7004664339": {"Name": "Goodhill G.J.", "AuthorID": "7004664339", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Physics, University of Queensland"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL"}}}
