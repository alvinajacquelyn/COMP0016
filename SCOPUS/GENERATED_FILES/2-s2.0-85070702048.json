Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground/aims: Non-invasive fibrosis tests (NITs) can be used to triage non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients at risk of advanced fibrosis (AF). We modelled and investigated the diagnostic accuracy and costs of a two-tier NIT approach in primary care (PC) to inform secondary care referrals (SCRs). Methods: A hypothetical cohort of 1,000 NAFLD patients with a 5% prevalence of AF was examined. Three referral strategies were modelled: refer all patients (Scenario 1), refer only patients with AF on NITs performed in PC (Scenario 2) and refer those with AF after biopsy (Scenario 3). Patients in Scenarios 1 and 2 would undergo sequential NITs if their initial NIT was indeterminate (FIB-4 followed by Fibroscan\u00ae, enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF)\u00ae or FibroTest\u00ae). The outcomes considered were true/false positives and true/false negatives with associated mortality, complications, treatment and follow-up depending on the care setting. Decision curve analysis was performed, which expressed the net benefit of different scenarios over a range of threshold probabilities (Pt). Results: Sequential use of NITs provided lower SCR rates and greater cost savings compared to other scenarios over 5 years, with 90% of patients managed in PC and cost savings of over 40%. On decision curve analysis, FIB-4 plus ELF was marginally superior to FIB-4 plus Fibroscan at Pt \u22658% (1/12.5 referrals). Below this Pt, FIB-4 plus Fibroscan had greater net benefit. The net reduction in SCRs was similar for both sequential combinations. Conclusions: The sequential use of NITs in PC is an effective way to rationalize SCRs and is associated with significant cost savings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["enhanced liver fibrosis", "FIB-4", "Fibroscan", "FibroTest"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cohort Studies", "Costs and Cost Analysis", "Critical Pathways", "Decision Support Techniques", "Elasticity Imaging Techniques", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Liver Function Tests", "Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease", "Primary Health Care", "Referral and Consultation", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070702048", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"55964710100": {"Name": "Crossan C.", "AuthorID": "55964710100", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics Research Group, Brunel University"}, "6602368778": {"Name": "Longworth L.", "AuthorID": "6602368778", "AffiliationID": "60118297", "AffiliationName": "PHMR Limited"}, "56623900700": {"Name": "Majumdar A.", "AuthorID": "56623900700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health and Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "57014022200": {"Name": "Srivastava A.", "AuthorID": "57014022200", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health and Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "55217322300": {"Name": "Thorburn D.", "AuthorID": "55217322300", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health and Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "35374746300": {"Name": "Rosenberg W.", "AuthorID": "35374746300", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health and Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "7005412715": {"Name": "Pinzani M.", "AuthorID": "7005412715", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health and Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.A.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health and Sheila Sherlock Liver Unit, Royal Free Hospital and UCL"}}}
