It describes the 1 g laboratory model developed at University College London. The test pile consists of a hollow stainless steel tube which is instrumented using Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors that allow measurement of strain and temperature profiles along the pile length and the surrounding soil. The pile is subjected to two heating-cooling cycles. Water held at 50\u00b0C is circulated inside the pile for 24 hours; this is followed by a 24-hour cooling period during which the temperature of the water is allowed to fall back to ambient conditions. The results show that small irreversible settlements occurred during this period. Additionally, it is found that the degree of freedom varies between 0.9 and 1.0 which indicate low levels of restraint are present. Nevertheless, considerable axial load and axial stress is induced in the pile. Moreover, significant shaft friction is mobilized during both heating and cooling periods.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Fibre Bragg grating sensors", "Heating and cooling cycles", "Heating and cooling periods", "Heating-cooling cycle", "Laboratory investigations", "Stainless steel tube", "Temperature profiles", "University College London"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002411694", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"]], "AuthorData": {"57192254522": {"Name": "Rafiei A.", "AuthorID": "57192254522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57199300154": {"Name": "Arya C.", "AuthorID": "57199300154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7402533269": {"Name": "James S.W.", "AuthorID": "7402533269", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "Cranfield University"}, "56604784200": {"Name": "Correia R.G.", "AuthorID": "56604784200", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "University of Nottingham"}, "35188883400": {"Name": "Fuentes R.", "AuthorID": "35188883400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "University of Leeds"}}}
