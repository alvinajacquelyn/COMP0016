Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of UICC.Photochemical internalisation (PCI) is a technique for improving cellular delivery of certain bioactive agents which are prone to sequestration within endolysosomes. There is a wide range of agents suitable for PCI-based delivery including toxins, oligonucleotides, genes and immunoconjugates which demonstrates the versatility of this technique. The basic mechanism of PCI involves triggering release of the agent from endolysosomes within the target cells using a photosensitiser which is selectively retained with the endolysosomal membranes. Excitation of the photosensitiser by visible light leads to disruption of the membranes via photooxidative damage thereby releasing the agent into the cytosol. This treatment enables the drugs to reach their intended subcellular target more efficiently and improves their efficacy. In this review we summarise the applications of this technique with the main emphasis placed on cancer chemotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chemotherapy", "drug delivery system", "drug resistance", "photochemical internalisation", "photodynamic therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anthracyclines", "Cytotoxins", "Drug Carriers", "Glycopeptides", "Humans", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Neoplasms", "Photochemotherapy", "Photosensitizing Agents", "Ribosome Inactivating Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955698085", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57080096100": {"Name": "De Pinillos Bayona A.M.", "AuthorID": "57080096100", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Charles Bell House"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.M.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Charles Bell House"}, "57204294898": {"Name": "Loizidou M.", "AuthorID": "57204294898", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Charles Bell House"}, "26643365600": {"Name": "MacRobert A.J.", "AuthorID": "26643365600", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Charles Bell House"}, "6602368084": {"Name": "Woodhams J.H.", "AuthorID": "6602368084", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London, Charles Bell House"}}}
