To promote long-lasting motor recovery, these interventions have to be carried out across several weeks or even months. The success of these therapies partly relies on the performance of the system decoding movement intentions, which normally has to be recalibrated to deal with the nonstationarities of the cortical activity. Minimizing the recalibration times is important to reduce the setup preparation and maximize the effective therapy time. To date, a systematic analysis of the effect of recalibration strategies in EEG-driven interfaces for motor rehabilitation has not yet been performed. Data from patients with stroke (4 patients, 8 sessions) and spinal cord injury (SCI) (4 patients, 5 sessions) undergoing two different paradigms (self-paced and cue-guided, respectively) are used to study the performance of the EEG-based classification of motor intentions. Four calibration schemes are compared, considering different combinations of training datasets from previous and/or the validated session. The results show significant differences in classifier performances in terms of the true and false positives (TPs) and (FPs). Combining training data from previous sessions with data from the validation session provides the best compromise between the amount of data needed for calibration and the classifier performance. With this scheme, the average true (false) positive rates obtained are 85.3% (17.3%) and 72.9% (30.3%) for the self-paced and the cue-guided protocols, respectively. These results suggest that the use of optimal recalibration schemes for EEG-based classifiers of motor intentions leads to enhanced performances of these technologies, while not requiring long calibration phases prior to starting the intervention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain-machine interfaces (BMI)", "movement intention", "rehabilitation", "spinal cord injury (SCI)", "stroke"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classifier performance", "Electroencephalographic (EEG)", "Machine interfaces", "Motor rehabilitation", "Movement intentions", "Neurological patient", "Spinal cord injuries (SCI)", "stroke", "Adult", "Aged", "Brain", "Brain-Computer Interfaces", "Calibration", "Cues", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Intention", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Movement Disorders", "Neurological Rehabilitation", "Pattern Recognition, Automated", "Quadriplegia", "Spinal Cord Injuries", "Stroke", "Stroke Rehabilitation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042761715", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"36717787200": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Larraz E.", "AuthorID": "36717787200", "AffiliationID": "60016809", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Investigaci\u00f3n de Ingenier\u00eda de Arag\u00f3n (I3A), Departamento de Inform\u00e1tica e Ingenier\u00eda de Sistemas, University of Zaragoza"}, "6602849539": {"Name": "Montesano L.", "AuthorID": "6602849539", "AffiliationID": "116878753", "AffiliationName": "BitandBrain Technologies SL"}, "57212057392": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez J.", "AuthorID": "57212057392", "AffiliationID": "60022146, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Neural Rehabilitation Group, Cajal Institute, Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)"}, "7202123192": {"Name": "Pons J.L.", "AuthorID": "7202123192", "AffiliationID": "60007966", "AffiliationName": "Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey"}, "55941045600": {"Name": "Trincado-Alonso F.", "AuthorID": "55941045600", "AffiliationID": "60004907", "AffiliationName": "Biomechanics and Technical Aids Unit, Hospital Nacional de Parapl\u00e9jicos"}, "54986295300": {"Name": "Monge-Pereira E.", "AuthorID": "54986295300", "AffiliationID": "60018940", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Fisioterapia Terapia Ocupacional Rehabilitaci\u00f3n y Medicina F\u00edsica, Facultad de CC de la Salud, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos"}}}
