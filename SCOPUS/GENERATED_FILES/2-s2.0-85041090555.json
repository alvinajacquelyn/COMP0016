We previously isolated human W8B2+ cardiac stem cells (CSCs) and found they powerfully influence cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to collectively promote cardiac repair and regeneration. Here, the complexity of the W8B2+ CSC secretomes was characterised and examined in more detail. Using ion exchange chromatography to separate soluble proteins based on their net surface charge, the secreted factors responsible for the pro-survival activity of W8B2+ CSCs were found within the low and medium cation fractions. In addition to the soluble proteins, extracellular vesicles generated from W8B2+ CSCs not only exhibited pro-survival and pro-angiogenic activities, but also promoted proliferation of neonatal cardiomyocytes. These extracellular vesicles contain a cargo of proteins, mRNA and primary microRNA precursors that are enriched in exosomes and are capable of modulating collectively many of the cellular pathways involved in protein metabolism, cell growth, as well as cellular responses to stress and organisation of the extracellular matrix. Thus the W8B2+ CSC secretome contains a multitude of bioactive paracrine factors we have now characterised, that might well be harnessed for therapeutic application for cardiac repair and regeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult Stem Cells", "Animals", "Biological Factors", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Cells, Cultured", "Chromatography, Ion Exchange",
