In this work, supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions has been applied using two different types of excipients, i.e., poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA), to address the precipitation of itraconazole (ITZ) as an amorphous solid. The delivery profiles of the in vitro dissolution tests of the ITZ-GA particles confirmed the advantage of the manufactured amorphous material in terms of apparent solubility in comparison to the raw ITZ. Furthermore, the stability of an amorphous glassy product and its potential to recrystallize in the presence of water have been experimentally determined using both excipients and interpreted applying molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Results show that recrystallization of the amorphous ITZ particles starts at their surface, corroborating that the better adsorption of GA into the surface of the particles inhibits the crystallization and provides long-term stability products. This study shows the importance of the selection of the excipient in the preparation of amorphous formulations of APIs, as well as their effect on the stability to recrystallize over storage or dosing in the presence of water.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Active pharmaceutical ingredients", "Glycyrrhizic acid", "In-vitro dissolution", "Long term stability", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Pharmaceutical ingredients", "Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA)", "Supercritical fluid extraction of emulsions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930684924", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"35772229100": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Ronco M.", "AuthorID": "35772229100", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Zurich, Institute of Process Engineering"}, "35741835600": {"Name": "Salvalaglio M.", "AuthorID": "35741835600", "AffiliationID": "60006824", "AffiliationName": "Facolt\u00e1 di Informatica, Istituto di Scienze Computazionali, Universit\u00e1 della Svizzera Italiana"}, "25653904800": {"Name": "Kluge J.", "AuthorID": "25653904800", "AffiliationID": "60020086", "AffiliationName": "EMPA, Laboratory for Advanced Fibers"}, "7005206227": {"Name": "Mazzotti M.", "AuthorID": "7005206227", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "ETH Zurich, Institute of Process Engineering"}}}
