Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground & Aims: Acute liver failure patients who meet poor prognostic criteria have high early mortality without emergency liver transplantation. A recent study however, reported that patients that survive spontaneously have a poorer outcome compared with patients undergoing transplantation. In this single centre study, we aimed to confirm or refute this observation. Methods: Early survivors (acute liver failure patients who survived 90 days after the ICU admission) were assessed for long-term outcomes in four distinctive cohorts, incorporating aetiology (Acetaminophen overdose or non-Acetaminophen overdose), and management strategy (conservative or liver transplantation). Chi Squared or Fisher test were used to compare outcomes among the four cohorts (P < 0.05) and Kaplan\u2013Meier curve (Log Rank test) to represent cumulative survival. Results: Two hundred consecutive acute liver failure patients between 1990 and 2014 were included; mean age 38.3, \u00b112.8, male 70, 35%. 124/200 (62%) early survivors were identified; 13/124 (10.5%) acetaminophen patients underwent transplantation and 48/124 (38.7%) survived spontaneously; 36/124 (29.0%) non-acetaminophen underwent transplantation and 27/124 (21.8%) survived spontaneously. A total of 11/124 (8.9%) died subsequently (median survival 5.3\u00b1 IQR 9.1), three spontaneous survivors and eight transplanted patients (P = 0.025); of the eight transplanted patients, six died of transplant related complications and two of suicide. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that although liver transplantation is a life-saving procedure for acute liver failure patients, they have a worse long-term outcome compared with spontaneous survivors. Novel therapies to increase the percentage of spontaneous survivors are urgently needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acetaminophen overdose", "early deaths", "early survivors", "emergency liver transplantation", "spontaneous survivors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetaminophen", "Adult", "Drug Overdose", "Female", "Humans", "Liver Failure, Acute", "Liver Transplantation", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Analysis", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052364912", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"57192870886": {"Name": "Putignano A.", "AuthorID": "57192870886", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care Unit, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57009088900": {"Name": "Figorilli F.", "AuthorID": "57009088900", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, UCL Medical School"}, "57203593178": {"Name": "Alabsawy E.", "AuthorID": "57203593178", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, UCL Medical School"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, UCL Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, UCL Medical School"}, "15749911500": {"Name": "Agarwal B.", "AuthorID": "15749911500", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care Unit, Royal Free Hospital, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
