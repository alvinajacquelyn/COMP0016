We have recently developed a series of approaches enabling high-resolution implementations, both using synchrotron radiation and laboratory-based set-ups. Three-dimensional reconstruction of absorption, phase and dark-field can be achieved with a simple rotation of the sample. All these approaches share a common trait which consists in the use of an absorber that shapes the radiation field, in order to make the phase modulations introduced by the sample detectable. This enables a well-defined and high-contrast structuring of the radiation field as well as an accurate modelling of the effects that are related to the simultaneous use of a wide range of energies. Moreover, it can also be adapted for use with detectors featuring large pixel sizes, which could be desirable when a high detection efficiency is important.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Detection efficiency", "Differential phase", "High resolution", "Laboratory solution", "Simple rotation", "Simultaneous use", "Three-dimensional reconstruction", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022006804", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55320675800": {"Name": "Vittoria F.A.", "AuthorID": "55320675800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35733519000": {"Name": "Diemoz P.C.", "AuthorID": "35733519000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56674572900": {"Name": "Kallon G.K.", "AuthorID": "56674572900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55362547500": {"Name": "Basta D.", "AuthorID": "55362547500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56954731500": {"Name": "Zamir A.", "AuthorID": "56954731500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55508570900": {"Name": "Hagen C.K.", "AuthorID": "55508570900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Harwell Oxford Campus"}, "36103067800": {"Name": "Wagner U.H.", "AuthorID": "36103067800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Oxford Campus"}, "57205077339": {"Name": "Rau C.", "AuthorID": "57205077339", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Oxford Campus"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.K.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}}}
