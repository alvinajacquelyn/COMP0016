The values are found to be \u03c3a=5.68\u00d7105 S/m (6.56\u00d7105 S/m) and \u03c3c=2.15\u00d7105 S/m (2.69\u00d7105 S/m) for Cr2TiAlC2 (Mo2TiAlC2) at 300 K. Using the phonon-mode Debye temperature and Slack-model, the lattice thermal conductivities in the two directions are also evaluated, and the values are \u03baa=18.71 W/m K (16.11 W/m K) and \u03bac=0.48 W/m K(0.25 W/m K) for Cr2TiAlC2 (Mo2TiAlC2) at room temperature. The anisotropy in lattice thermal conductivity is found to be stronger than that of electrical conductivity. The predicted Seebeck coefficients and thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) indicate that they are poor thermoelectric materials. Due to the relatively high conductivities, they might be used to fabricate high temperature conductive components in aerospace industry. In addition, our results in a direction have the direct implications for the relevant properties of MXenes (Cr2TiC2 and Mo2TiC2), produced from their bulk phases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cr2TiAlC2 and Mo2TiAlC2", "Electrical conductivity", "Thermal conductivity", "Thermoelectric property"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boltzmann transport theory", "Cr2TiAlC2 and Mo2TiAlC2", "Electrical conductivity", "First-principles study", "Lattice thermal conductivity", "Thermo-Electric materials", "Thermoelectric figure of merit", "Thermoelectric properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989204599", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"54385389700": {"Name": "Li Y.F.", "AuthorID": "54385389700", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Mechanical Behavior of Materials, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}, "56389883600": {"Name": "Ding Y.C.", "AuthorID": "56389883600", "AffiliationID": "60016318", "AffiliationName": "College of Optoelectronics Technology, Chengdu University of Information Technology"}, "55856717100": {"Name": "Xiao B.", "AuthorID": "55856717100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55549736400": {"Name": "Cheng Y.H.", "AuthorID": "55549736400", "AffiliationID": "60018308", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Electric Insulation and Power Equipment, Xi'an Jiaotong University"}}}
