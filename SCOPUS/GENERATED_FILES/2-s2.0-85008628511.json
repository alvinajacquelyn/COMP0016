Karger AG, Basel.Background: The p.R63W mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha (HNF4A) results in macrosomia and atypical Fanconi syndrome, in addition to hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (HI). We describe 2 infants carrying this mutation, presenting with additional features. Cases Series: Patient 1, a male born with a birth weight of 1.7 SDS, was diagnosed with HI on day 2 of life. He responded to 3-10 mg/kg/day of diazoxide. Raised serum creatinine led to the investigation of renal tubular function, showing leaking of electrolytes and protein. The patient also had conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia with liver steatosis. Patient 2 was a male born with a weight of 0.36 SDS. His mother had renal Fanconi syndrome. He received parenteral nutrition and presented with HI at 1 month of age, while establishing enteral feeds. Biochemistry workup showed renal tubular leaking of calcium, sodium, and phosphate. A hypoglycaemia screen documented HI, and the patient was commenced on 2 mg/kg/day of diazoxide. Continuous glucose monitoring was performed in his mother, revealing overnight hypoglycaemia. Conclusion: Renal Fanconi syndrome represents the only HNF4A feature showing complete penetrance. Our cases suggest that the p.R63W HNF4A mutation must be considered in subjects with a normal birth weight and postulate the possibility of liver involvement as a part of this condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 alpha", "Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia", "Macrosomic newborn", "Maturity-onset diabetes of the young", "Renal Fanconi syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Substitution", "Blood Glucose", "Congenital Hyperinsulinism", "Diazoxide", "Fanconi Syndrome", "Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Mutation, Missense"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008628511", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"37061141100": {"Name": "Improda N.", "AuthorID": "37061141100", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Traslational Sciences, Federico II University of Naples"}, "55936859700": {"Name": "Shah P.", "AuthorID": "55936859700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "56426933800": {"Name": "G\u00fcemes M.", "AuthorID": "56426933800", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "23988495800": {"Name": "Gilbert C.", "AuthorID": "23988495800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Paediatric Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "56623888600": {"Name": "Morgan K.", "AuthorID": "56623888600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Paediatric Endocrinology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "26643177200": {"Name": "Hussain K.", "AuthorID": "26643177200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, Clinical and Molecular Genetics Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6602980434": {"Name": "Bockenhauer D.", "AuthorID": "6602980434", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Nephrology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
