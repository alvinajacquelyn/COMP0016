Infection begins when aerosolized yeast or spores enter the body, triggering an immune response, including engulfment by macrophages. To understand the early transcriptional signals in both the yeast and its mammalian host, we performed a time-course dualtranscriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment for four lineages of C. gattii (lineages VGI to IV) interacting with mouse macrophages at 1, 3, and 6 h postinfection. Comparisons of in vitro to ex vivo gene expression levels indicated that lineage VGII is transcriptionally divergent from non-VGII lineages, including differential expression of genes involved in capsule synthesis, capsule attachment, and ergosterol production. Several paralogous genes demonstrated subfunctionalization between lineages, including upregulation of capsule biosynthesis-related gene CAP2 and downregulation of CAP1 in VGIII. Isolates also compensate for lineage-specific gene losses by overexpression of genetically similar paralogs, including overexpression of capsule gene CAS3 in VGIV, which have lost the CAS31 gene. Differential expression of one in five C. gattii genes was detected following coincubation with mouse macrophages; all isolates showed high induction of oxidative-reduction functions and downregulation of capsule attachment genes. We also found that VGII switches expression of two laccase paralogs (from LAC1 to LAC2) during coincubation of macrophages. Finally, we found that mouse macrophages respond to all four lineages of C. gattii by upregulating FosB/Jun/Egr1 regulatory proteins at early time points. This report highlights the evolutionary breadth of expression profiles among the lineages of C. gattii and the diversity of transcriptional responses at this host-pathogen interface.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Capsule", "Cryptococcus", "Ergosterol", "Host response", "Host-pathogen interactions", "Laccase", "MRNA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cryptococcosis", "Cryptococcus gattii", "Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal", "Genes, Mating Type, Fungal", "Mice", "Transcription, Genetic", "Virulence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055598937", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"25937288800": {"Name": "Farrer R.A.", "AuthorID": "25937288800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}, "56437255600": {"Name": "Rhodes J.", "AuthorID": "56437255600", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "55936464000": {"Name": "Fisher M.C.", "AuthorID": "55936464000", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "24767543600": {"Name": "Ford C.B.", "AuthorID": "24767543600", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program, The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "36815648100": {"Name": "Delorey T.", "AuthorID": "36815648100", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program, The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "56776223500": {"Name": "Cuomo C.A.", "AuthorID": "56776223500", "AffiliationID": "60001001, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Infectious Disease and Microbiome Program, The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard"}, "7202930914": {"Name": "May R.C.", "AuthorID": "7202930914", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Microbiology and Infection and School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "40661103700": {"Name": "Cloutman-Green E.", "AuthorID": "40661103700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Virology and Infection Prevention and Control, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701693410": {"Name": "Balloux F.", "AuthorID": "6701693410", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Virology and Infection Prevention and Control, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
