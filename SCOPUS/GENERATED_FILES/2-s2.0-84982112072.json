However, to ensure the success of the intervention, complete photo-coagulation of all anastomoses is needed. This is made difficult by the limited field of view of the fetoscopic video guidance, which hinders the surgeon's ability to locate all the anastomoses. A potential solution to this problem is to expand the field of view of the placental surface by creating a mosaic from overlapping fetoscopic images. This mosaic can then be used for anastomoses localization and spatial orientation during surgery. However, this requires accurate and fast algorithms that can operate within the real-time constraints of fetal surgery. In this work, we present an image mosaicing framework that leverages the parallelism of modern GPUs and can process clinical fetoscopic images in real-time. Initial qualitative results on ex-vivo placental images indicate that the proposed framework can generate clinically useful mosaics from fetoscopic videos in real-time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CUDA", "feature extraction", "GPU", "Image stitching", "image-guided surgery", "Mosaicing", "SIFT"], "IndexKeywords": ["CUDA", "Image guided surgery", "Image stitching", "Mosaicing", "SIFT"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982112072", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56674274500": {"Name": "Daga P.", "AuthorID": "56674274500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "55367064500": {"Name": "Chadebecq F.", "AuthorID": "55367064500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Robot Vision Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "38562092100": {"Name": "Shakir D.I.", "AuthorID": "38562092100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "57217789246": {"Name": "Herrera L.C.G.", "AuthorID": "57217789246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "57190659407": {"Name": "Tella M.", "AuthorID": "57190659407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "56742945400": {"Name": "Dwyer G.", "AuthorID": "56742945400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Robot Vision Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "23010613000": {"Name": "Vercauteren T.", "AuthorID": "23010613000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical Robot Vision Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "7402605276": {"Name": "David A.L.", "AuthorID": "7402605276", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55981137300": {"Name": "Deprest J.", "AuthorID": "55981137300", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Leuven, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology"}}}
