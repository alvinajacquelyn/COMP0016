Methods: We compared direct medical costs and indirect productivity costs associated with treatment with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) in the ROSE (Radiosurgery or Open Surgery for Epilepsy) trial. Health care use was abstracted from hospital bills, the study database, and diaries in which participants recorded health care use and time lost from work while seeking care. Costs of use were calculated using a Medicare costing approach used in a prior study of the costs of ATL. The power of many analyses was limited by the sample size and data skewing. Results: Combined treatment and follow-up costs (in thousands of US dollars) did not differ between SRS (n = 20, mean = $76.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 50.7-115.6) and ATL (n = 18, mean = $79.0, 95% CI = 60.09-103.8). Indirect costs also did not differ. More ATL than SRS participants were free of consciousness-impairing seizures in each year of follow-up (all P < 0.05). Costs declined following ATL (P = 0.005). Costs tended to increase over the first 18 months following SRS (P = 0.17) and declined thereafter (P = 0.06). This mostly reflected hospitalizations for SRS-related adverse events in the second year of follow-up. Significance: Lower initial costs of SRS for medial temporal lobe epilepsy were largely offset by hospitalization costs related to adverse events later in the course of follow-up. Future studies of less-invasive alternatives to ATL will need to assess adverse events and major costs systematically and prospectively to understand the economic implications of adopting these technologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["costs", "epilepsy", "health care", "lobectomy", "radiosurgery"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067673861", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57203023694": {"Name": "Langfitt J.T.", "AuthorID": "57203023694", "AffiliationID": "60027165", "AffiliationName": "University of Rochester"}, "7102799047": {"Name": "Quigg M.", "AuthorID": "7102799047", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "7202089770": {"Name": "Yan G.", "AuthorID": "7202089770", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "57201397171": {"Name": "Yu W.", "AuthorID": "57201397171", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "6602887353": {"Name": "Broshek D.K.", "AuthorID": "6602887353", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "6701542884": {"Name": "Fountain N.B.", "AuthorID": "6701542884", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "7403168526": {"Name": "Ward M.M.", "AuthorID": "7403168526", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "7401837635": {"Name": "Chang E.F.", "AuthorID": "7401837635", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "35408019300": {"Name": "Sneed P.K.", "AuthorID": "35408019300", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "35315887900": {"Name": "Hess C.", "AuthorID": "35315887900", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "7201693984": {"Name": "Garcia P.A.", "AuthorID": "7201693984", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "7005637791": {"Name": "Knowlton R.C.", "AuthorID": "7005637791", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Francisco"}, "7006590565": {"Name": "Barbaro N.M.", "AuthorID": "7006590565", "AffiliationID": "60024609", "AffiliationName": "Indiana University"}, "7004621346": {"Name": "Salanova V.", "AuthorID": "7004621346", "AffiliationID": "60024609", "AffiliationName": "Indiana University"}, "7006563876": {"Name": "Laxer K.D.", "AuthorID": "7006563876", "AffiliationID": "60021137", "AffiliationName": "California Pacific Medical Center"}, "56691154000": {"Name": "Cole A.J.", "AuthorID": "56691154000", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "7007046120": {"Name": "Tripathi M.", "AuthorID": "7007046120", "AffiliationID": "60009790", "AffiliationName": "All India Institute of Medical Science"}, "7003880650": {"Name": "Heck C.N.", "AuthorID": "7003880650", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "University of Southern California"}, "57208920424": {"Name": "Miller J.W.", "AuthorID": "57208920424", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "University of Washington"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "8680546600": {"Name": "Bagi\u0107 A.", "AuthorID": "8680546600", "AffiliationID": "60015543", "AffiliationName": "University of Pittsburgh"}, "35434346000": {"Name": "Henry T.", "AuthorID": "35434346000", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota"}, "57023046200": {"Name": "Kapoor S.", "AuthorID": "57023046200", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "University of Kentucky"}, "7006642858": {"Name": "McKhann G.", "AuthorID": "7006642858", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University"}, "16067370500": {"Name": "Palade A.E.", "AuthorID": "16067370500", "AffiliationID": "60020633", "AffiliationName": "University of Louisville"}, "7102183040": {"Name": "Reuber M.", "AuthorID": "7102183040", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "6603042914": {"Name": "Tecoma E.", "AuthorID": "6603042914", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "University of California, San Diego"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
