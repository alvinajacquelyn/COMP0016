However, there is limited research looking at outcomes of treatment in a qualitative manner from the patients' perspective. It is crucial to have a better understanding of these outcomes to allow management of expectations and enhance satisfaction with treatment. Objectives: To assess the outcomes of orthodontic treatment from the adolescent patient perspective. Subjects and methods: This was a prospective qualitative study in which 20 adolescent patients (aged 13-18 years), and parents, were interviewed using semi-structured in-depth interviews to assess how they felt about the outcomes of their treatment. The interviews were digitally recorded and then transcribed verbatim, and a content thematic analysis was undertaken using a framework approach. This publication reports on data from the patient interviews. Results: Thematic analysis identified three main themes and associated subthemes. The themes were as follows: (1) health-related behavioural changes, including improvement in the perceived ability to maintain good oral hygiene and better diet; (2) dental health, encompassing enhanced aesthetics, function, and reduction in plaque accumulation; and (3) psychosocial influences, for example enhanced confidence, self-esteem, and better social interactions. These themes support the quality of life benefits of treatment. Conclusion and Implications: Interviewing adolescent patients identified the important positive, and potentially long-term, benefits of orthodontic treatment. The results provide invaluable information, which increases our understanding of the treatment we provide and gives important information that can be used when managing expectations during the informed consent stage. It is hoped that this may allow enhanced satisfaction following treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Esthetics, Dental", "Humans", "Orthodontics, Corrective", "Prospective Studies", "Qualitative Research", "Quality of Life", "Self Concept"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066959761", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthodontics", "DENT", "3505"]], "AuthorData": {"57209236692": {"Name": "Alquraini N.", "AuthorID": "57209236692", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36009283900": {"Name": "Shah R.", "AuthorID": "36009283900", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201937126": {"Name": "Cunningham S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201937126", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, Eastman Dental Hospital, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
