Design Cross-sectional study where anthropometric, biochemical and clinical measurements were taken in addition to interview-based completion of an extensive questionnaire on health and lifestyle parameters. Dietary patterns were derived through principal component analysis based on a validated FFQ. Setting Geographically isolated Mylopotamos villages on Mount Idi, Crete, Greece. Subjects Adults (n 1553). Results Mean age of the participants was 61\u00b76 years and 55\u00b78 % were women. Of the population, 82\u00b77 % were overweight or obese with a significantly different prevalence between overweight men and women (43\u00b74 v. 34\u00b77 %, P=0\u00b7002). The majority (70\u00b76 %) of participants were married, while a larger proportion of women were widowed than men (27\u00b78 v. 3\u00b75 %, P<0\u00b7001). Smoking was more prevalent in men (38\u00b77 v. 8\u00b72 %, P<0\u00b7001), as 88\u00b78% of women had never smoked. Four dietary patterns emerged as characteristic of the population; these were termed 'local', 'high fat and sugar, 'Greek caf\u00e9/tavern' and 'olive oil, fruits and vegetables'. Individuals more adherent to the local dietary pattern presented higher blood glucose (\u03b2=4\u00b7026, P<0\u00b7001). Similarly, individuals with higher compliance with the Greek caf\u00e9/tavern pattern had higher waist-to-hip ratio (\u03b2=0\u00b7012, P<0\u00b7001), blood pressure (\u03b2=1\u00b7015, P=0\u00b7005) and cholesterol (\u03b2=5\u00b7398, P<0\u00b7001).
