Its basic form is derived from semi-classical magnetoresistance theory with fitting parameters allowing adjustment to particular samples. Thermal conductivity measurements at 5.5 K and in fields from 0 to 2 T are presented on two single crystals of tungsten with significantly different purities. We find that\u2014with suitable adjustment of the fitting parameters\u2014the equation is an excellent fit to the data in both cases. The significance of the fitting parameters and differences in their values are discussed, and we describe how they can be related to the individual properties of the samples. It is concluded that the equation should be applicable to any field below that at which orbit quantisation occurs and temperatures from 6 K down to tungsten\u2019s superconducting transition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetoresistance", "ADRs", "Magnetoconductivity", "Thermal conductivity", "Tungsten"], "IndexKeywords": ["ADRs", "Fitting parameters", "High-field", "Magneto-conductivity", "Quantisation", "Superconducting transitions", "Thermal conductivity measurements", "Zero fields"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919763930", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"36189582500": {"Name": "Hills M.J.", "AuthorID": "36189582500", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "6602798730": {"Name": "Hepburn I.D.", "AuthorID": "6602798730", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "35745660900": {"Name": "Bartlett J.", "AuthorID": "35745660900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "57198234841": {"Name": "Hardy G.", "AuthorID": "57198234841", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
