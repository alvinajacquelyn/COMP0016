The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.Halos and galaxies acquire their angular momentum during the collapse of the surrounding large-scale structure. This process imprints alignments between galaxy spins and nearby filaments and sheets. Low-mass halos grow by accretion onto filaments, aligning their spins with the filaments, whereas high-mass halos grow by mergers along filaments, generating spins perpendicular to the filament. We search for this alignment signal using filaments identified with the \"Cosmic Web Reconstruction\" algorithm applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Main Galaxy Sample and galaxy spins from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) integral-field unit survey. MaNGA produces a map of the galaxy's rotational velocity, allowing direct measurement of the galaxy's spin direction, or unit angular momentum vector projected onto the sky. We find no evidence for alignment between galaxy spins and filament directions. We do find hints of a mass-dependent alignment signal, which is in 2\u03c3-3\u03c3 tension with the mass-dependent alignment signal in the MassiveBlack-II and Illustris hydrodynamical simulations. However, the tension vanishes when galaxy spin is measured using the H\u03b1 emission line velocity rather than stellar velocity. Finally, in simulations we find that the mass-dependent transition from aligned to anti-aligned dark matter halo spins is not necessarily present in stellar spins: we find a stellar spin transition in Illustris but not in MassiveBlack-II, highlighting the sensitivity of spin-filament alignments to feedback prescriptions and subgrid physics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmology: observations", "galaxies: evolution", "galaxies: formation", "large-scale structure of universe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067292984", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56592165000": {"Name": "Krolewski A.", "AuthorID": "56592165000", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Lawrence Berkeley National Lab"}, "36615345000": {"Name": "Ho S.", "AuthorID": "36615345000", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, University of California at Berkeley, New Campbell Hall"}, "57209304926": {"Name": "Chan P.F.", "AuthorID": "57209304926", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "56152658800": {"Name": "Tenneti A.", "AuthorID": "56152658800", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "55787626900": {"Name": "Chen Y.C.", "AuthorID": "55787626900", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistics, University of Washington"}, "6604066979": {"Name": "Bizyaev D.", "AuthorID": "6604066979", "AffiliationID": "60007457", "AffiliationName": "Sternberg Astronomical Institute, Moscow State University"}, "55355997900": {"Name": "Kraljic K.", "AuthorID": "55355997900", "AffiliationID": "60110880, 60006858, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory, Blackford Hill"}}}
