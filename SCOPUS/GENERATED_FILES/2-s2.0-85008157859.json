This specific goal is accomplished by more generally extending the recent D\u00e9j\u00e0 Q framework (Chase and Meiklejohn, Eurocrypt 2014) in two main directions. First, by teasing out common properties of existing reductions, we expand the q-type assumptions that can be covered by the framework; i.e., we demonstrate broader classes of assumptions that can be reduced to subgroup hiding. Second, while the original framework applied only to asymmetric composite-order bilinear groups, we provide a reduction to subgroup hiding that works in symmetric (as well as asymmetric) composite-order groups. As a bonus, our new reduction achieves a tightness of log(q) rather than q.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attribute-based", "Bilinear groups", "Common property", "Composite-order groups", "Dynamic-Q", "Hierarchical identity-based encryptions"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008157859", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36890579100": {"Name": "Chase M.", "AuthorID": "36890579100", "AffiliationID": "60021726", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research Redmond"}, "57192807974": {"Name": "Maller M.", "AuthorID": "57192807974", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36717929200": {"Name": "Meiklejohn S.", "AuthorID": "36717929200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
