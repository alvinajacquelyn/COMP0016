To date, most of the evidence stems from either single-meal studies or highly heterogeneous cohort studies. We aimed to study the prospective associations of diet GI at age 53 years with outcomes of verbal memory and letter search tests at age 69 years and rate of decline between 53 and 69 years. Design: Longitudinal population-based birth cohort study. Setting: MRC National Survey for Health and Development. Participants: Cohort members (n 1252). Results: Using multivariable linear and logistic regression, adjusted for potential confounders, associations of higher-GI diet with lower verbal memory, lower letter search speed and lower number of hits in a letter search test were attenuated after adjustments for cognitive ability at age 15 years, educational attainment, further training and occupational social class. No association was observed between diet GI at 53 years and letter search accuracy or speed-accuracy trade-off at 69 years, or between diet GI at 53 years and rate of decline between 53 and 69 years in any cognitive measure. Conclusions: Diet GI does not appear to predict cognitive function or decline, which was mainly explained by childhood cognitive ability, education and occupational social class. Our findings confirm the need for further research on the association between diet and cognition from a life-course perspective.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aged", "Carbohydrates", "Glucose release", "National Survey of Health and Development", "Prospective study"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065085749", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"13613837300": {"Name": "Philippou E.", "AuthorID": "13613837300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences Division, King's College London"}, "13806095100": {"Name": "Pot G.K.", "AuthorID": "13806095100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences Division, King's College London"}, "24066844700": {"Name": "Heraclides A.", "AuthorID": "24066844700", "AffiliationID": "60104028, 60172338", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, Medical School, University of Nicosia"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, University College London"}, "55074751900": {"Name": "Bendayan R.", "AuthorID": "55074751900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department Biostatistics and Health Informatics, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London"}}}
