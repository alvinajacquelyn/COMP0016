Data were drawn from French occupational cohort (the GAZEL study, 1989\u20132010). This nested case\u2013control study included 915 deceased men and women and 2578 controls matched for sex, baseline age, occupational grade and marital status. Self-rated health was measured annually and dichotomized into good versus poor health. Trajectories of poor self-rated health up to 15 years were compared among people who subsequently died to those who survived. Participants contributed to an average 10.3 repeated assessments of self-rated health. Repeated-measures log-binomial regression analysis with generalized estimating equations showed an increased prevalence of poor self-rated health in cases 13\u201315 years prior to death from ischemic and other cardiovascular disease [multivariable-adjusted risk ratio 2.06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.55\u20132.75], non-smoking-related cancers (1.57, 95 % CI 1.30\u20131.89), and suicide (1.78, 95 % CI 1.00\u20133.16). Prior to death from ischemic and other cardiovascular disease, increased rates of poor self-rated health were evident even among persons who were free of cardiovascular diseases (2.05, 95 % CI 1.50\u20132.78). In conclusion, perceptions of health diverged between the surviving controls and the deceased already 15 years prior to death. For cardiovascular mortality, decline in self-rated health started before diagnosis of the disease leading to death. The findings suggest that declining self-rated health might capture pathological changes before and beyond the disease diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cause-specific mortality", "Cohort study", "Self-rated health", "Trajectory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Case-Control Studies", "Cause of Death", "Female", "France", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Neoplasms", "Prevalence", "Regression Analysis", "Risk Factors", "Suicide"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937701874", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"16308130100": {"Name": "Stenholm S.", "AuthorID": "16308130100", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences and the Gerontology Research Center (GEREC), University of Tampere"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765", "AffiliationName": "Turku University Hospital"}, "7003317196": {"Name": "Jylh\u00e4 M.", "AuthorID": "7003317196", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences and the Gerontology Research Center (GEREC), University of Tampere"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "7003843149": {"Name": "Pentti J.", "AuthorID": "7003843149", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7103096477": {"Name": "Kawachi I.", "AuthorID": "7103096477", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Society, Human Development, and Health, Harvard School of Public Health"}, "57203071324": {"Name": "Westerlund H.", "AuthorID": "57203071324", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "University of Stockholm"}, "7404395870": {"Name": "Goldberg M.", "AuthorID": "7404395870", "AffiliationID": "60014856, 60106188, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, UMS 011, H\u00f4pital Paul Brousse"}, "7005528594": {"Name": "Zins M.", "AuthorID": "7005528594", "AffiliationID": "60014856, 60106188, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM, UMS 011, H\u00f4pital Paul Brousse"}}}
