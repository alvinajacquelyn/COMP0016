Estimates of the thermal conductivity of the most abundant phase, MgSiO<inf>3</inf> perovskite, at core-mantle boundary conditions vary by a factor of ten. We performed ab initio simulations to determine the lattice thermal conductivity of MgSiO<inf>3</inf> perovskite, finding a value of 6.8\u00b10.9 Wm<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup> at core-mantle boundary conditions (136 GPa and 4000 K), consistent with geophysical constraints for the thermal state at the base of the mantle. Thermal conductivity depends strongly on pressure, explaining the dynamical stability of super-plumes. The dependence on temperature and composition is weak in the deep mantle: our results exhibit saturation as the phonon mean free path approaches the interatomic spacing. Combining our results with seismic tomography, we find large lateral variations in the heat-flux from the core that have important implications for core dynamics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mantle dynamics", "MgSiO<inf>3</inf> perovskite", "Thermal conductivity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio simulations", "Core-mantle boundary", "Dynamical stability", "First-principles calculation", "Lattice thermal conductivity", "Mantle dynamics", "Phonon mean free path", "Temperature variation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936980614", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"6603707168": {"Name": "Stackhouse S.", "AuthorID": "6603707168", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}, "7003403662": {"Name": "Stixrude L.", "AuthorID": "7003403662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7004760772": {"Name": "Karki B.", "AuthorID": "7004760772", "AffiliationID": "60007566", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Department of Geology and Geophysics and Center for Computation and Technology, Louisiana State University"}}}
