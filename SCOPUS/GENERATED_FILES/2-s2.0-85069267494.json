Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Introduction: The lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) population experience health and social inequalities, including discrimination within healthcare services. There is a growing international awareness of the importance of providing healthcare professionals and students with dedicated training on LGBT+ health. Methods: We introduced a compulsory teaching programme in a large London-based medical school, including a visit from a transgender patient. Feedback was collected across four years, before (n = 433) and after (n = 541) the session. Student confidence in using appropriate terminology and performing a clinical assessment on LGBT+ people was assessed with five-point Likert scales. Fisher exact tests were used to compare the proportion responding \u201cagree\u201d or \u201cstrongly agree\u201d. Results: Of the students, 95% (CI 93\u201397%) found the teaching useful with 97% (96\u201399%) finding the visitor\u2019s input helpful. Confidence using appropriate terminology to describe sexual orientation increased from 62% (58\u201367%) to 93% (91\u201395%) (Fisher p < 0.001) and gender identity from 41% (36\u201346%) to 91% (88\u201393%) (p < 0.001). Confidence in the clinical assessment of a lesbian, gay or bisexual patient increased from 75% (71\u201379%) to 93% (90\u2013 95%) (p < 0.001), and of a transgender patient from 35% (31\u201340%) to 84% (80\u201387%) (p < 0.001). Discussion: This teaching programme, written and delivered in collaboration with the LGBT+ community, increases students\u2019 confidence in using appropriate language related to sexual orientation and gender identity, and in the clinical assessment of LGBT+ patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Curriculum development", "Decolonizing the curriculum", "Gay", "Lesbian", "LGBT", "Medical education", "Transgender", "Undergraduate medical education"], "IndexKeywords": ["Curriculum", "Female", "Gender Identity", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Sexual and Gender Minorities", "Students, Medical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069267494", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57205648239": {"Name": "Salkind J.", "AuthorID": "57205648239", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department, University College London Medical School"}, "6505741121": {"Name": "Gishen F.", "AuthorID": "6505741121", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57213299521": {"Name": "Kavanagh J.", "AuthorID": "57213299521", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205645924": {"Name": "Drage G.", "AuthorID": "57205645924", "AffiliationID": "121718708", "AffiliationName": "Groundwork London"}, "12783188400": {"Name": "Potts H.W.W.", "AuthorID": "12783188400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Health Informatics"}}}
