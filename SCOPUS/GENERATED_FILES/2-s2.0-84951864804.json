Due to the expensive cost of mutation testing, selective mutation testing was first proposed in 1991 by Mathur, in which a subset of mutants are selected aiming to achieve the same effectiveness as the whole set of mutants in evaluating the quality of test suites. Though selective mutation testing has been widely investigated in recent years, many people still doubt if it can suit well for large programs. Realizing that none of the existing work has systematically studied the scalability of selective mutation testing, I plan to work on the scalability of selective mutation testing through several studies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Large programs", "Mutation testing", "Selective mutation", "Test method"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951864804", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"36505536200": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "36505536200", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60025256", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Software, School of EECS, Peking University"}}}
