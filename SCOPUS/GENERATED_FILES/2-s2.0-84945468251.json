Improved understanding of the determinants will inform effective interventions to reduce SSB consumption. A total of 46,876 papers were identified through searching eight electronic databases. Evidence from intervention (n=13), prospective (n=6) and cross-sectional (n=25) studies on correlates/determinants of SSB consumption was quality assessed and synthesized. Twelve correlates/determinants were associated with higher SSB consumption (child's preference for SSBs, TV viewing/screen time and snack consumption; parents' lower socioeconomic status, lower age, SSB consumption, formula milk feeding, early introduction of solids, using food as rewards, parental-perceived barriers, attending out-of-home care and living near a fast food/convenience store). Five correlates/determinants were associated with lower SSB consumption (parental positive modelling, parents' married/co-habiting, school nutrition policy, staff skills and supermarket nearby). There was equivocal evidence for child's age and knowledge, parental knowledge, skills, rules/restrictions and home SSB availability. Eight intervention studies targeted multi-level (child, parents, childcare/preschool setting) determinants; four were effective. Four intervention studies targeted parental determinants; two were effective. One (effective) intervention targeted the preschool environment. There is consistent evidence to support potentially modifiable correlates/determinants of SSB consumption in young children acting at parental (modelling), child (TV viewing) and environmental (school policy) levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Correlates", "Determinants", "Sugar-sweetened beverage", "Systematic review", "Young children"], "IndexKeywords": ["Australia", "Beverages", "Child", "Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dietary Sucrose", "Europe", "Humans", "Nutrition Policy", "Nutritive Value", "Parents", "Pediatric Obesity", "Prospective Studies", "Schools", "Sweetening Agents", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945468251", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55904344600": {"Name": "Mazarello Paes V.", "AuthorID": "55904344600", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "7201880869": {"Name": "Griffin S.", "AuthorID": "7201880869", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, UKCRC Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), University of Cambridge"}, "35233749600": {"Name": "Lakshman R.", "AuthorID": "35233749600", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, UKCRC Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), University of Cambridge"}, "55868344300": {"Name": "Hesketh K.", "AuthorID": "55868344300", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, UKCRC Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), University of Cambridge"}, "8570650800": {"Name": "van Sluijs E.M.F.", "AuthorID": "8570650800", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, UKCRC Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), University of Cambridge"}, "7102309097": {"Name": "Ong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7102309097", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "MRC Epidemiology Unit, UKCRC Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), University of Cambridge"}, "36948721400": {"Name": "O'Malley C.", "AuthorID": "36948721400", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health, Durham University Queens Campus"}, "7202287002": {"Name": "Moore H.", "AuthorID": "7202287002", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health, Durham University Queens Campus"}, "7004194799": {"Name": "Summerbell C.", "AuthorID": "7004194799", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health, Durham University Queens Campus"}}}
