Consequently, synaptic biomarkers may be valuable tools for both early diagnosis and disease stage. Neurogranin (Ng) is a postsynaptic protein involved in memory consolidation. Methods We developed three monoclonal anti-Ng antibodies. Mass spectrometry and a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Ng in three independent clinical cohorts including patients with AD dementia (n = 100 in total), mild cognitive impairment patients (MCI), (n = 40) and controls (n = 80 in total). Results We show in three independent clinical cohorts a marked increase in CSF Ng levels in AD dementia (P < .001 in all studies). In addition, high CSF Ng levels at the MCI stage predicted progression to dementia due to AD with a hazard ratio of 12.8 (95% confidence interval 1.6-103.0, P = .02). In amyloid-positive MCI patients, high CSF Ng correlated with a more rapid change in cognition during clinical follow-up (P = .03). Discussion These results suggest that CSF Ng is a novel AD biomarker that may be used to monitor synaptic degeneration, and correlates with the rate of cognitive decline in prodromal AD.",
