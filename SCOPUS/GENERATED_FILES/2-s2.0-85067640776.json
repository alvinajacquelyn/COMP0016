In Drosophila, the activation of Arp2/3 by WASp is specifically required for Notch signaling following asymmetric cell division. How WASp and Arp2/3 regulate Notch activity and why receptor activation requires WASp and Arp2/3 only in the context of intra-lineage fate decisions are unclear. Here, we find that WASp, but not SCAR, is required for Notch activation soon after division of the sensory organ precursor cell. Conversely, SCAR, but not WASp, is required to expand the cell-cell contact between the two SOP daughters. Thus, these two activities of Arp2/3 can be uncoupled. Using a time-resolved endocytosis assay, we show that WASp and Arp2/3 are required for the endocytosis of Dl only during cytokinesis. We propose that WASp-Arp2/3 provides an extra pushing force that is specifically required for the efficient endocytosis of Dl during cytokinesis. WASp-Arp2/3 is required for Notch-mediated intra-lineage fate decisions. Trylinski and Schweisguth report that WASp-Arp2/3 is key for the efficient endocytosis of Delta only during cytokinesis. This helps explain how and why how actin polymerization is key for Notch activation only in the context of asymmetric cell divisions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["actin", "Arp2/3", "asymmetric cell division", "cell fate", "cytokinesis", "Drosophila", "endocytosis", "neurogenesis", "Notch", "WASp"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actin-Related Protein 2", "Actins", "Animals", "Cytokinesis", "Drosophila", "Drosophila Proteins", "Endocytosis", "Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins", "Membrane Proteins", "Microfilament Proteins", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt", "Receptors, Notch", "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067640776", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56449426200": {"Name": "Trylinski M.", "AuthorID": "56449426200", "AffiliationID": "60001422", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9, Coll\u00e8ge Doctoral"}, "7004739017": {"Name": "Schweisguth F.", "AuthorID": "7004739017", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60001772", "AffiliationName": "Institut Pasteur, UMR3738, CNRS"}}}
