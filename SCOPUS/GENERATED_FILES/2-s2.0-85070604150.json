This study provides a comprehensive review and analysis of the state-of-the-art latest research and industry standards development that impact upon BIM and asset management within the operations and maintenance (O&M) phase. However, BIM is not always enough in whole-life cycle asset management, especially in the O&M phase. Therefore, a framework for future development of smart asset management is proposed, integrating the concept of Digital Twin (DT). DT integrates artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics to create dynamic digital models that are able to learn and update the status of the physical counterpart from multiple sources. The findings will contribute to inspiring novel research ideas and promote widespread adoption of smart DT-enabled asset management within the O&M phase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asset management", "Building Information Model (BIM)", "Digital Twins (DT)", "Operations and maintenance (O&M)"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070604150", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"56717065200": {"Name": "Lu Q.", "AuthorID": "56717065200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Manufacturing (IfM), University of Cambridge"}, "57210411313": {"Name": "Xie X.", "AuthorID": "57210411313", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Manufacturing (IfM), University of Cambridge"}, "57205622310": {"Name": "Heaton J.", "AuthorID": "57205622310", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Manufacturing (IfM), University of Cambridge"}, "9736080300": {"Name": "Parlikad A.", "AuthorID": "9736080300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Manufacturing (IfM), University of Cambridge"}, "57189900369": {"Name": "Schooling J.", "AuthorID": "57189900369", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CSIC), University Of Cambridge"}}}
