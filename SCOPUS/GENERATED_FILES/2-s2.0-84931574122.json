Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Aim To explore the influence of inter-dental tissues and root surface condition on complete root coverage following surgical treatment of gingival recessions. Methods Three hundred and eighty-six single recessions treated over 28 years were assessed. Patient-level and periodontal variables, presence/loss of inter-dental tissues, and presence/absence of non-carious cervical lesions (NCCLs) were recorded. Root coverage was assessed 1-year post-surgery. Multilevel analysis was performed to identify predictors of CRC. Results Based on type of root coverage procedure four patient groups were created: free gingival graft (FGG) (n = 116), coronally advanced flap (CAF) (n = 107), CAF+connective tissue graft (CTG) (n = 131), and guided tissue regeneration (GTR) (n = 32). Percentages of complete root coverage (CRC) were 18.1% for FGG, 35.5% for CAF, 35.1% for CAF+CTG, and 18.8% for GTR. There was an OR = 0.26 (p < 0.0001) of achieving CRC in cases with loss of inter-dental tissue compared with cases with no inter-dental tissue loss. Similarly, cases with presence of NCCL showed an OR = 0.28 (p < 0.0001) of achieving CRC compared with cases without a NCCL. FGG achieved less CRC then CAF+CTG (p = 0.0012; OR = 0.32). Conclusions NCCLs, just like inter-dental tissue loss, are significant negative prognostic factors in achieving CRC following root coverage procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cemento-enamel junction", "gingival recession", "mucogingival surgery", "periodontal attachment loss", "tooth/dental abrasion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Alveolar Bone Loss", "Alveolar Process", "Child", "Connective Tissue", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Free Tissue Flaps", "Gingiva", "Gingival Recession", "Guided Tissue Regeneration, Periodontal", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Periodontal Attachment Loss", "Periodontal Pocket", "Retrospective Studies", "Smoking", "Surgical Flaps", "Tooth Abrasion", "Tooth Erosion", "Tooth Root", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931574122", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"55666438700": {"Name": "Pini-Prato G.", "AuthorID": "55666438700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7005391103": {"Name": "Magnani C.", "AuthorID": "7005391103", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Translational Medicine, University of Florence"}, "7003711963": {"Name": "Rotundo R.", "AuthorID": "7003711963", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Periodontal Unit, Eastman Dental Institute, University College of London"}, "55935716500": {"Name": "Zaheer F.", "AuthorID": "55935716500", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "School of Dentistry University of Manchester"}, "15842800000": {"Name": "Buti J.", "AuthorID": "15842800000", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "School of Dentistry University of Manchester"}}}
