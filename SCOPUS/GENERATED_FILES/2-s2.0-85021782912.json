Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. All rights reserved.Background: Electronic prescribing (EP) and electronic hospital pharmacy (EHP) systems are increasingly common. A potential benefit is the extensive data in these systems that could be used to support antimicrobial stewardship, but there is little information on how such data are currently used to support the quality and safety of antimicrobial use. Objectives: To summarize the literature on secondary use of data (SuD) from EP and EHP systems to support quality and safety of antimicrobial use, to describe any barriers to secondary use and to make recommendations for future work in this field. Methods: We conducted a systematic search within four databases; we included original research studies that were (1) based on SuD from hospital EP or EHP systems and (2) reported outcomes relating to quality and/or safety of antimicrobial use and/or qualitative findings relating to SuD in this context. Results: Ninety-four full-text articles were obtained; 14 met our inclusion criteria. Only two described interventions based on SuD; seven described SuD to evaluate other antimicrobial stewardship interventions and five described descriptive or exploratory studies of potential applications of SuD. Types of data used were quantitative antibiotic usage data (n=9 studies), dose administration data (n=4) and user log data from an electronic dashboard (n=1). Barriers included data access, data accuracy and completeness, and complexity when using data from multiple systems or hospital sites. Conclusions: The literature suggests that SuD fromEP and EHP systems is potentially useful to support or evaluate antimicrobial stewardship activities; greater system functionality would help to realize these benefits.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Anti-Infective Agents", "Antimicrobial Stewardship", "Data Collection", "Electronic Prescribing", "Hospitals", "Humans", "Pharmacy", "Pharmacy Service, Hospital"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021782912", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56030684900": {"Name": "Micallef C.", "AuthorID": "56030684900", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, Addenbrook\u00e8s Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401687091": {"Name": "Holmes A.H.", "AuthorID": "7401687091", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7202260726": {"Name": "Hopkins S.", "AuthorID": "7202260726", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "16416542300": {"Name": "Franklin B.D.", "AuthorID": "16416542300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57194720977": {"Name": "Chaudhry N.T.", "AuthorID": "57194720977", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60184415", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Imperial Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Imperial College London"}, "57207537046": {"Name": "Benn J.", "AuthorID": "57207537046", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60184415", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Imperial Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Imperial College London"}}}
