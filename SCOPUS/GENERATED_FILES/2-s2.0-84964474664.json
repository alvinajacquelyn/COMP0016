Yet to what extend mental training shapes brain function and structure is not well understood. The present investigation explored functional and structural changes using a multimodal framework after four weeks of MI neurofeedback training. Efficient MI training was archived by using a low-density mobile EEG system at the participants' home. Following training functional changes as increased classification accuracies, stronger contra lateral EEG and BOLD activity were observed. Functional plasticity was accompanied by structural changes in gray matter. Together, this proof-of concept investigation provides preliminary evidence that MI training induces systematic changes in brain function and structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain-computer interface (BCI)", "Fractional anisotropy", "Neurofeedback", "Voxel-based morphometry (VBM)", "Wireless EEG"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classification accuracy", "Electro-encephalogram (EEG)", "Fractional Anisotropy", "Functional changes", "Multimodal frameworks", "Neurofeedback", "Systematic changes", "Voxel-based morphometry"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964474664", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"55916575100": {"Name": "Zich C.", "AuthorID": "55916575100", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Neuropsychology Lab European Medical School, University of Oldenburg"}, "57188975295": {"Name": "Schweinitz C.", "AuthorID": "57188975295", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Neuropsychology Lab European Medical School, University of Oldenburg"}, "6601953065": {"Name": "Debener S.", "AuthorID": "6601953065", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Neuropsychology Lab European Medical School, University of Oldenburg"}, "15077752900": {"Name": "Kranczioch C.", "AuthorID": "15077752900", "AffiliationID": "60020306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Neuropsychology Lab European Medical School, University of Oldenburg"}}}
