On the other hand, wireless mesh networks, a network topology that has been discuss for decades that haven't been put into use in large scale, can make a difference when it comes to the network in the IoT world today. This paper is a brief introduction of how these technologies has the possibility to come together and how to integrate the mesh network into existing IoT networks to potentially make a difference in the new era.", "AuthorKeywords": ["IoT", "network topology", "sensors", "wireless", "Wireless Mesh Networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communication engineering", "IOT networks", "Network topology"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027146097", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"]], "AuthorData": {"57206823810": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206823810", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.F.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57195324869": {"Name": "Qiu X.", "AuthorID": "57195324869", "AffiliationID": "116393977", "AffiliationName": "Chengdu Engineering Corporation Limited, Power China"}, "57195326442": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57195326442", "AffiliationID": "116393977", "AffiliationName": "Chengdu Engineering Corporation Limited, Power China"}, "23097128600": {"Name": "Ding X.", "AuthorID": "23097128600", "AffiliationID": "116393977", "AffiliationName": "Chengdu Engineering Corporation Limited, Power China"}}}
