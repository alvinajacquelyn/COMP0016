We focus on the changes in Prolog syntax within SWI-Prolog that accommodate greater syntactic integration, enhanced user experience and improved features for web-services. We recount the full syntax and functionality of Real as well as presenting a full application and sister packages which include Prolog code interfacing a number of common and useful tasks that can be delegated to R. We argue that Real is a powerful extension to logic programming, providing access to a popular statistical system that has complementary strengths in areas such as machine learning, statistical inference and visualisation. Furthermore, Real has a central role to play in the uptake of semantic web, computational biology and bioinformatics as application areas for research in logic programming.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bioinformatics", "Graph drawing", "Logic programming", "Machine learning", "R statistical computing", "Visualisation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Application area", "Computational biology", "Graph drawing", "Statistical computing", "Statistical inference", "Statistical systems", "Syntactic integration", "User experience"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978370502", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8647264200": {"Name": "Angelopoulos N.", "AuthorID": "8647264200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Division of Cancer, Imperial College"}, "22133928800": {"Name": "Giamas G.", "AuthorID": "22133928800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery and Cancer, Division of Cancer, Imperial College"}, "11540522000": {"Name": "Abdallah S.", "AuthorID": "11540522000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College"}}}
