As early as 1892, the great neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal studied the morphological development of MG, defining several steps in their morphogenesis [1,2]. However, the molecular cues controlling these developmental steps remain poorly understood. As MG have roles to play in every cellular and plexiform layer, this review discusses our current understanding on how MG morphology may be linked to their function, including the developmental mechanisms involved in MG patterning and morphogenesis. Uncovering the mechanisms governing glial morphogenesis, using transcriptomics and imaging, may provide shed new light on the pathophysiology and treatment of human neurological disorders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Ependymoglial Cells", "Humans", "Morphogenesis", "Retina"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028308872", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57199302770": {"Name": "MacDonald R.B.", "AuthorID": "57199302770", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60008750", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease, Medical School and Bateson Centre, University of Sheffield"}, "23466565400": {"Name": "Charlton-Perkins M.", "AuthorID": "23466565400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57203693369": {"Name": "Harris W.A.", "AuthorID": "57203693369", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}}}
