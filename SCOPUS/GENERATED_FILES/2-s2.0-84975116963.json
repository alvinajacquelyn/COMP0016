The objective was to determine the effect of NF and motor training (MOT) alone on motor and non-motor functions in Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) in a 10-week small Phase I randomized controlled trial. Methods: Thirty patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD; Hoehn and Yahr I-III) and no significant comorbidity took part in the trial with random allocation to two groups. Group 1 (NF: 15 patients) received rt-fMRI-NF with MOT. Group 2 (MOT: 15 patients) received MOT alone. The primary outcome measure was the Movement Disorder Society\u2014Unified PD Rating Scale-Motor scale (MDS-UPDRS-MS), administered pre- and post-intervention \u201coff-medication\u201d. The secondary outcome measures were the \u201con-medication\u201d MDS-UPDRS, the PD Questionnaire-39, and quantitative motor assessments after 4 and 10 weeks. Results: Patients in the NF group were able to upregulate activity in the supplementary motor area (SMA) by using motor imagery. They improved by an average of 4.5 points on the MDS-UPDRS-MS in the \u201coff-medication\u201d state (95% confidence interval: \u22122.5 to \u22126.6), whereas the MOT group improved only by 1.9 points (95% confidence interval +3.2 to \u22126.8). The improvement in the intervention group meets the minimal clinically important difference which is also on par with other non-invasive therapies such as repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS). However, the improvement did not differ significantly between the groups. No adverse events were reported in either group. Interpretation: This Phase I study suggests that NF combined with MOT is safe and improves motor symptoms immediately after treatment, but larger trials are needed to explore its superiority over active control conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Motor training", "Neurofeedback", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging", "WiiFit"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975116963", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"36137954600": {"Name": "Subramanian L.", "AuthorID": "36137954600", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre, School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "57189764289": {"Name": "Morris M.B.", "AuthorID": "57189764289", "AffiliationID": "60023998, 60170145", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University"}, "7102905437": {"Name": "Linden D.E.J.", "AuthorID": "7102905437", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff University Brain Research Imaging Centre, School of Psychology, Cardiff University"}, "57208503146": {"Name": "Brosnan M.", "AuthorID": "57208503146", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience, Maastricht University"}, "7402934667": {"Name": "Turner D.L.", "AuthorID": "7402934667", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "Neurorehabilitation Unit, School of Health, Sport and Bioscience, University of East London"}, "7401534782": {"Name": "Morris H.R.", "AuthorID": "7401534782", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
