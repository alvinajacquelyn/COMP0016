Furthermore, there is still debate as to the phase of iron present in the inner core, particularly when alloying with nickel and light elements is taken into account. To investigate the extent to which the mismatch between seismology and mineral physics is a function of either crystal structure and/or the amount of nickel present, we have used ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the elastic constants and seismic velocities (Vp and Vs) of face centred cubic (fcc) iron at Earth's inner core pressures (360 GPa) and at temperatures up to ~7000 K. We find that Vp for fcc iron (fcc-Fe) is very similar to that for hexagonal close packed (hcp) iron at all temperatures. In contrast, Vs for fcc-Fe is significantly higher than in hcp-Fe, with the difference increasing with increasing temperature; the difference between Vs for the core (from seismology) and Vs for fcc-Fe exceeds 40 per cent. These results are consistent with previous work at lower temperatures. We have also investigated the effect of 6.5 and 13 atm% Ni in fcc-Fe. We find that Ni only slightly reduces Vp and Vs (e.g. by 2 per cent in Vs for 13 atm% Ni at 5500 K), and cannot account for the difference between the velocities observed in the core and those of pure fcc-Fe. We also tried to examine pre-melting behaviour in fcc-Fe, as reported in hcp-Fe by extending the study to very high temperatures (at which superheating may occur). However, we find that fcc-Fe spontaneously transforms to other hcp-like structures before melting; two hcp-like structures were found, both of hexagonal symmetry, which may most easily be regarded as being derived from an hcp crystal with stacking faults. That the structure did not transform to a true hcp phase is likely as a consequence of the limited size of the simulation box (108 atoms). At 360 GPa, in pure fcc-Fe, we find that the transition from fcc to the hcp-like structure occurs at 7000 K, whereas in the Ni bearing system, the transition occurs at higher temperature (7250 K). This reinforces previous work showing that fcc-Fe might transform to hcp-Fe just before melting, and that Ni tends to stabilize the fcc structure with respect to hcp.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Core, outer core and inner core", "Elasticity and anelasticity", "High-pressure behaviour", "Mechanics, theory, and modelling", "Phase transitions", "Wave propagation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation", "Core , outer core and inner cores", "Elasticity and anelasticity", "Hexagonal close-packed irons", "High pressure behaviour", "Increasing temperatures", "Mechanics , theory , and modelling", "Shear wave velocity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962173539", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"26531498000": {"Name": "Martorell B.", "AuthorID": "26531498000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7004463552": {"Name": "Brodholt J.", "AuthorID": "7004463552", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7102583827": {"Name": "Wood I.", "AuthorID": "7102583827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6603903752": {"Name": "Vo\u010dadlo L.", "AuthorID": "6603903752", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
