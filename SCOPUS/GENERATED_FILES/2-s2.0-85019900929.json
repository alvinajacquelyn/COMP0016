In order to investigate this, information on the structural changes, in particular cracked particles, caused by the failure are desirable. For a reliable analysis of these changes a reasonably large amount of data is necessary, which necessitates automatic extraction of particle cracks from tomographic 3D image data. In this paper, a classification model is proposed which is able to decide whether a pair of particles is the result of breakage, of the image segmentation, or neither. The classifier is developed using simulated data based on a 3D stochastic particle model. Its validity is tested by applying the methodology to hand-labelled data from a real electrode. For this dataset, an overall accuracy of 73% is achieved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D microstructure", "Crack detection", "Lithium-ion battery", "Machine learning", "Stochastic modelling", "Thermal runaway"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D microstructures", "Automatic extraction", "Classification models", "Cracked particles", "Overall accuracies", "Particle microstructure", "Stochastic particle model", "Thermal runaways"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019900929", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57194392171": {"Name": "Petrich L.", "AuthorID": "57194392171", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Stochastics, Ulm University"}, "56458083300": {"Name": "Westhoff D.", "AuthorID": "56458083300", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Stochastics, Ulm University"}, "56208765300": {"Name": "Feinauer J.", "AuthorID": "56208765300", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Stochastics, Ulm University"}, "7202394043": {"Name": "Schmidt V.", "AuthorID": "7202394043", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Stochastics, Ulm University"}, "56613490600": {"Name": "Finegan D.", "AuthorID": "56613490600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57191666829": {"Name": "Daemi S.", "AuthorID": "57191666829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
