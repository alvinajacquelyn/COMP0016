Hence new forms of organisation are needed. Collaborating with Building Information Modelling (BIM) is complex and challenges the management of projects. The ubiquitous digital information sharing among multi-disciplinary actors in BIM-based projects, activates dense inter-organisational processes. This study offers insights into collaboration with BIM, through the theoretical lens of boundaries. By analysing two projects of BIM-based collaboration in the Netherlands, the interplay between structure and agency of collaboration was discussed. The various artefacts of BIM, as boundary objects were interpreted in multiple ways by different communities of practice and this resulted in poor communication and consequently poor collaboration. The findings challenge the prevalent view of BIM as a software artefact and showed that this view only partially supports collaboration. Additionally, a structurational view (enabled by communication, conflict management, negotiation, and teamwork) as opposed to a structural view of collaboration (e.g. BIM as a software) can fully support the implementation of digital innovations. Finally, the paper revealed a \u2018tactical gap\u2019 in the implementation of digital between strategic and operational decision-making needs fine-tuning to ensure better collaboration in projects where digital innovations are adopted. The study concludes with propositions for supporting organisation of teams through integration of activities and the management of BIM-based collaboration in projects beyond merely structural and technological approaches, which dominate the field but from a structurational view instead.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary theory", "Building Information Modelling (BIM)", "Collaboration", "Digital", "Structuration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary theories", "Building Information Modelling", "Collaboration", "Digital", "Structuration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061406205", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"56367767700": {"Name": "Papadonikolaki E.", "AuthorID": "56367767700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6602909369": {"Name": "van Oel C.", "AuthorID": "6602909369", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Delft University of Technology"}, "9638362000": {"Name": "Kagioglou M.", "AuthorID": "9638362000", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield"}}}
