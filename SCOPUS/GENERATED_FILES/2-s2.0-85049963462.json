We further combine additional practical concerns such as waveform modulus and extended target matched illumination to improve detection performance in dynamic interference environments. The impetus for the straightforward, yet suboptimal, strategy are the low cost drivers for small sensing platforms, such as small unmanned aerial systems (SUAS). Herein, we discuss a complete strategy and algorithm for sensing the environment, interrogating the target response and adapting the transmitted waveform to avoid the primary users while putting more energy on target than previous non-adaptive strategies. We give simulation results and initial experimental results to corroborate the theoretical and simulated findings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive strategy", "Detection performance", "Extended targets", "Interference environments", "Sensing platforms", "Spectrum usage", "Target response", "Unmanned aerial systems"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049963462", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"56874817400": {"Name": "Jones A.", "AuthorID": "56874817400", "AffiliationID": "60026242", "AffiliationName": "Radar Sensing Team, Defence Science and Technology Laboratory"}, "57197653103": {"Name": "Horne C.", "AuthorID": "57197653103", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202821654": {"Name": "Griffiths H.", "AuthorID": "7202821654", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55502024700": {"Name": "Smith G.", "AuthorID": "55502024700", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Ohio State University"}, "57188857047": {"Name": "Mitchell A.", "AuthorID": "57188857047", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Ohio State University"}, "57202449687": {"Name": "John-Baptiste P.", "AuthorID": "57202449687", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Ohio State University"}}}
