All rights reserved.Programmed cell death-1 (PD1) has become a significant target for cancer immunotherapy. PD1 and its receptor programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) are key regulatory physiological immune checkpoints that maintain self-tolerance in the organism by regulating the degree of activation of T and B cells amongst other immune cell types. However, cancer cells take advantage of these immunosuppressive regulatory mechanisms to escape T and B cell-mediated immunity. PD1 engagement on T cells by PDL1 on the surface of cancer cells dramatically interferes with T cell activation and the acquisition of effector capacities. Interestingly, PD1-targeted therapies have demonstrated to be highly effective in rescuing T cell anti-tumor effector functions. Amongst these the use of anti-PD1/PDL1 monoclonal antibodies are particularly efficacious in human therapies. Furthermore, clinical findings with PD1/PDL1 blockers over several cancer types demonstrate clinical benefit. Despite the successful results, the molecular mechanisms by which PD1-targeted therapies rescue T cell functions still remain elusive. Therefore, it is a key issue to uncover the molecular pathways by which these therapies exert its function in T cells. A profound knowledge of PDL1/PD1 mechanisms will surely uncover a new array of targets susceptible of therapeutic intervention. Here, we provide an overview of the molecular events underlying PD1-dependent T cell suppression in cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Immune checkpoint inhibitors", "Immunotherapy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030555725", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57195282780": {"Name": "Zuazo M.", "AuthorID": "57195282780", "AffiliationID": "114283616", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre of Navarra-Navarrabiomed, IdISNA"}, "56907057300": {"Name": "Gato-Ca\u00f1as M.", "AuthorID": "56907057300", "AffiliationID": "114283616", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre of Navarra-Navarrabiomed, IdISNA"}, "57195964651": {"Name": "Llorente N.", "AuthorID": "57195964651", "AffiliationID": "114283616", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre of Navarra-Navarrabiomed, IdISNA"}, "36632090300": {"Name": "Iba\u00f1ez-Vea M.", "AuthorID": "36632090300", "AffiliationID": "114283616", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre of Navarra-Navarrabiomed, IdISNA"}, "56907020800": {"Name": "Arasanz H.", "AuthorID": "56907020800", "AffiliationID": "114283616", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre of Navarra-Navarrabiomed, IdISNA"}, "26649509700": {"Name": "Kochan G.", "AuthorID": "26649509700", "AffiliationID": "114283616", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Centre of Navarra-Navarrabiomed, IdISNA"}, "6507259181": {"Name": "Escors D.", "AuthorID": "6507259181", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rayne Institute, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
