When exploring virtual environments larger than room-scale, it is often desirable to increase users\u2019 perceived walking speed, for which we investigate three methods. (1) Ground-Level Scaling increases users\u2019 avatar size, allowing them to walk farther. (2) Eye-Level Scaling enables users to walk through a World in Miniature, while maintaining a street-level view. (3) Seven-League Boots amplifies users\u2019 movements along their walking path. We conduct a study comparing these methods and find that users feel most embodied using Ground-Level Scaling and consequently increase their stride length. Using Seven-League Boots, unlike the other two methods, diminishes positional accuracy at high gains, and users modify their walking behavior to compensate for the lack of control. We conclude with a discussion on each technique\u2019s strength and weaknesses and the types of situation they might be appropriate for.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body scale", "Locomotion", "Seven-league boots", "Translational gain", "Virtual reality", "Walking speed", "World in miniuature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Body scale", "Seven-league boots", "Translational gain", "Walking speed", "World in miniuature"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067625381", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57209395634": {"Name": "Abtahi P.", "AuthorID": "57209395634", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University"}, "36080251200": {"Name": "Gonzalez-Franco M.", "AuthorID": "36080251200", "AffiliationID": "60021726", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "10139546600": {"Name": "Ofek E.", "AuthorID": "10139546600", "AffiliationID": "60021726", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "18435050200": {"Name": "Steed A.", "AuthorID": "18435050200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
