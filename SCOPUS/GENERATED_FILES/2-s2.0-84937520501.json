IgG persistence may influence long-term protection. Methods: An observational, prospective, longitudinal study of nasopharyngeal carriage among American Indian households from 2006 to 2008 evaluated long-term immunogenicity of 7-valent PCV (PCV7). Children unimmunized with PCV were age-matched to those PCV7 immunized at least 4 years prior (ratio 1:3 or 1:4). Blood collected at the final study visit was analyzed for PCV7 serotype IgG (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and for functional activity (multiplex-opsonophagocytic assay) for serotypes 4, 6B, 14 and 23F. Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs), titers (GMTs) and the odds of serotype-specific IgG \u22650.35 \u03bcg/mL were compared according to immunization status using a matched regression approach. Results: Eight unimmunized and 28 immunized children age-matched at the time of serum collection (mean age: 7.9 years) were included. Serotype-specific GMCs, GMTs and proportions above the correlate of protection did not differ between the groups except for serotypes 14 and 23F. Serotype 14 GMCs (immunized 0.7 vs. unimmunized 0.2; P = 0.02) and serotype 23F GMTs (immunized 388.3 vs. unimmunized 47.8; P = 0.03) were significantly higher among immunized children. IgG concentrations and functional titers among immunized children were strongly correlated for serotypes 4 (r = 0.78; P \u2264 0.001) and 14 (r = 0.52; P \u2264 0.01). Conclusions: PCV serotype-specific IgG concentrations 4 years following PCV vaccination do not persist above natural levels for most serotypes. Exposure to pneumococcus may be critical in maintaining persistent serotype-specific IgG; the elimination of circulating vaccine type pneumococci by PCV may have effects on long-term immunity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["American Indian", "antibody", "IgG persistence", "PCV", "pneumococcal conjugate vaccine", "pneumococcus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Bacterial", "Child", "Female", "Heptavalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine", "Humans", "Immunization", "Immunoglobulin G", "Indians, North American", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Pneumococcal Infections", "Prospective Studies", "Streptococcus pneumoniae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937520501", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"35285561300": {"Name": "Grant L.R.", "AuthorID": "35285561300", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Center for American Indian Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7401757793": {"Name": "Reid R.", "AuthorID": "7401757793", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Center for American Indian Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7005381058": {"Name": "Santosham M.", "AuthorID": "7005381058", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Center for American Indian Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"}, "7202076842": {"Name": "O'Brien K.L.", "AuthorID": "7202076842", "AffiliationID": "60006183, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Center for American Indian Health, Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University"}, "12800754300": {"Name": "Burbidge P.", "AuthorID": "12800754300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute Child Health, University College London"}, "36720898900": {"Name": "Haston M.", "AuthorID": "36720898900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute Child Health, University College London"}, "7406604503": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "7406604503", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute Child Health, University College London"}, "7102190212": {"Name": "Goldblatt D.", "AuthorID": "7102190212", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute Child Health, University College London"}}}
