We report here, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an electrically pumped, room-temperature, continuous-wave (CW) and single-mode distributed feedback laser array fabricated in InAs/GaAs quantum-dot gain material epitaxially grown on silicon. CW threshold currents as low as 12 mA and single-mode side mode suppression ratios as high as 50 dB have been achieved from individual devices in the array. The laser array, compatible with state-of-the-art coarse wavelength division multiplexing (CWDM) systems, has a well-aligned channel spacing of 20 0.2 nm and exhibits a record wavelength covering range of 100 nm, the full span of the O-band. These results indicate that, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the performance of lasers epitaxially grown on silicon is elevated to a point approaching real-world CWDM applications, demonstrating the great potential of this technology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coarse wavelength division multiplexing", "Electrically pumped", "Electrically pumped lasers", "Individual devices", "Quantum dot distributed feedback lasers", "Side mode suppression ratios", "Silicon microelectronics", "Threshold currents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047251157", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57200063743": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "57200063743", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "55731485900": {"Name": "Yu Y.", "AuthorID": "55731485900", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57188692719": {"Name": "Zhou L.", "AuthorID": "57188692719", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57188691249": {"Name": "Liu L.", "AuthorID": "57188691249", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57188678448": {"Name": "Yang C.", "AuthorID": "57188678448", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technologies, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "57199322085": {"Name": "Yu S.", "AuthorID": "57199322085", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "54939079100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "54939079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57190436073": {"Name": "Liao M.", "AuthorID": "57190436073", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202133987": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "57202133987", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56801227500": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "56801227500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "7202066975": {"Name": "Ross I.", "AuthorID": "7202066975", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield"}}}
