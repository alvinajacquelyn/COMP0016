Methods: The authors conducted a systematic review of literature evaluating psychosocial and psychological interventions for depression and anxiety in patients with AMD. Primary searches of PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, Global Health, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Science Direct were conducted to include all articles published up to April 21, 2018. Results: Of a total of 398 citations retrieved, the authors selected 12 eligible studies published between 2002 and 2016. The authors found nine randomized controlled trials (RCT), and three non-randomized intervention (NRI) studies. RCT studies suggested that interventions using group self-management techniques and individual behavioral activation plus low vision rehabilitation can be effective to treat and prevent depression in patients with AMD, and one study suggested that a stepped-care intervention using cognitive-behavioral techniques can be effective to manage anxiety and depression over time. NRI studies highlighted a positive effect of self-help and emotion-focused interventions to reduce depression. Conclusion: Clinical practice with patients with AMD can rely on some tailored cognitive-behavioral therapeutic protocols to improve patients\u2019 mental health, but further clinical trials will generate the necessary evidence-based knowledge to improve those therapeutic techniques and offer additional tailored interventions for patients with AMD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["age-related macular degeneration", "anxiety", "depression", "psychological intervention", "Psychosocial intervention", "vision disorders"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Depression", "Humans", "Macular Degeneration", "Psychotherapy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064323190", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"54685200600": {"Name": "Senra H.", "AuthorID": "54685200600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "25650174300": {"Name": "Macedo A.F.", "AuthorID": "25650174300", "AffiliationID": "60104372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Optometry, Linnaeus University"}, "57194271213": {"Name": "Nunes N.", "AuthorID": "57194271213", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Porto"}, "57208273519": {"Name": "Costa E.", "AuthorID": "57208273519", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Psychology, Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, University of Porto"}, "35221042600": {"Name": "Balaskas K.", "AuthorID": "35221042600", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7003670895": {"Name": "Aslam T.", "AuthorID": "7003670895", "AffiliationID": "60023665, 60120605", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Royal Eye Hospital, Central Manchester Foundation Trust"}}}
