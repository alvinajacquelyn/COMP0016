Retrieving objects from memory reinstates components of this activity. In humans, the temporal structure of this retrieved activity remains largely unexplored, and here we address this gap using the spatiotemporal precision of magnetoencephalography (MEG). In a sensory preconditioning paradigm, 'indirect' objects were paired with 'direct' objects to form associative links, and the latter were then paired with rewards. Using multivariate analysis methods we examined the short-time evolution of neural representations of indirect objects retrieved during reward-learning about direct objects. We found two components of the evoked representation of the indirect stimulus, 200 ms apart. The strength of retrieval of one, but not the other, representational component correlated with generalization of reward learning from direct to indirect stimuli. We suggest the temporal structure within retrieved neural representations may be key to their function.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Association Learning", "Behavior", "Evoked Potentials", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male", "Memory", "Multivariate Analysis", "Photic Stimulation", "Task Performance and Analysis", "Time Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964695586", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"21833994400": {"Name": "Kurth-Nelson Z.", "AuthorID": "21833994400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research, University College London"}, "24725805500": {"Name": "Sejdinovic D.", "AuthorID": "24725805500", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
