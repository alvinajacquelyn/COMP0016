Diebold and Yilmaz\u2019s original method is improved by using exponentially weighted daily returns as well as ridge regularization on vector autoregression (VAR) and forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD). We compute the total network connectedness for each of the three banking systems, which quantifies regional uncertainty. Results over rolling windows of 300 days during the period from January 2005 to October 2015 reveal changing uncertainty patterns that are similar across regions, demonstrating common peaks associated with identifiable exogenous events. Lead\u2013 lag relationships among changes of total network connectedness of the three systems, quantified by transfer entropy, reveal that uncertainties in the three regional systems are significantly causally related, with the NA system having the largest influence on the EU and ASEAN.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Banking networks", "Connectedness", "Forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD)", "Spillover effects", "Systemic risk"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059806085", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Finance", "ECON", "2003"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57210620023": {"Name": "Tungsong S.", "AuthorID": "57210620023", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}, "24775109100": {"Name": "Caccioli F.", "AuthorID": "24775109100", "AffiliationID": "100651912", "AffiliationName": "London Mathematical Laboratory"}, "7003460450": {"Name": "Aste T.", "AuthorID": "7003460450", "AffiliationID": "60003059, 60159833", "AffiliationName": "Systemic Risk Centre, London School of Economics and Political Sciences"}}}
