However, recently excavations at two adjacent caves at Moghr el-Ahwal in the Qadisha Valley of northern Lebanon have provided a rich record, particularly of hunting and trapping strategies from the period following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) until the B\u00f8lling/Aller\u00f8d interstadial. The dominant prey species, which varied in proportions through time, included: wild goat; roe, red and fallow deer; as well as fox, hare, squirrel and partridge. These document the exploitation of a wide spectrum of habitats, and demonstrate the expansion of forest cover through this period. Comparisons are made with food procurement strategies through the Epipalaeolithic in the wider region.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epipalaeolithic", "hunting strategies", "Lebanon", "Levant", "Moghr el-Ahwal", "Natufian"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038618107", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57189067147": {"Name": "Edwards Y.", "AuthorID": "57189067147", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "6506118444": {"Name": "Garrard A.", "AuthorID": "6506118444", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57200007488": {"Name": "Yazbeck C.", "AuthorID": "57200007488", "AffiliationID": "60068774", "AffiliationName": "Lebanese University"}}}
