Methods: Ninety-five individuals from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention were included in these cross-sectional analyses. They were genotyped for APOE4, CLU, and ABCA7, from which a PRS was calculated for each participant. The participants underwent lumbar puncture for CSF collection. b-Amyloid 42 (Ab42), Ab40, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (ptau) were quantified by immunoassays, and Ab42/Ab40 and tau/Ab42 ratios were computed. CRF was estimated from a validated equation incorporating sex, age, body mass index, resting heart rate, and self-reported physical activity. Covariate-adjusted regression analyses were used to test for associations between the PRS and CSF biomarkers. In addition, by including a PRS3CRF term in the models, we examined whether these associations were modified by CRF. Results: A higher PRS was associated with lower Ab42/Ab40 (p , 0.001), higher t-tau/Ab42 (p 5 0.012), and higher p-tau/Ab42 (p 5 0.040). Furthermore, we observed PRS 3 CRF interactions for Ab42/Ab40 (p 5 0.003), t-tau/Ab42 (p 5 0.003), and p-tau/Ab42 (p 5 0.001). Specifically, the association between the PRS and these CSF biomarkers was diminished in those with higher CRF. Conclusions: In a late-middle-aged cohort, CRF attenuates the adverse influence of genetic vulnerability on CSF biomarkers. These findings support the notion that increased cardiorespiratory fitness may be beneficial to those at increased genetic risk for AD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Biomarkers", "Cardiorespiratory Fitness", "Clusterin", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multifactorial Inheritance", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Registries", "Risk", "tau Proteins", "Wisconsin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019790732", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56382037300": {"Name": "Schultz S.A.", "AuthorID": "56382037300", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center"}, "56382403900": {"Name": "Boots E.A.", "AuthorID": "56382403900", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center"}, "7103143605": {"Name": "Carlsson C.M.", "AuthorID": "7103143605", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "35810019900": {"Name": "Gallagher C.L.", "AuthorID": "35810019900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "16836159200": {"Name": "Bendlin B.B.", "AuthorID": "16836159200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7006820761": {"Name": "Asthana S.", "AuthorID": "7006820761", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7406327695": {"Name": "Johnson S.C.", "AuthorID": "7406327695", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "15049910000": {"Name": "Okonkwo O.C.", "AuthorID": "15049910000", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer's Institute"}, "7403472306": {"Name": "Cook D.B.", "AuthorID": "7403472306", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Kinesiology, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "7404087309": {"Name": "Edwards D.F.", "AuthorID": "7404087309", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "23994091600": {"Name": "Koscik R.L.", "AuthorID": "23994091600", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center"}, "56765495500": {"Name": "Sager M.A.", "AuthorID": "56765495500", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "35508201800": {"Name": "Hermann B.P.", "AuthorID": "35508201800", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6602567647": {"Name": "Engelman C.D.", "AuthorID": "6602567647", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "54905945600": {"Name": "Darst B.F.", "AuthorID": "54905945600", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Health Sciences, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "118445075", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60025553, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Wisconsin, School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "11839002200": {"Name": "Hogan K.J.", "AuthorID": "11839002200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}}}
