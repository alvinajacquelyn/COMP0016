This provides the potential for improved separation of the photopeaks in dual radionuclide imaging, such as combined use of 99mTc and 123I . There is, however, the added complexity of tailing effects in the detectors that must be accounted for. In this paper we present a model-based correction algorithm which extracts the useful primary counts of 99mTc and 123I from projection data. Equations describing the in-patient scatter and tailing effects in the detectors are iteratively solved for both radionuclides simultaneously using a maximum a posteriori probability algorithm with one-step-late evaluation. Energy window-dependent parameters for the equations describing in-patient scatter are estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. Parameters for the equations describing tailing effects are estimated using virtually scatter-free experimental measurements on a dedicated cardiac SPECT camera with CdZnTe-detectors. When applied to a phantom study with both 99mTc and 123I, results show that the estimated spatial distribution of events from 99mTc in the 99mTc photopeak energy window is very similar to that measured in a single 99mTc phantom study. The extracted images of primary events display increased cold lesion contrasts for both 99mTc and 123I.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CdZnTe detectors", "Dedicated cardiac spect", "Energy resolutions", "Maximum a posteriori probability algorithm", "Model-based corrections", "Photopeak energy", "Radionuclide imaging", "Tailing effects", "Algorithms", "Cadmium", "Heart", "Humans", "Iodine Radioisotopes", "Models, Theoretical", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Radiopharmaceuticals", "Technetium", "Tellurium", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", "Zinc"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927614214", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35434955000": {"Name": "Holstensson M.", "AuthorID": "35434955000", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "7003356996": {"Name": "Erlandsson K.", "AuthorID": "7003356996", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}, "55579699800": {"Name": "Ben-Haim S.", "AuthorID": "55579699800", "AffiliationID": "60011766", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Chaim Sheba Medical Center"}, "7005479075": {"Name": "Hutton B.F.", "AuthorID": "7005479075", "AffiliationID": "60011664", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong"}, "55939030800": {"Name": "Poludniowski G.", "AuthorID": "55939030800", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics, Karolinska University Hospital"}}}
