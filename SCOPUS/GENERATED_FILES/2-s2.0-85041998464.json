Following challenges with recruitment, our aim was to understand more fully healthcare professionals' perspectives of the challenges of recruiting young people to a low-risk observational study, and to provide guidance for future recruitment processes. Design Qualitative. Setting National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England. Methods Semistructured telephone interviews with a convenience sample of 23 healthcare professionals. Participants included principal investigators/other staff recruiting into the BRIGHTLIGHT study. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Results The emergent themes were linked to levels of research organisational management, described using the levels of social network analysis: micro-level (the individual; in this case the target population to be recruited - young people with cancer); meso-level (the organisation; refers to place of recruitment and people responsible for recruitment); and macro-level (the large-scale or global structure; refers to the wider research function of the NHS and associated policies). Study-related issues occurred across all three levels, which were influenced by the context of the study. At the meso-level, professionals' perceptions of young people and communication between professionals generated age/cancer type silos, resulting in recruitment of either children or adults, but not both by the same team, and only in the cancer type the recruiting professional was aligned to. At the macro-level the main barrier was discordant configuration of a research service with a clinical service. Conclusions This study has identified significant barriers to recruitment mainly at the meso-level and macro-level, which are more challenging for research teams to influence. We suggest that interconnected whole-system changes are required to facilitate the success of interventions designed to improve recruitment. Interventions targeted at study design/management and the micro-level only may be less successful. We offer solutions to be considered by those involved at all levels of research for this population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brightlight", "cancer", "recruitment", "research", "teenager", "young adult"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Data Collection", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Neoplasms", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Patient Selection", "Qualitative Research", "State Medicine", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041998464", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"36240503300": {"Name": "Kenten C.", "AuthorID": "36240503300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57054859300": {"Name": "Martins A.", "AuthorID": "57054859300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23979721800": {"Name": "Fern L.A.", "AuthorID": "23979721800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56669433600": {"Name": "Lea S.", "AuthorID": "56669433600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55158448800": {"Name": "Ngwenya N.", "AuthorID": "55158448800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202609757": {"Name": "Whelan J.S.", "AuthorID": "7202609757", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57202910374": {"Name": "Taylor R.M.", "AuthorID": "57202910374", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101616129": {"Name": "Gibson F.", "AuthorID": "7101616129", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health, Illness and Disability (ORCHID), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
