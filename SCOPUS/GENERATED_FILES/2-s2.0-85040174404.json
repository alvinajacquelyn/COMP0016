Although these processes may be modelled by separate multistate models, the processes are likely to be correlated within patients. Motivated by the lupus nephritis application, we develop a new multistate modelling framework where subject-specific random effects are introduced to account for the correlations both between the processes and within patients over time. Models are fitted by using bespoke code in standard statistical software. A variety of forms for the random effects are introduced and evaluated by using the data from the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Continuous time Markov model", "Multistate model", "Multivariate longitudinal data", "Random effects"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040174404", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"]], "AuthorData": {"57188737908": {"Name": "O\u2019Keeffe A.G.", "AuthorID": "57188737908", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56865168700": {"Name": "Su L.", "AuthorID": "56865168700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "7005718187": {"Name": "Farewell V.T.", "AuthorID": "7005718187", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}}}
