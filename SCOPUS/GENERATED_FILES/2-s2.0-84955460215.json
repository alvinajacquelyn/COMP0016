Natural light from the sun, and from candles, was initially harnessed using mirrors. Later, the invention of limelight and electricity preceded the emergence of the modern-day endoscope, which, in tandem with the discovery of coherent fibre-optics in the 1950s, significantly expanded the surgical repertoire available to otolaryngologists. This study aimed to trace the rich history of ENT through the specialty's use of light.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endoscopy", "History Of Medicine", "Light", "Otolaryngology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical Technology", "Fiber Optic Technology", "Humans", "Lighting", "Otolaryngology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955460215", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"56104213000": {"Name": "Mozaffari M.", "AuthorID": "56104213000", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department, St. Mary's Hospital"}, "8507713200": {"Name": "Fishman J.", "AuthorID": "8507713200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department, University College London"}, "7003967365": {"Name": "Tolley N.", "AuthorID": "7003967365", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "ENT Department, St. Mary's Hospital"}}}
