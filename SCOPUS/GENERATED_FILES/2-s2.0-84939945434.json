With a pathological hallmark of alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs; Papp\u2013Lantos inclusions), MSA patients exhibit marked neurodegenerative changes in the striatonigral and/or olivopontocerebellar structures of the brain. As a member of the alpha-synucleinopathy family, which is defined by its well-demarcated alpha-synuclein-immunoreactive inclusions and aggregation, MSA\u2019s clinical presentation exhibits several overlapping features with other members including Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Given the extensive fund of knowledge regarding the genetic etiology of PD revealed within the past several years, a genetic investigation of MSA is warranted. While a current genome-wide association study is underway for MSA to further clarify the role of associated genetic loci and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, several cases have presented solid preliminary evidence of a genetic etiology. Naturally, genes and variants manifesting known associations with PD (and other phenotypically similar neurodegenerative disorders), including SNCA and MAPT, have been comprehensively investigated in MSA patient cohorts. More recently variants in COQ2 have been linked to MSA in the Japanese population although this finding awaits replication. Nonetheless, significant positive associations with subsequent independent replication studies have been scarce. With very limited information regarding genetic mutations or alterations in gene dosage as a cause of MSA, the search for novel risk genes, which may be in the form of common variants or rare variants, is the logical nexus for MSA research. We believe that the application of next generation genetic methods to MSA will provide valuable insight into the underlying causes of this disease, and will be central to the identification of etiologic-based therapies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Genetic risk", "Genome-wide association", "Linkage analysis", "Mutation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkyl and Aryl Transferases", "alpha-Synuclein", "Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Genetic Linkage", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Lewy Body Disease", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Mutation", "Parkinson Disease"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939945434", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"25929874000": {"Name": "Federoff M.", "AuthorID": "25929874000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006092717": {"Name": "Singleton A.", "AuthorID": "7006092717", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "36911788600": {"Name": "Schottlaender L.", "AuthorID": "36911788600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
