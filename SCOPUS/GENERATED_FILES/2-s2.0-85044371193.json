The same genus was later reported from the Upper Cretaceous of Bayan Mandahu, Nei Mongol, China on the basis of a partial skeleton showing some similarities in osteoderm morphology. Re-examination of this specimen with the aid of \u03bcCT scanning suggests that it is, in fact, attributable to Parmeosaurus, a scincoid lizard described from the Ukhaa Tolgod locality, Mongolia, as do two new specimens from Bayan Mandahu. Moreover, some of the Mongolian material originally attributed to Bainguis appears also to belong to Parmeosaurus. And our new phylogenetic analysis confirms that Parmeosaurus is positioned on the stem of Scincoidea. Taken together, these specimens add new data to our understanding of Parmeosaurus but also raise questions as to the affinities of Bainguis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bainguis", "China", "Gobi desert", "Late Cretaceous", "Parmeosaurus", "Taxonomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044371193", "SubjectAreas": [["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"54882250700": {"Name": "Dong L.", "AuthorID": "54882250700", "AffiliationID": "60012060, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences)"}, "7405294877": {"Name": "Xu X.", "AuthorID": "7405294877", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origin, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55733785900": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "55733785900", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Vertebrate Evolution and Human Origin, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7402709518": {"Name": "Evans S.", "AuthorID": "7402709518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
