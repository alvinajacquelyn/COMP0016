However, in order to deal with dynamic workloads, MEC is deployed in a large number of fixed-location micro-clouds, leading to resource wastage during stable/low workload periods. Limiting the number of micro-clouds improves resource utilization and saves operational costs, but faces service performance degradations due to insufficient physical capacity during peak time from nearby micro-clouds. To efficiently support services with low latency requirement under varying workload conditions, we adopt the emerging network function virtualization (NFV)-enabled MEC, which offers new flexibility in hosting MEC services in any virtualized network node, e.g., access points, routers, etc. This flexibility overcomes the limitations imposed by fixed-location solutions, providing new freedom in terms of MEC service-hosting locations. In this paper, we address the questions on where and when to allocate resources as well as how many resources to be allocated among NFV-enabled MECs, such that both the low latency requirements of mobile services and MEC cost efficiency are achieved. We propose a dynamic resource allocation framework that consists of a fast heuristic-based incremental allocation mechanism that dynamically performs resource allocation and a reoptimization algorithm that periodically adjusts allocation to maintain a near-optimal MEC operational cost over time. We show through extensive simulations that our flexible framework always manages to allocate sufficient resources in time to guarantee continuous satisfaction of applications' low latency requirements. At the same time, our proposal saves up to 33% of cost in comparison to existing fixed-location MEC solutions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["approximation algorithm", "dynamic resource allocation", "low latency applications", "Mobile edge-cloud"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic resource allocations", "Dynamic scheduling", "Edge clouds", "Low latency", "Mobile communications", "Resource management"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040554325", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56508663000": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "56508663000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14041390300": {"Name": "Chai W.", "AuthorID": "14041390300", "AffiliationID": "60029336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Informatics, Bournemouth University"}, "7405426909": {"Name": "Xu Z.", "AuthorID": "7405426909", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "School of Software, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57188821228": {"Name": "Katsaros K.", "AuthorID": "57188821228", "AffiliationID": "60057758", "AffiliationName": "Intracom Telecom"}}}
