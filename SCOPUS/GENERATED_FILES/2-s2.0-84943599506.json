We examine the willingness to adopt prepayment metering (PPM) for a sample of Nigerian households that were not prepayment users. Double-hurdle models were estimated to account for households' decisions concerning billing system switching behaviour and households' willingness to pay (WTP). The estimated results revealed that decisions to adopt a prepayment meter are significantly affected by current electricity spending, current billing method and the split incentive problem. Whereas current electricity spending significantly increased the tendency to adopt PPM, the split incentive problem reduced the probability of adoption. Although unmetered consumers were more likely to express a willingness to adopt a PPM system than post-paid customers, they did not intend to pay a significantly higher amount to obtain the prepayment service. Income did not play a significant role in decision-making concerning PPM adoption and the corresponding WTP amount. These results cast doubt on the validity of the widely held belief that low income may be responsible for PPM adoption, reflecting the widespread usage of PPM by low-income households.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Double-hurdle model", "Electricity spending", "Nigeria", "Prepayment metering", "Willingness to adopt"], "IndexKeywords": ["Billing systems", "Double hurdle model", "Metering systems", "Nigeria", "Prepayment metering", "Split incentives", "Willingness to adopt", "Willingness to pay"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943599506", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"49964274000": {"Name": "Oseni M.", "AuthorID": "49964274000", "AffiliationID": "60112768, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Judge Business School, University of Cambridge"}}}
