The SPP approach is established on the basis of a baseline subtraction method using Rayleigh corrected top-of-atmosphere data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) measurements. It calculates the reflectance differences between phytoplankton related signals observed in the MERIS red and near infrared (NIR) bands, such as sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) and the backscattering at 709 nm, and considers the summation of the positive line heights for estimating Chl-a concentrations. The SPP algorithm is calibrated against near coincident in situ data collected from three types of phytoplankton dominant waters encountered in the Baltic Sea during 2010 (N = 379). The validation results show that the algorithm is capable of retrieving Chl-a concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3 mg m \u22123, with an RMSE of 0.24 mg m \u22123 (R2 = 0.69, N = 264). Additionally, the comparison results with several Chl-a algorithms demonstrates the robustness of the SPP approach and its sensitivity to low to medium biomass waters. Based on the red and NIR reflectance features, a flagging method is also proposed to distinguish intensive surface phytoplankton blooms from the background water.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Baltic Sea", "Chlorophyll-a", "MERIS", "Phytoplankton abundances", "Satellite remote sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Baltic sea", "Chlorophyll a", "MERIS", "Phytoplankton abundances", "Satellite remote sensing", "Chlorophyll", "Environmental Monitoring", "Phytoplankton", "Remote Sensing Technology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020045607", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57194417376": {"Name": "Zhang D.", "AuthorID": "57194417376", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Department of Space and Climate Physics"}, "7404871794": {"Name": "Muller J.P.", "AuthorID": "7404871794", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Department of Space and Climate Physics"}, "7202113648": {"Name": "Walton D.", "AuthorID": "7202113648", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London, Department of Space and Climate Physics"}, "7006531663": {"Name": "Lavender S.", "AuthorID": "7006531663", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Marine Science and Engineering, University of Plymouth"}, "7101628357": {"Name": "Karlson B.", "AuthorID": "7101628357", "AffiliationID": "60014318", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, Oceanographic Unit"}, "57191419749": {"Name": "Kronsell J.", "AuthorID": "57191419749", "AffiliationID": "60014318", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, Oceanographic Unit"}}}
