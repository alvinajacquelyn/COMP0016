Semen characteristics were compared between initial and consecutive ejaculate showing improved semen parameters: progressive grade A spermatozoa, morphology and sperm concentration. Median concentrations in initial and consecutive ejaculates were 10 million/ml and 17 million/ml, respectively. The second sample had a higher median normal morphology (7% versus 6%, P < 0.001). The median of non-progressive spermatozoa (Grade C) was significantly lower in the consecutive sample than the initial sample (0% versus 5%, P < 0.01). Medians for slow progression spermatozoa (B grade) and immotile spermatozoa (D grade) were lower in the consecutive samples (20% versus 13%, P < 0.01 and 60% versus 50%, P < 0.001, respectively). The median for rapid motility (Grade A) was significantly higher in the consecutive sample than the first (30% versus 5%, P < 0.001). Overall median progressive motility as benchmarked by the WHO 2010 criteria was significantly higher in the consecutive sample (43% versus 25%, P < 0.001). Semen analyses of consecutive semen samples collected 30 min (mean) apart in oligozoospemic men should be checked routinely for diagnostic purposes and for managing potential subfertility treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["abstinence", "consecutive ejaculate", "sperm parameters"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Ejaculation", "Humans", "Infertility, Male", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oligospermia", "Retrospective Studies", "Semen Analysis", "Sexual Abstinence", "Sperm Count", "Sperm Motility", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959363651", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"7003912215": {"Name": "Bahadur G.", "AuthorID": "7003912215", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, North Middlesex University Hospital, Old Admin Block, Sterling Way"}, "56755252100": {"Name": "Almossawi O.", "AuthorID": "56755252100", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, North Middlesex University Hospital, Old Admin Block, Sterling Way"}, "57041204000": {"Name": "Zeirideen Zaid R.", "AuthorID": "57041204000", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, North Middlesex University Hospital, Old Admin Block, Sterling Way"}, "56655172500": {"Name": "Ilahibuccus A.", "AuthorID": "56655172500", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, North Middlesex University Hospital, Old Admin Block, Sterling Way"}, "15520789500": {"Name": "Al-Habib A.", "AuthorID": "15520789500", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, North Middlesex University Hospital, Old Admin Block, Sterling Way"}, "7004319401": {"Name": "Okolo S.", "AuthorID": "7004319401", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine Unit, North Middlesex University Hospital, Old Admin Block, Sterling Way"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital Trust London"}}}
