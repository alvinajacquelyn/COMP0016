Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Introduction To progress towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC), countries will need to define a health benefits package of services free at the point of use. Financial risk protection is a core component of UHC and should therefore be considered a key dimension of health benefits packages. Allocative efficiency modelling tools can support national analytical capacity to inform an evidence-based selection of services, but none are currently able to estimate financial risk protection. A review of existing methods used to measure financial risk protection can facilitate their inclusion in modelling tools so that the latter can become more relevant to national decision making in light of UHC. Methods and analysis This protocol proposes to conduct a scoping review of existing methods used to measure financial risk protection and assess their potential to inform the selection of services in a health benefits package. The proposed review will follow the methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley and the subsequent recommendations made by Levac et al. Several databases will be systematically searched including: (1) PubMed; (2) Scopus; (3) Web of Science and (4) Google Scholar. Grey literature will also be scanned, and the bibliography of all selected studies will be hand searched. Following the selection of studies according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, key characteristics will be collected from the studies using a data extraction tool. Key characteristics will include the type of method used, geographical region of focus and application to specific services or packages. The extracted data will then be charted, collated, reported and summarised using descriptive statistics, a thematic analysis and graphical presentations. Ethics and dissemination The scoping review proposed in this protocol does not require ethical approval. The final results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal, conference presentations and shared with key stakeholders.", "AuthorKeywords": ["allocative efficiency modelling", "financial risk protection", "priority setting", "scoping review protocol", "universal health coverage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delivery of Health Care", "Humans", "Research Design", "Resource Allocation", "Review Literature as Topic", "Risk", "Risk Sharing, Financial", "Universal Health Insurance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066613696", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57209135350": {"Name": "Abou Jaoude G.J.", "AuthorID": "57209135350", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "26654536200": {"Name": "Skordis-Worrall J.", "AuthorID": "26654536200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "36647510000": {"Name": "Haghparast-Bidgoli H.", "AuthorID": "36647510000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}}}
