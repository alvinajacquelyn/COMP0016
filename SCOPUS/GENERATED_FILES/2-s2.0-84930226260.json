The increasing versatility and complexity of these implant designs request for concurrent advances in means to assess in vivo the course of induced bone formation in preclinical models. Since its discovery, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) has excelled as powerful high-resolution technique for non-invasive assessment of newly formed bone tissue. However, micro-CT fails to provide spatiotemporal information on biological processes ongoing during bone regeneration. Conversely, due to the versatile applicability and cost-effectiveness, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) would be an ideal technique for assessing such biological processes with high sensitivity and for nuclear imaging comparably high resolution (<1 mm). Herein, we employ modular designed poly(ethylene glycol)-based hydrogels that release bone morphogenetic protein to guide the healing of critical sized calvarial bone defects. By combined in vivo longitudinal multi-pinhole SPECT and micro-CT evaluations we determine the spatiotemporal course of bone formation and remodeling within this synthetic hydrogel implant. End point evaluations by high resolution micro-CT and histological evaluation confirm the value of this approach to follow and optimize bone-inducing biomaterials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bone and Bones", "Bone Morphogenetic Proteins", "Bone Regeneration", "Drug Carriers", "Female", "Hydrogels", "Hydroxyapatites", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930226260", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55766237800": {"Name": "Lienemann P.", "AuthorID": "55766237800", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Zurich"}, "55658842500": {"Name": "Metzger S.", "AuthorID": "55658842500", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Zurich"}, "55351713900": {"Name": "Kiveli\u00f6 A.", "AuthorID": "55351713900", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Zurich"}, "56662874500": {"Name": "Papageorgiou P.", "AuthorID": "56662874500", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Zurich"}, "7801536855": {"Name": "Ehrbar M.", "AuthorID": "7801536855", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Obstetrics, University Hospital Zurich"}, "7102118966": {"Name": "Blanc A.", "AuthorID": "7102118966", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Center for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences ETH-PSI-USZ, Paul Scherrer Institute, OIPA/103"}, "7004423255": {"Name": "Schibli R.", "AuthorID": "7004423255", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zurich"}, "26643271900": {"Name": "B\u00e9h\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "26643271900", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Center for Radiopharmaceutical Sciences ETH-PSI-USZ, Paul Scherrer Institute, OIPA/103"}, "55985279700": {"Name": "Astolfo A.", "AuthorID": "55985279700", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute"}, "18038131200": {"Name": "Pinzer B.", "AuthorID": "18038131200", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute"}, "7003508597": {"Name": "Cinelli P.", "AuthorID": "7003508597", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Division of Trauma Surgery, Center for Clinical Research, University Hospital Zurich"}, "55317043700": {"Name": "Weber F.", "AuthorID": "55317043700", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery, Oral Biotechnology and Bioengineering, University Hospital Zurich"}}}
