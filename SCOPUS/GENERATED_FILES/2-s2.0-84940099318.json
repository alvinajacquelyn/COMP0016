All Rights Reserved.Haemophilus influenzae is a significant causative agent of respiratory tract infections (RTI) worldwide. The development of a rapid H. influenzae diagnostic assay that would allow for the implementation of infection control measures and also improve antimicrobial stewardship for patients is required. A number of nucleic acid diagnostics approaches that detect H. influenzae in RTIs have been described in the literature; however, there are reported specificity and sensitivity limitations for these assays. In this study, a novel real-time PCR diagnostic assay targeting the smpB gene was designed to detect all serogroups of H. influenzae. The assay was validated using a panel of well-characterized Haemophilus spp. Subsequently, 44 Haemophilus clinical isolates were collected, and 36 isolates were identified as H. influenzae using a gold standard methodology that combined the results of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and a fucK diagnostic assay. Using the novel smpB diagnostic assay, 100% concordance was observed with the gold standard, demonstrating a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.26% to 100.00%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 63.06% to 100.00%) when used on clinical isolates. To demonstrate the clinical utility of the diagnostic assay presented, a panel of lower RTI samples (n=98) were blindly tested with the gold standard and smpB diagnostic assays. The results generated were concordant for 94/98 samples tested, demonstrating a sensitivity of 90.91% (95% CI, 78.33% to 97.47%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 93.40% to 100.00%) for the novel smpB assay when used directly on respiratory specimens.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacteriological Techniques", "Haemophilus Infections", "Haemophilus influenzae", "Humans", "Molecular Diagnostic Techniques", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940099318", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"38761911800": {"Name": "Reddington K.", "AuthorID": "38761911800", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Nucleic Acid Diagnostics Research Laboratory (NADRL), Microbiology, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland"}, "8619150400": {"Name": "Tuite N.", "AuthorID": "8619150400", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Nucleic Acid Diagnostics Research Laboratory (NADRL), Microbiology, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland"}, "25932118700": {"Name": "Coughlan H.", "AuthorID": "25932118700", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Nucleic Acid Diagnostics Research Laboratory (NADRL), Microbiology, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland"}, "7102200427": {"Name": "Barry T.", "AuthorID": "7102200427", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "Nucleic Acid Diagnostics Research Laboratory (NADRL), Microbiology, School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland"}, "55899490200": {"Name": "Schwenk S.", "AuthorID": "55899490200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56800313500": {"Name": "Platt G.", "AuthorID": "56800313500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56800744400": {"Name": "Davar D.", "AuthorID": "56800744400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55446344000": {"Name": "Personne Y.", "AuthorID": "55446344000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "6602325251": {"Name": "Enne V.I.", "AuthorID": "6602325251", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "35546887900": {"Name": "Gant V.", "AuthorID": "35546887900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
