Currently, little has been published concerning acceptable rates of reoperation following primary surgical management of orthopaedic trauma, particularly with reference to revalidation. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted of patients undergoing clearly defined reoperations following primary surgical management of trauma between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2011. A full case note review was undertaken to establish the demographics, clinical course and context of reoperation. A review of the imaging was performed to establish whether the procedure performed was in line with accepted trauma practice and whether the technical execution was acceptable. Results: A total of 3,688 patients underwent primary procedures within the time period studied while 70 (1.90%, 99% CI: 1.39-2.55) required an unplanned reoperation. Thirty-nine (56%) of these patients were male. The mean age of patients was 56 years (range: 18-98 years) and there was a median time to reoperation of 50 days (IQR: 13-154 days). Potentially avoidable reoperations occurred in 41 patients (58.6%, 99% CI: 43.2-72.6). This was largely due to technical errors (40 patients, 57.1%, 99% CI: 41.8-71.3), representing 1.11% (99% CI: 0.73-1.64) of the total trauma workload. Within RCS guidelines, 28-day reoperation rates for hip, wrist and ankle fractures were 1.4% (99% CI: 0.5-3.3), 3.5% (99% CI: 0.8%-12.1) and 1.86% (99% CI: 0.4-6.6) respectively. Conclusions: We present novel work that has established baseline reoperation rates for index procedures required for revalidation of orthopaedic surgeons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epidemiology of reoperation", "Orthopaedic trauma", "Reoperation", "Revalidation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Female", "Fractures, Bone", "Great Britain", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Orthopedic Procedures", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84917710695", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"53983824200": {"Name": "Barksfield R.C.", "AuthorID": "53983824200", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56022706800": {"Name": "Coomber R.", "AuthorID": "56022706800", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56446574900": {"Name": "Prinja A.", "AuthorID": "56446574900", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "40462656200": {"Name": "Wordsworth D.", "AuthorID": "40462656200", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57196874330": {"Name": "Lopez D.", "AuthorID": "57196874330", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55497941200": {"Name": "Burtt S.", "AuthorID": "55497941200", "AffiliationID": "60170309", "AffiliationName": "Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25223923300": {"Name": "Woolf K.", "AuthorID": "25223923300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
