The methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is produced in most cells through the folate cycle, but only a few cell types generate SAM from betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) via betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), which is expressed in the mouse ICM. Here, mean ICM cell numbers decreased from 18-19 in controls to 11-13 when the folate cycle was inhibited by the antifolate methotrexate and to 12-14 when BHMT expression was knocked down by antisense morpholinos. Inhibiting both pathways, however, much more severely affected ICM development (7-8 cells). Total SAM levels in mouse blastocysts decreased significantly only when both pathways were inhibited (from 3.1 to 1.6 pmol/100 blastocysts). DNA methylation, detected as 5-methylcytosine (5-MeC) immunofluorescence in isolated ICMs, was minimally affected by inhibition of either pathway alone but decreased by at least 45-55% when both BHMT and the folate cycle were inhibited simultaneously. Effects on cell numbers and 5-MeC levels in the ICM were completely rescued by methionine (immediate SAM precursor) or SAM. Both the folate cycle and betaine/BHMT appear to contribute to a methyl pool required for normal ICM development and establishing initial embryonic DNA methylation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Embryo", "Epigenetics", "Inner cell mass", "Methionine", "S-adenosylmethionine"], "IndexKeywords": ["5-Methylcytosine", "Animals", "Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic", "Betaine-Homocysteine S-Methyltransferase", "Blastocyst", "Cell Lineage", "Cells, Cultured", "DNA Methylation", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Female", "Fluorescent Antibody Technique", "Folic Acid", "Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic", "Liver", "Methotrexate", "Mice", "S-Adenosylmethionine", "snRNP Core Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937397985", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55721032200": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "55721032200", "AffiliationID": "60013175", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine"}, "37022716400": {"Name": "Lee M.B.", "AuthorID": "37022716400", "AffiliationID": "60013175", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine"}, "7006079143": {"Name": "Baltz J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006079143", "AffiliationID": "60013175", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Ottawa Faculty of Medicine"}, "54398334700": {"Name": "Denomme M.M.", "AuthorID": "54398334700", "AffiliationID": "60071028", "AffiliationName": "Children's Health Research Institute"}, "55937316800": {"Name": "White C.R.", "AuthorID": "55937316800", "AffiliationID": "60071028", "AffiliationName": "Children's Health Research Institute"}, "7202641499": {"Name": "Mann M.R.W.", "AuthorID": "7202641499", "AffiliationID": "60071028", "AffiliationName": "Children's Health Research Institute"}, "7401860629": {"Name": "Leung K.Y.", "AuthorID": "7401860629", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "35587452100": {"Name": "Greene N.D.E.", "AuthorID": "35587452100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "7006214695": {"Name": "Trasler J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006214695", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Human Genetics, Pediatrics, and Pharmacology and Therapeutics, McGill University"}}}
