We report the use of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motoneurons (MNs) to study the pathophysiology of ALS. We demonstrate that MNs derived from iPSCs obtained from healthy individuals or patients harbouring TARDBP or C9ORF72 ALS-causing mutations are able to develop appropriate physiological properties. However, patient iPSC-derived MNs, independent of genotype, display an initial hyperexcitability followed by progressive loss of action potential output and synaptic activity. This loss of functional output reflects a progressive decrease in voltage-activated Na + and K + currents, which occurs in the absenceof overt changes in cell viability. These data implicate early dysfunction or loss of ion channels as a convergent point that may contribute to the initiation of downstream degenerative pathways that ultimately lead to MN loss in ALS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis", "Cell Line", "Cell Survival", "DNA-Binding Proteins", "Female", "Genotype", "Humans", "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Male", "Motor Neurons", "Mutation", "Open Reading Frames", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Potassium", "Proteins", "Sodium"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923091694", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56521191500": {"Name": "Devlin A.C.", "AuthorID": "56521191500", "AffiliationID": "109483662", "AffiliationName": "Euan MacDonald Centre for Motor Neurone Disease Research"}, "36779519400": {"Name": "Foster J.D.", "AuthorID": "36779519400", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St. Andrews"}, "7005952003": {"Name": "Miles G.B.", "AuthorID": "7005952003", "AffiliationID": "109483662", "AffiliationName": "Euan MacDonald Centre for Motor Neurone Disease Research"}, "7003865887": {"Name": "Burr K.", "AuthorID": "7003865887", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroregeneration, Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "15922456600": {"Name": "Borooah S.", "AuthorID": "15922456600", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroregeneration, Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "56521257300": {"Name": "Cleary E.M.", "AuthorID": "56521257300", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroregeneration, Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "7004332041": {"Name": "Chandran S.", "AuthorID": "7004332041", "AffiliationID": "60014873, 60015879, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Neuroregeneration, Medical Research Council Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh"}, "34879604700": {"Name": "Geti I.", "AuthorID": "34879604700", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, Anne McLaren Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "22946015000": {"Name": "Vallier L.", "AuthorID": "22946015000", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, Anne McLaren Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "35370282000": {"Name": "Shaw C.E.", "AuthorID": "35370282000", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodegeneration Research, King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry"}}}
