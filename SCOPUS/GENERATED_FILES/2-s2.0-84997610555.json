Results of the experimental measurements, combined with a published water-to-octanol partition coefficient and published solubility data for sorbic dissolved in acetone, ethyl acetate and acetonitrile, were used to calculate Abraham model solute descriptors for the sorbic acid monomer. The calculated solute descriptors were found to describe the measured solubility and partition coefficient data to within 0.10 log units. The calculated solute descriptors can be used to predict sorbic acid solubilities at 298.15 K in additional organic solvents in which sorbic acid is expected to exist predominately in monomeric form.", "AuthorKeywords": ["solubility prediction", "solute descriptor", "solute transfer between phases", "Sorbic acid solubility"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acid solubility", "Descriptors", "Diisopropyl ether", "Methyl tert butyl ether", "Partition coefficient", "Solubility prediction", "Solute descriptors", "Solute transfer"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997610555", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55485915700": {"Name": "Barrera M.", "AuthorID": "55485915700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "56222214400": {"Name": "Hart E.", "AuthorID": "56222214400", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57190491364": {"Name": "Horton M.", "AuthorID": "57190491364", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57188536870": {"Name": "Higgins E.", "AuthorID": "57188536870", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57189996952": {"Name": "Cheeran S.", "AuthorID": "57189996952", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57190745325": {"Name": "Little G.", "AuthorID": "57190745325", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57190741130": {"Name": "Singleton H.", "AuthorID": "57190741130", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57192119349": {"Name": "Calhoon D.", "AuthorID": "57192119349", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57192109386": {"Name": "Gillispie K.", "AuthorID": "57192109386", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57192110700": {"Name": "Khalil F.", "AuthorID": "57192110700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "57192110969": {"Name": "Williams R.", "AuthorID": "57192110969", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "35496753700": {"Name": "Acree W.", "AuthorID": "35496753700", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}, "7202901240": {"Name": "Abraham M.", "AuthorID": "7202901240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
