CSF concentrations of total and phosphorylated tau, amyloid beta (A\u03b2)1-42, ratios of A\u03b242/40 and A\u03b242/38, soluble amyloid precursor protein \u03b1 and \u03b2, and neurofilament light chain protein were analyzed in relation to neuropsychological performance in 82 euthymic bipolar disorder patients and 71 healthy controls. Linear regression models were applied to account for performance in five cognitive domains using the CSF biomarkers. In patients, the CSF biomarkers explained a significant proportion of the variance (15-36%, p=.002 - <.0005) in all cognitive domains independently of age, medication, disease status, and bipolar subtype I or II. However, the CSF biomarkers specifically mirroring Alzheimertype brain changes, i.e., P-tau and A\u03b21-42, did not contribute significantly. In healthy controls, CSF biomarkers did not explain the variance in cognitive performance. Selected CSF biomarkers of neurodegenerative processes accounted for cognitive performance in persons with bipolar disorder, but not for healthy controls. Specifically, the ratios of A\u03b242/40 and A\u03b242/38 were consistently associated with altered cognitive performance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Bipolar Disorder", "Case-Control Studies", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957595866", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"22986387500": {"Name": "Rolstad S.", "AuthorID": "22986387500", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University"}, "55508135900": {"Name": "Jakobsson J.", "AuthorID": "55508135900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Institute for Neuroscience and Physiology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603374219": {"Name": "P\u00e5lsson E.", "AuthorID": "6603374219", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University"}, "7004259279": {"Name": "Land\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "7004259279", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "37020689800": {"Name": "Sellgren C.", "AuthorID": "37020689800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56116170200": {"Name": "Ekman C.", "AuthorID": "56116170200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
