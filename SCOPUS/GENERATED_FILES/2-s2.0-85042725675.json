LC integrity varies considerably across healthy older individuals, and is suggested to contribute to altered cognitive functions in aging. Here we test this hypothesis using an incidental memory task that is known to be susceptible to noradrenergic modulation. We used MRI neuromelanin (NM) imaging to assess LC structural integrity and pupillometry as a putative index of LC activation in both younger and older adults. We show that older adults with reduced structural LC integrity show poorer subsequent memory. This effect is more pronounced for emotionally negative events, in accord with a greater role for noradrenergic modulation in encoding salient or aversive events. In addition, we found that salient stimuli led to greater pupil diameters, consistent with increased LC activation during the encoding of such events. Our study presents novel evidence that a decrement in noradrenergic modulation impacts on specific components of cognition in healthy older adults. The findings provide a strong motivation for further investigation of the effects of altered LC integrity in pathological aging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Episodic memory", "Locus coeruleus", "Noradrenaline", "Pupillometry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Humans", "Locus Coeruleus", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Memory", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042725675", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35100283700": {"Name": "H\u00e4mmerer D.", "AuthorID": "35100283700", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "57194941394": {"Name": "Hopkins A.", "AuthorID": "57194941394", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "57200965957": {"Name": "Kosciessa J.", "AuthorID": "57200965957", "AffiliationID": "60026562", "AffiliationName": "Lifespan Psychology, Max Planck Institute for Human Development"}, "6701771740": {"Name": "D\u00fczel E.", "AuthorID": "6701771740", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"}, "9736087500": {"Name": "Callaghan M.F.", "AuthorID": "9736087500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "6602786222": {"Name": "Weiskopf N.", "AuthorID": "6602786222", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysics, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck University College London, Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "36840399500": {"Name": "Betts M.", "AuthorID": "36840399500", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"}, "6508147821": {"Name": "Cardenas-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "6508147821", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg"}, "6602680710": {"Name": "Kanowski M.", "AuthorID": "6602680710", "AffiliationID": "60072303, 60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital of Magdeburg, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "7006914663": {"Name": "Dayan P.", "AuthorID": "7006914663", "AffiliationID": "60084280", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby, Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
