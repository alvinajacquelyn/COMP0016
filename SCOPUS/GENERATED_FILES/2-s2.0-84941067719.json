The proposed model, in the linear approximation, can be compared to the well-known equilibrium equations of static linear elasticity. An appropriate kinetic energy is identified, and we present a dynamical model of rotational elasticity. The propagation of elastic waves in such a medium is studied and we find two classes of waves, transversal rotational waves and longitudinal rotational waves, both of which are solutions of the nonlinear partial differential equations. For certain parameter choices, the transversal wave velocity can be greater than the longitudinal wave velocity. Moreover, parameter ranges are identified where the model describes an auxetic material. However, in all cases the potential energy functional is positive definite. Finally, we couple the rotational waves to linear elastic waves to study the behaviour of the coupled system. We find wave-like solutions to the coupled equations and can visualise our results with the help of suitable figures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosserat continuum", "elastic waves", "exact solutions", "microrotations", "rotational waves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cosserat continuum", "Exact solution", "Linear approximations", "Longitudinal wave velocity", "microrotations", "Nonlinear partial differential equations", "Rotational waves", "Static linear elasticity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941067719", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"56247935800": {"Name": "B\u00f6hmer C.", "AuthorID": "56247935800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "37005969000": {"Name": "Tamanini N.", "AuthorID": "37005969000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
