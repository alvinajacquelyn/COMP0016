A data-set of proton-proton collisions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 4.6 fb-1 have been analysed, and new results of W boson + jet production, the ratio of W to Z boson + jet production, W boson + charm, and Z boson + b-jet production are described. Extensive comparisons from the latest theoretical calculations are also included.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATLAS", "CERN", "LHC", "QCD", "V+jets"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973117937", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"35227392300": {"Name": "Hesketh G.", "AuthorID": "35227392300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
