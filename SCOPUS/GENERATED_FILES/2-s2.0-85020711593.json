Although most researchers agree that mental effort is aversive and stems from limitations in our capacity to exercise cognitive control, it is unclear what gives rise to those limitations and why they result in an experience of control as costly. The presence of these control costs also raises further questions regarding how best to allocate mental effort to minimize those costs and maximize the attendant benefits. This review explores recent advances in computational modeling and empirical research aimed at addressing these questions at the level of psychological process and neural mechanism, examining both the limitations to mental effort exertion and how we manage those limited cognitive resources. We conclude by identifying remaining challenges for theoretical accounts of mental effort as well as possible applications of the available findings to understanding the causes of and potential solutions for apparent failures to exert the mental effort required of us.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive control", "Decision making", "Executive function", "Motivation", "Prefrontal cortex", "Reward"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cognition", "Decision Making", "Executive Function", "Humans", "Motivation", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reward"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020711593", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"25723894000": {"Name": "Shenhav A.", "AuthorID": "25723894000", "AffiliationID": "60011460", "AffiliationName": "Brown Institute for Brain Science, Brown University"}, "57195317708": {"Name": "Musslick S.", "AuthorID": "57195317708", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University"}, "54992680400": {"Name": "Cohen J.D.", "AuthorID": "54992680400", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Princeton University"}, "57217112896": {"Name": "Lieder F.", "AuthorID": "57217112896", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California"}, "23567903800": {"Name": "Kool W.", "AuthorID": "23567903800", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Harvard University"}, "35409148500": {"Name": "Griffiths T.L.", "AuthorID": "35409148500", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of California"}, "6602977616": {"Name": "Botvinick M.M.", "AuthorID": "6602977616", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}}}
