Methods: A total of 135 consecutive HP patients had CT parenchymal patterns evaluated quantitatively by both visual scoring and CALIPER. Results were evaluated against: forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and a composite physiological index (CPI) to identify which CT scoring method better correlated with functional indices. Results: CALIPER-derived scores of total interstitial lung disease extent correlated more strongly than visual scores: FVC (CALIPER R = 0.73, visual R = 0.51); DLCO (CALIPER R = 0.61, visual R = 0.48); and CPI (CALIPER R = 0\u00b770, visual R = 0\u00b755). The CT variable that correlated most strongly with restrictive functional indices was CALIPER pulmonary vessel volume (PVV): FVC R = 0.75, DLCO R = 0.68 and CPI R = 0.76. Ground-glass opacity quantified by CALIPER alone demonstrated strong associations with restrictive functional indices: CALIPER FVC R = 0.65; DLCO R = 0.59; CPI R = 0.64; and visual = not significant. Decreased attenuation lung quantified by CALIPER was a better morphological measure of obstructive lung disease than equivalent visual scores as judged by relationships with TLC (CALIPER R = 0.63 and visual R = 0.12). All results were maintained on multivariate analysis. Conclusion: CALIPER improved on visual scoring in HP as judged by restrictive and obstructive functional correlations. Decreased attenuation regions of the lung quantified by CALIPER demonstrated better linkages to obstructive lung physiology than visually quantified CT scores. A novel CALIPER variable, the PVV, demonstrated the strongest linkages with restrictive functional indices and could represent a new automated index of disease severity in HP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["air trapping", "hypersensitivity pneumonitis", "pulmonary vessel volume", "quantitative computer analysis", "visual computed tomography analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Airway Obstruction", "Airway Remodeling", "Alveolitis, Extrinsic Allergic", "Carbon Monoxide", "Female", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Lung", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022184817", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57200973324": {"Name": "Jacob J.", "AuthorID": "57200973324", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24069928400": {"Name": "Brun A.L.", "AuthorID": "24069928400", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102078625": {"Name": "Hansell D.M.", "AuthorID": "7102078625", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602803945": {"Name": "Bartholmai B.J.", "AuthorID": "6602803945", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiology, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "6701782045": {"Name": "Egashira R.", "AuthorID": "6701782045", "AffiliationID": "60165278, 60019983", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Faculty of Medicine, Saga University"}, "8596434600": {"Name": "Rajagopalan S.", "AuthorID": "8596434600", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "6603861094": {"Name": "Karwoski R.", "AuthorID": "6603861094", "AffiliationID": "60032610", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biomedical Engineering, Mayo Clinic Rochester"}, "24492319800": {"Name": "Kouranos V.", "AuthorID": "24492319800", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36614291500": {"Name": "Kokosi M.", "AuthorID": "36614291500", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201532967": {"Name": "Wells A.U.", "AuthorID": "57201532967", "AffiliationID": "60022023, 60009009", "AffiliationName": "Interstitial Lung Disease Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital, Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
