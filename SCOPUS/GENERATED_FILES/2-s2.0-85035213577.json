Dreyer\u2019s screenplay Medea to explore the concept of the unfilmed film. Beginning with von Trier\u2019s adoption of Dreyer\u2019s tuxedo, the article asks how the notions of auteurship and the archive itself produce the unfilmed film as \u2018unrealized\u2019, and probes the concept of the \u2018unfinished\u2019 film. Some examples of unfilmed films, and documentaries about them, are discussed as examples of archival practices in the mediation of unfinished, unrealized and unfilmed films, sometimes by directors themselves and sometimes by their successors. Dreyer\u2019s research materials and methodologies for his screenplay Medea, preserved in the Danish Film Institute, are discussed as an intertext to the later adaptation for Danish television by Lars von Trier.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archive", "Auteurship", "Carl Th.
