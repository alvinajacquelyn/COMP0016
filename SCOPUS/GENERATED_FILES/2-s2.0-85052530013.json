At certain shear values, resonances emerge in which the effects on flow and patch shape are enlarged by an order of magnitude. Fast evolution then occurs: this leads to fully nonlinear unsteady interaction, after some delay, combining with finite-time break-ups to form a distinct path into transition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flexibility", "Floes", "Shear"], "IndexKeywords": ["Finite time", "Flexibility", "Floes", "Fully nonlinear", "On flow", "Shear values", "Unsteady interaction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052530013", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55248576300": {"Name": "Smith F.", "AuthorID": "55248576300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
