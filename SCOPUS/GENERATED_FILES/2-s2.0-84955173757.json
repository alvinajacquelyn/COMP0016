Benth. & Hook. f. ex Franch. & Sav. (RAD) and Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk. (RSD)] using chlorogenic acid as a marker substance. Ex vivo everted intestinal sac and in situ single pass perfusion methods using rats were employed to investigate the effects of two TCM botanical drugs extracts on the intestinal absorption of chlorogenic acid. Both the extracts of RAD and RSD showed synergistic properties on the intestinal absorption of chlorogenic acid. The verapamil (a P-gp inhibitor) and intestinal dysbacteriosis model induced by norfloxacin increased the Papp and Ka of intestinal absorption of chlorogenic acid. These synergistic effects on intestinal absorption in a rat model can be correlated with the inhibition of P-gp and regulation of gut microbiota. This experimental approach has helped to better understand changes in the absorption of chlorogenic acid under different conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angelica dahurica", "chlorogenic acid", "everted rat gut sac", "intestinal absorption", "Saposhnikovia divaricata", "single-pass intestinal perfusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angelica", "Animals", "Apiaceae", "Chlorogenic Acid", "Drug Synergism", "Drugs, Chinese Herbal", "Intestinal Absorption", "Intestines", "Male", "P-Glycoprotein", "Plant Extracts", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Verapamil"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955173757", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57195416478": {"Name": "Zhai L.", "AuthorID": "57195416478", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, Research Cluster Biodiversity and Medicines, UCL School of Pharmacy, University of London"}, "55366574900": {"Name": "Shi J.", "AuthorID": "55366574900", "AffiliationID": "60073525", "AffiliationName": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"}, "57193069546": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "57193069546", "AffiliationID": "60073525", "AffiliationName": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"}, "56992721200": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56992721200", "AffiliationID": "60073525", "AffiliationName": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"}, "56992031700": {"Name": "Deng W.", "AuthorID": "56992031700", "AffiliationID": "60073525", "AffiliationName": "School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University"}, "16156235300": {"Name": "Heinrich M.", "AuthorID": "16156235300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, Research Cluster Biodiversity and Medicines, UCL School of Pharmacy, University of London"}}}
