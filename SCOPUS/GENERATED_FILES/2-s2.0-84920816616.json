KGaA.The parent core structure of mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) is 4-deoxygadusol, which, in cyanobacteria, is derived from conversion of the pentose phosphate pathway intermediate sedoheptulose 7-phosphate by the enzymes 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone synthase (EVS) and O-methyltransferase (OMT). Yet, deletion of the EVS gene from Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413 was shown to have little effect on MAA production, thus suggesting that its biosynthesis is not exclusive to the pentose phosphate pathway. Herein, we report how, using pathway-specific inhibitors, we demonstrated unequivocally that MAA biosynthesis occurs also via the shikimate pathway. In addition, complete in-frame gene deletion of the OMT gene from A. variabilis ATCC 29413 reveals that, although biochemically distinct, the pentose phosphate and shikimate pathways are inextricably linked to MAA biosynthesis in this cyanobacterium. Furthermore, proteomic data reveal that the shikimate pathway is the predominate route for UV-induced MAA biosynthesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Microbiology", "Mycosporine-like amino acids", "Natural products", "Pentose phosphate pathway", "Shikimate pathway"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acids", "Anabaena variabilis", "Bacterial Proteins", "Gene Deletion", "Glycine", "Metabolic Networks and Pathways", "Methyltransferases", "Pentose Phosphate Pathway", "Phosphorus-Oxygen Lyases", "Proteomics", "Shikimic Acid", "Ultraviolet Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920816616", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56478309700": {"Name": "Pope M.A.", "AuthorID": "56478309700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Long Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "36963183600": {"Name": "Spence E.", "AuthorID": "36963183600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Long Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "56479184800": {"Name": "Seralvo V.", "AuthorID": "56479184800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Long Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "55621567300": {"Name": "Gacesa R.", "AuthorID": "55621567300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Long Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "7004360219": {"Name": "Dunlap W.C.", "AuthorID": "7004360219", "AffiliationID": "60014975", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Marine Microbiology and Genetics, Australian Institute of Marine Science"}, "57203079576": {"Name": "Long P.F.", "AuthorID": "57203079576", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "9740589700": {"Name": "Heidelberger S.", "AuthorID": "9740589700", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "14017092100": {"Name": "Weston A.J.", "AuthorID": "14017092100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London Proteomics Facility, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "7004077354": {"Name": "Shick J.M.", "AuthorID": "7004077354", "AffiliationID": "60008279", "AffiliationName": "School of Marine Sciences, University of Maine"}}}
