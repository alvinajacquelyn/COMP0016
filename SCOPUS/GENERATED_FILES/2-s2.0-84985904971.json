Yet the neural mechanism responsible for such adaptive learning has remained unclear. To fill this gap, we investigated a biophysically inspired, metaplastic synaptic model within the context of a well-studied decisionmaking network, in which synapses can change their rate of plasticity in addition to their efficacy according to a reward-based learning rule. We found that our model, which assumes that synaptic plasticity is guided by a novel surprise detection system, captures a wide range of key experimental findings and performs as well as a Bayes optimal model, with remarkably little parameter tuning. Our results further demonstrate the computational power of synaptic plasticity, and provide insights into the circuit-level computation which underlies adaptive decision-making.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Animals", "Biophysical Phenomena", "Decision Making", "Humans", "Learning", "Neural Networks (Computer)", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Uncertainty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985904971", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56617808600": {"Name": "Iigaya K.", "AuthorID": "56617808600", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Columbia University"}}}
