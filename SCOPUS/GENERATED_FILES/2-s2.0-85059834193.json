There is scarce evidence for pulmonary artery denervation (PADN) as a potential treatment for chronic postcapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH). We aimed to perform a proof-of-concept of PADN in a translational model of chronic PH. Nineteen pigs with chronic postcapillary PH (secondary to pulmonary vein banding) were randomized to surgical-PADN (using bipolar radiofrequency clamps) or sham procedure. Additionally, 6 healthy animals underwent percutaneous-PADN to compare the pulmonary artery (PA) lesion generated with both approaches. In the surgical-PADN arm, hemodynamic evaluation and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) were performed at baseline and at 2 and 3-month follow-up. Histological assessment was carried out at the completion of the protocol. Eighteen pigs (6 following surgical-PADN, 6 sham and 6 percutaneous-PADN) completed the protocol. A complete transmural PA lesion was demonstrated using surgical clamps, whereas only focal damage to adventitial fibers was observed after percutaneous-PADN. In the surgical-PADN arm, the hemodynamic profile did not significantly differ between groups neither at baseline [mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) median values of 32.0 vs. 27.5 mmHg, P = 0.394 and indexed pulmonary vascular resistance (iPVR) 5.9 vs. 4.7 WU m 2 , P = 0.394 for PADN/sham groups, respectively] nor at any follow-up (mPAP of 35.0 vs. 35.0 mmHg, P = 0.236 and iPVR of 8.3 vs. 6.7 WU m 2 , P = 0.477 at third month in PADN/sham groups, respectively). Surgical-PADN was not associated with any benefit in RV anatomy or function on CMR/histology. In a large-animal model of chronic postcapillary PH, transmural PADN with surgical clamps was associated with a neutral pulmonary hemodynamic effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Denervation", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Pulmonary hypertension", "Treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Denervation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Pulmonary Artery", "Random Allocation", "Swine", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059834193", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56189452600": {"Name": "Garcia-Lunar I.", "AuthorID": "56189452600", "AffiliationID": "60028356", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Quir\u00f3nsalud Madrid, UEM"}, "8569882900": {"Name": "Pereda D.", "AuthorID": "8569882900", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Clinic Cardiovascular Institute, IDIBAPS, Hospital Cl\u00ednic"}, "57196603256": {"Name": "Santiago E.", "AuthorID": "57196603256", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Clinic Cardiovascular Institute, IDIBAPS, Hospital Cl\u00ednic"}, "57204759373": {"Name": "Nuche J.", "AuthorID": "57204759373", "AffiliationID": "60004024", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Doce de Octubre"}, "57189994928": {"Name": "Sierra F.", "AuthorID": "57189994928", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC)"}, "57205394367": {"Name": "Gal\u00e1n C.", "AuthorID": "57205394367", "AffiliationID": "118354380", "AffiliationName": "CIBER de Enfermedades Cardiovasculares (CIBERCV)"}, "7202675508": {"Name": "Fuster V.", "AuthorID": "7202675508", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "Zena and Michael A.
