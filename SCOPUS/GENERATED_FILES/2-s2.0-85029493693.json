Despite extensive investigation, researchers have yet to identify qualitative changes in face processing during development that can account for the observed improvements on laboratory tests. The current study constituted the first detailed characterization of face processing strategies in a large group of typically developing children and adults (N = 200) using a novel adaptation of the Bubbles reverse correlation technique (Gosselin and Schyns, 2001). Resultant classification images reveal a compelling age-related shift in strategic information use during participants' judgments of face identity. This shift suggests a move from an early reliance upon high spatial frequency details around the mouth, eye-brow and jaw-line in young children (\u223c8 years) to an increasingly more interlinked approach, focused upon the eye region and the center of the face in older children (\u223c11 years) and adults. Moreover, we reveal that the early versus late phases of this developmental trajectory correspond with the profiles of information use observed in weak versus strong adult face processors. Together, these results provide intriguing new evidence for an important functional role for strategic information use in the development of face expertise.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Development", "Face perception", "Identity", "Recognition memory", "Reverse correlation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Child Development", "Facial Recognition", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Social Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029493693", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"16028304500": {"Name": "Ewing L.", "AuthorID": "16028304500", "AffiliationID": "60000112, 60187518, 60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East Anglia, ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Western Australia"}, "7003649617": {"Name": "Karmiloff-Smith A.", "AuthorID": "7003649617", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57208382806": {"Name": "Smith M.L.", "AuthorID": "57208382806", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6602319057": {"Name": "Farran E.K.", "AuthorID": "6602319057", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
