All rights reserved.Gene deletion of the voltage-gated calciumchannel auxiliary subunit \u03b12\u03b4-1 has been shown previously to have a cardiovascular phenotype, and a reduction in mechano-and cold sensitivity, coupled with delayed development of neuropathic allodynia. We have also previously shown that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron calcium channel currents were significantly reduced in \u03b12\u03b4-1 knockout mice. To extend our findings in these sensory neurons, we have examined here the properties of action potentials (APs) in DRG neurons from \u03b12\u03b4-1 knockout mice in comparison to their wild-type (WT) littermates, in order to dissect how the calcium channels that are affected by \u03b12\u03b4-1 knockout are involved in setting the duration of individual APs and their firing frequency. Our main findings are that there is reduced Ca2+ entry on single AP stimulation, particularly in the axon proximal segment, reduced AP duration and reduced firing frequency to a 400 ms stimulation in \u03b12\u03b4-1 knockout neurons, consistent with the expected role of voltage-gated calcium channels in these events. Furthermore, lower intracellular Ca2+ buffering also resulted in reduced AP duration, and a lower frequency of AP firing in WT neurons, mimicking the effect of \u03b12\u03b4-1 knockout. By contrast, we did not obtain any consistent evidence for the involvement of Ca2+-activation of large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) and small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels in these events. In conclusion, the reduced Ca2+ elevation as a result of single AP stimulation is likely to result from the reduced duration of the AP in \u03b12\u03b4-1 knockout sensory neurons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Action potential", "Auxiliary subunit", "Calcium channel", "Calcium transient", "Excitability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Calcium Channels", "Female", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Male", "Mice, Knockout", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977567838", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"6507650153": {"Name": "Margas W.", "AuthorID": "6507650153", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "8506464000": {"Name": "Ferron L.", "AuthorID": "8506464000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "15124732500": {"Name": "Nieto-Rostro M.", "AuthorID": "15124732500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "24498942300": {"Name": "Dolphin A.", "AuthorID": "24498942300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "36047183500": {"Name": "Schwartz A.", "AuthorID": "36047183500", "AffiliationID": "60017412, 60025152", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, University of Cincinnati"}}}
