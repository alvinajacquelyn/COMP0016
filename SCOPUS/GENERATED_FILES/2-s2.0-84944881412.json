Hyperphosphorylated tau is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite extensive research, the role of GSK3B in AD pathogenesis is not fully understood.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate possible associations between gene variants of GSK3B and risk of AD.METHODS: Twelve GSK3B tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), together with the previously AD-associated rs334558, were analyzed in 583 AD patients and 673 controls. Analyses on single marker and haplotype levels were done to relate to risk of AD, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels of total tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau181), and amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b242).RESULTS: After correction for multiple testing, we found a number of associations of gene variants with CSF biomarker levels and cognitive function in the AD patients. Firstly, rs334558 was associated with elevated T-tau levels (pc = 0.04). Next, rs1154597 showed association with reduced A\u03b242 levels (pc = 0.007). Lastly, rs3107669 was associated with lower MMSE scores (pc = 0.03). In addition, one more SNP was nominally significantly associated with reduced A\u03b242 levels and another was associated with reduced MMSE.CONCLUSION: We found GSK3B gene variants associated with cognitive function and CSF biomarkers T-tau and A\u03b242. To our knowledge, this is the first time GSK3B has been associated with cognitive function or CSF biomarkers reflecting neuronal degeneration (T-tau) and brain amyloid load (A\u03b242). The regulation of GSK3B needs to be investigated further, to fully understand how these GSK3B gene variants are involved in AD pathogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "amyloid-\u03b2 peptide", "association", "biomarker", "cerebrospinal fluid", "gene", "glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta", "Mini-Mental State Examination", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genotype", "Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Status Schedule", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944881412", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7006399137": {"Name": "Kettunen P.", "AuthorID": "7006399137", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "56861739300": {"Name": "Larsson S.", "AuthorID": "56861739300", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "56465469900": {"Name": "Holmgren S.", "AuthorID": "56465469900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "36572317200": {"Name": "Olsson S.", "AuthorID": "36572317200", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "7003614157": {"Name": "Minthon L.", "AuthorID": "7003614157", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "35479725000": {"Name": "Nilsson S.", "AuthorID": "35479725000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}, "22938738100": {"Name": "Sj\u00f6lander A.", "AuthorID": "22938738100", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg"}}}
