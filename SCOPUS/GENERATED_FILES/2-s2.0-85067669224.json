This article considers this uncertainty, concluding that the best understanding of Waldron\u2019s argument is that hate speech tends to cause harm - a weak form of the consequentialist case for its proscription. His argument is not advanced by his apparent reliance on speech-act theory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Causing or constituting harm", "Speech-act theory", "The harm in hate speech", "Waldron"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067669224", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"]], "AuthorData": {"33067539700": {"Name": "Barendt E.", "AuthorID": "33067539700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
