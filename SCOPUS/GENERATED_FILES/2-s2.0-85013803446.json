P(3HO) is a unique member of the family of natural polyhydroxyalkanoate biopolymers. The P(3HO)/n-BG composite films were fabricated using the solvent casting method. Microstructural studies revealed n-BG particles both embedded in the matrix and deposited on the surface, which introduced nanotopography and increased its hydrophilicity. The composite exhibited an increase in the Young\u2019s modulus when compared to the control, yet maintained flexible elastomeric properties. These changes in the surface topography and chemistry of the composite system led to an increase of protein adsorption and cytocompatibility for the seeded human keratinocyte cell line. The results from this study demonstrated that the fabricated P(3HO)/n-BG composite system is a promising novel matrix material with potential applications in skin tissue engineering and wound healing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioactive glass", "composites", "poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate)", "skin tissue engineering", "wound healing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Elastomeric properties", "Human keratinocyte", "poly(3-hydroxyoctanoate)", "Polyhydroxyalkanoate biopolymers", "Protein adsorption", "Skin tissue engineering", "Solvent casting method", "Wound healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013803446", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"]], "AuthorData": {"24329875000": {"Name": "Rai R.", "AuthorID": "24329875000", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}, "55915285600": {"Name": "Keshavarz T.", "AuthorID": "55915285600", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}, "57213789119": {"Name": "Roy I.", "AuthorID": "57213789119", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}, "6602398839": {"Name": "Roether J.A.", "AuthorID": "6602398839", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg"}, "55937239600": {"Name": "Boccaccini A.R.", "AuthorID": "55937239600", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Erlangen\u2013Nuremberg"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "WCU Research Centre of Nanobiomedical Science, Dankook University"}, "6603066611": {"Name": "Mordan N.", "AuthorID": "6603066611", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "56216499500": {"Name": "Salih V.", "AuthorID": "56216499500", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "6603628935": {"Name": "Locke I.C.", "AuthorID": "6603628935", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}, "6603899261": {"Name": "Gordge M.P.", "AuthorID": "6603899261", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Westminster"}, "57193422941": {"Name": "McCormick A.", "AuthorID": "57193422941", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "Hemophilia Reference Centre, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "23486085600": {"Name": "Mohn D.", "AuthorID": "23486085600", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology, and Cardiology, University of Zurich Center of Dental Medicine"}, "56216332000": {"Name": "Stark W.J.", "AuthorID": "56216332000", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, ETH Zurich"}}}
