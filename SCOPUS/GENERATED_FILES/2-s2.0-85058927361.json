It has been successfully employed to describe the approximate integer quantization of the transverse conductance of a system described by a short-range, bounded, and spectrally gapped Hamiltonian on a lattice on a finite two-dimensional torus and to describe the invariant of the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model even with disorder. This paper shows the constancy in time of the Bott index and the Chern number related to the time-evolved Fermi projection of a system described by a short-range, bounded, and time-dependent Hamiltonian that is initially gapped. The general situation of a ramp of a time-dependent perturbation is considered, a section is dedicated to time-periodic perturbations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["General situation", "Integer quantization", "Periodic perturbation", "Time dependent", "Time-dependent Hamiltonians", "Time-dependent perturbation", "Topological systems", "Unitary matrix"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058927361", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56241953700": {"Name": "Toniolo D.", "AuthorID": "56241953700", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Department Mathematik, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}}}
