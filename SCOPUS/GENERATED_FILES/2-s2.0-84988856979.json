In addition to a review of the most scientifically and clinically relevant findings, technical and methodological background information is provided to help the reader better understand the data acquisition process. We show how both approaches may play a role in the presurgical evaluation of patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and provide opportunities for new insights into the neuropathological processes that underlie both focal and generalized epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain activity mapping", "Cognitive mapping", "EEG", "EEGcorrelated fMRI", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "fMRI", "Focal epilepsy", "Functional magnetic resonance imaging", "Functional mapping", "Generalized epilepsy", "Ictal", "Imaging", "Interictal", "Language lateralization", "Memory mapping", "Multi-modal imaging", "Presurgical evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988856979", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"25640387400": {"Name": "Thornton R.", "AuthorID": "25640387400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57191333904": {"Name": "van Graan L.", "AuthorID": "57191333904", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36025755800": {"Name": "Powell R.", "AuthorID": "36025755800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005729118": {"Name": "Lemieux L.", "AuthorID": "7005729118", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
