KGaA, WeinheimDefects are detrimental for optoelectronics devices, such as stacking faults can form carrier-transportation barriers, and foreign impurities (Au) with deep-energy levels can form carrier traps and nonradiative recombination centers. Here, self-catalyzed p-type GaAs nanowires (NWs) with a pure zinc blende (ZB) structure are first developed, and then a photodetector made from these NWs is fabricated. Due to the absence of stacking faults and suppression of large amount of defects with deep energy levels, the photodetector exhibits room-temperature high photoresponsivity of 1.45 \u00d7 105 A W\u22121 and excellent specific detectivity (D*) up to 1.48 \u00d7 1014 Jones for a low-intensity light signal of wavelength 632.8 nm, which outperforms previously reported NW-based photodetectors. These results demonstrate these self-catalyzed pure-ZB GaAs NWs to be promising candidates for optoelectronics applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GaAs nanowires", "phase-pure crystal structures", "photodetectors", "photoresponsivity", "self-catalyzed growth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier transportation", "Gaas nanowires", "Nonradiative recombination centers", "Optoelectronics devices", "Phase pure", "Photoresponsivity", "Self-catalyzed growth", "Specific detectivity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044783860", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57206713195": {"Name": "Ali H.", "AuthorID": "57206713195", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55714022300": {"Name": "Tang J.", "AuthorID": "55714022300", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57205722011": {"Name": "Peng K.", "AuthorID": "57205722011", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56996472300": {"Name": "Sun S.", "AuthorID": "56996472300", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56174871200": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "56174871200", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56996687000": {"Name": "Song F.", "AuthorID": "56996687000", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56996346200": {"Name": "Wu S.", "AuthorID": "56996346200", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56597448000": {"Name": "Qian C.", "AuthorID": "56597448000", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55619295117": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "55619295117", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7103368270": {"Name": "Zuo Z.", "AuthorID": "7103368270", "AffiliationID": "60012820, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Beijing National Laboratory for Condensed Matter Physics, Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7102766964": {"Name": "Jin K.J.", "AuthorID": "7102766964", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "School of Physical Sciences, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7405298486": {"Name": "Xu X.", "AuthorID": "7405298486", "AffiliationID": "60027363, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "CAS Center for Excellence in Topological Quantum Computation, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "37017831000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "37017831000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56046529000": {"Name": "Falak A.", "AuthorID": "56046529000", "AffiliationID": "60053707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of the Punjab"}, "56946096400": {"Name": "Sanchez A.M.", "AuthorID": "56946096400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Warwick"}}}
