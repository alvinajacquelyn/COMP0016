The paper also discusses limitations of the research evidence and implications for future intervention and evaluation design. Thirteen programmes met the criteria in the review period 2005\u20132012 but only four had been evaluated using randomized control trials or with independent measures from mothers and fathers. Analysis of these four programmes shows modest evidence of reduced couple-conflict, improved coparenting and some evidence of improved child outcomes. Key issues raised are the need for improving the quantity and quality of demographic data about fathers; the importance of incorporating analysis by gender of parent into evaluation design and the value of developing and routinely using father-related indicators to measure programme impact on men's parenting, fathering and co-parental relationships.", "AuthorKeywords": ["divorce", "evaluation", "fathers", "gender", "parenting programmes", "separation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978402479", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57189165363": {"Name": "O'Brien M.", "AuthorID": "57189165363", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Institute, University College London, Institute of Education"}, "55616338300": {"Name": "Philip G.", "AuthorID": "55616338300", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research on Children and Families, University of East Anglia"}}}
