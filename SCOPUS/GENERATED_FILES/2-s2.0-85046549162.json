Children viewed a live staged event involving 2 male actors, and were asked to identify the perpetrators from 2 separate lineups (one perpetrator-present lineup and one perpetrator-absent lineup). Half the children took part in lineups adapted by a registered intermediary (an impartial, trained professional who facilitates understanding and communication between vulnerable witnesses and members of the justice system), and half took part in \u201cbest-practice\u201d lineups, according to the current guidance for eyewitness identification in England and Wales. Children receiving assistance from a registered intermediary (relative to children who received best-practice lineups) were more accurate in their identifications for perpetrator-present lineups, and there was some evidence that they were also more accurate for perpetrator-absent lineups. This provides the first empirical evidence for the effectiveness of registered intermediary support during identification lineups.", "AuthorKeywords": ["child witnesses", "identification", "intermediaries"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046549162", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"8576959600": {"Name": "Wilcock R.", "AuthorID": "8576959600", "AffiliationID": "60003310", "AffiliationName": "University of Winchester"}, "23766915000": {"Name": "Crane L.", "AuthorID": "23766915000", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "57194208264": {"Name": "Hobson Z.", "AuthorID": "57194208264", "AffiliationID": "120331078", "AffiliationName": "Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime"}, "16245596300": {"Name": "Nash G.", "AuthorID": "16245596300", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City, University of London"}, "56079041300": {"Name": "Kirke-Smith M.", "AuthorID": "56079041300", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City, University of London"}, "7102224928": {"Name": "Henry L.A.", "AuthorID": "7102224928", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City, University of London"}}}
