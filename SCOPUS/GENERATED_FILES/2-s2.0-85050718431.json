In 2015, PEPFAR (the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) with private-sector partners launched the DREAMS Partnership, an ambitious package of interventions in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. DREAMS aims to reduce HIV incidence by 40% among AGYW over two years by addressing multiple causes of AGYW vulnerability. This protocol outlines an impact evaluation of DREAMS in four settings. Methods: To achieve an impact evaluation that is credible and timely, we describe a mix of methods that build on longitudinal data available in existing surveillance sites prior to DREAMS roll-out. In three long-running surveillance sites (in rural and urban Kenya and rural South Africa), the evaluation will measure: (1) population-level changes over time in HIV incidence and socio-economic, behavioural and health outcomes among AGYW and young men (before, during, after DREAMS); and (2) causal pathways linking uptake of DREAMS interventions to 'mediators' of change such as empowerment, through to behavioural and health outcomes, using nested cohort studies with samples of \u223c 1000-1500 AGYW selected randomly from the general population and followed for two years. In Zimbabwe, where DREAMS includes an offer of pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis (PrEP), cohorts of young women who sell sex will be followed for two years to measure the impact of 'DREAMS+PrEP' on HIV incidence among young women at highest risk of HIV. In all four settings, process evaluation and qualitative studies will monitor the delivery and context of DREAMS implementation. The primary evaluation outcome is HIV incidence, and secondary outcomes include indicators of sexual behavior change, and social and biological protection. Discussion: DREAMS is, to date, the most ambitious effort to scale-up combinations or 'packages' of multi-sectoral interventions for HIV prevention. Evidence of its effectiveness in reducing HIV incidence among AGYW, and demonstrating which aspects of the lives of AGYW were changed, will offer valuable lessons for replication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescent health", "Complex intervention", "Gender equity", "HIV prevention", "Impact evaluation", "Kenya", "South Africa", "Zimbabwe"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Epidemiologic Research Design", "Female", "HIV", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Kenya", "Longitudinal Studies", "Population Surveillance", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Pregnancy", "Program Evaluation", "Prospective Studies", "Public-Private Sector Partnerships", "Qualitative Research", "Sexual Behavior", "South Africa", "Young Adult", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050718431", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"23396079800": {"Name": "Birdthistle I.", "AuthorID": "23396079800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "56014517500": {"Name": "Schaffnit S.B.", "AuthorID": "56014517500", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "University of California at Santa Barbara"}, "55028841900": {"Name": "Gourlay A.", "AuthorID": "55028841900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7004976105": {"Name": "Glynn J.R.", "AuthorID": "7004976105", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7005201405": {"Name": "Floyd S.", "AuthorID": "7005201405", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "54885269300": {"Name": "Kwaro D.", "AuthorID": "54885269300", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Research, Kenyan Medical Research Institute"}, "57195136082": {"Name": "Ondeng'E K.", "AuthorID": "57195136082", "AffiliationID": "60070343", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health Research, Kenyan Medical Research Institute"}, "7006172333": {"Name": "Shahmanesh M.", "AuthorID": "7006172333", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "53866161900": {"Name": "Chimbindi N.", "AuthorID": "53866161900", "AffiliationID": "60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute"}, "24074972100": {"Name": "Ziraba A.", "AuthorID": "24074972100", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center"}, "6506010522": {"Name": "Kabiru C.W.", "AuthorID": "6506010522", "AffiliationID": "60070562", "AffiliationName": "African Population and Health Research Center"}, "7005396053": {"Name": "Phillips-Howard P.", "AuthorID": "7005396053", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "56432392100": {"Name": "Cowan F.M.", "AuthorID": "56432392100", "AffiliationID": "60138807", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Research (CeSHHAR)"}, "57200551734": {"Name": "Chiyaka T.", "AuthorID": "57200551734", "AffiliationID": "60138807", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS Research (CeSHHAR)"}, "7102195044": {"Name": "Hargreaves J.R.", "AuthorID": "7102195044", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "37112124700": {"Name": "Hensen B.", "AuthorID": "37112124700", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Infectious and Tropical Diseases, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
