Most of the studies investigating molecular changes in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have only examined a limited number of molecules and genes. Consequently, biomarkers associated with TRD are still lacking. Objectives: This study aimed to use recently advanced high-throughput proteomic platforms to identify peripheral biomarkers of TRD defined by two staging models, the Thase and Rush staging model (TRM) and the Maudsley Staging Model (MSM). Methods: Serum collected from an inpatient cohort of 65 individuals suffering from MDD was analysed using two different mass spectrometric-based platforms, label-free liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MSE) and selective reaction monitoring (SRM), as well as a multiplex bead based assay. Results: In the LC-MSE analysis, proteins involved in the acute phase response and complement activation and coagulation were significantly different between the staging groups in both models. In the multiplex bead-based assay analysis TNF-\u03b1 levels (log(odds) = \u22124.95, p = 0.045) were significantly different in the TRM comparison. Using SRM, significant changes of three apolipoproteins A\u2013I (\u03b2 = 0.029, p = 0.035), M (\u03b2 = \u22120.017, p = 0.009) and F (\u03b2 = \u22120.031, p = 0.024) were associated with the TRM but not the MSM. Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that proteins, which are involved in immune and complement activation, may represent potential biomarkers that could be used by clinicians to identify high-risk patients. Nevertheless, given that the molecular changes between the staging groups were subtle, the results need to be interpreted cautiously.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mass spectrometry", "Serum", "Staging", "Treatment resistant depression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antidepressive Agents", "Biomarkers", "Blood Coagulation", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Cohort Studies", "Complement Activation", "Cytokines", "Depressive Disorder, Major", "Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant", "DNA Mismatch Repair", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Mass Spectrometry", "Middle Aged", "Proteomics", "Severity of Illness Index", "Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975229298", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55341940400": {"Name": "Ruland T.", "AuthorID": "55341940400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "56344342200": {"Name": "Grosse L.", "AuthorID": "56344342200", "AffiliationID": "116122551", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Morphological Solutions"}, "7003287651": {"Name": "Rothermundt M.", "AuthorID": "7003287651", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Mood and Anxiety Disorders Research Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Muenster"}, "56247579900": {"Name": "Arolt V.", "AuthorID": "56247579900", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "Mood and Anxiety Disorders Research Unit, Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Muenster"}, "56346793500": {"Name": "Chan M.K.", "AuthorID": "56346793500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "57205490474": {"Name": "Stocki P.", "AuthorID": "57205490474", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "57217846554": {"Name": "Cooper J.D.", "AuthorID": "57217846554", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "55605080600": {"Name": "Bahn S.", "AuthorID": "55605080600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}}}
