The as-prepared nano-powders with ca. 25 at% Nb5+ (<6 nm diameter) were used as possible anodes for lithium-ion batteries without any further heat-treatment. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge cycling tests were performed in the range of 1.2 to 3.0 V vs. Li/Li+. The Nb-doped TiO2 samples showed superior capacity retention at high current rates compared to the corresponding undoped nano-TiO2. The superior performance of the doped samples (at specific currents up to 15 A g-1) was attributed to higher electronic conductivity and a greater charge storage contribution from surface effects like pseudocapacitance (Faradaic processes) as well as Helmholtz double layer charge storage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Capacity retention", "Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "Electronic conductivity", "Galvanostatic charge/discharge", "Helmholtz double layers", "High current rates", "Pseudocapacitance", "Supercritical water flow"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947077310", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55226279200": {"Name": "L\u00fcbke M.", "AuthorID": "55226279200", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A STAR)"}, "56959691700": {"Name": "Shin J.", "AuthorID": "56959691700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55243347800": {"Name": "Marchand P.", "AuthorID": "55243347800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratories, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55820974500": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "55820974500", "AffiliationID": "60030743, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A STAR)"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
