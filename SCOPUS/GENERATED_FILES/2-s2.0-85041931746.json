Furthermore, it is now evident that mechanical cues alongside biochemical signals contribute to critical steps of cancer initiation, progression, and spread. Despite its importance, it is very challenging to study mechanics of different steps of metastasis in the clinic or even in animal models. While considerable progress has been made in developing advanced in vitro models for studying genetic and biological aspects of cancer, less attention has been paid to models that can capture both biological and mechanical factors realistically. This is mainly due to lack of appropriate models and measurement tools. After introducing the central role of mechanics in cancer metastasis, we provide an outlook on the emergence of novel in vitro assays and their combination with advanced measurement technologies to probe and recapitulate mechanics in conditions more relevant to the metastatic disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D microenvironment", "biomaterials", "cancer mechanobiology", "extravasation", "invasive tumour", "microfluidics", "traction forces"], "IndexKeywords": ["Appropriate models", "Extracellular environments", "extravasation", "Measurement technologies", "Mechanical factors", "Mechano-biology", "Microenvironments", "Traction forces"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041931746", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"21734853900": {"Name": "Malandrino A.", "AuthorID": "21734853900", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "26643635500": {"Name": "Kamm R.", "AuthorID": "26643635500", "AffiliationID": "60104011", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia"}, "24554512000": {"Name": "Moeendarbary E.", "AuthorID": "24554512000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
