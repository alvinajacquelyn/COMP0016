In many of these countries, this is the most common cancer in women. The survivals of the women with gynecologic cancers are hampered by the paucity of prevention, screening, treatment facilities and gynecologic oncology providers. Increasing efforts dedicated to improving education and research in these countries have been provided by international organizations. We describe here the existing educational and research programs that are offered by major international organizations, the barriers and opportunities provided by these collaborations and hope to improve the outcomes of cervical cancer through these efforts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education", "Low- and middle-income countries", "Opportunities", "Research", "Scholarships"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048455446", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"35725062200": {"Name": "Chuang L.", "AuthorID": "35725062200", "AffiliationID": "120828286", "AffiliationName": "Western Connecticut Health Network, Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont"}, "7006372286": {"Name": "Berek J.", "AuthorID": "7006372286", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University School of Medicine"}, "7102648625": {"Name": "Randall T.", "AuthorID": "7102648625", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "The Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "36025654200": {"Name": "McCormack M.", "AuthorID": "36025654200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Hospitals London"}, "7801506521": {"Name": "Schmeler K.", "AuthorID": "7801506521", "AffiliationID": "60015023", "AffiliationName": "The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center"}, "7006828259": {"Name": "Manchanda R.", "AuthorID": "7006828259", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57203678009": {"Name": "Rebbeck T.", "AuthorID": "57203678009", "AffiliationID": "60032499, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "Harvard T.H.
