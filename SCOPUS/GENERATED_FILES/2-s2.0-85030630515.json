Using data from three British birth cohorts\u2014born in 1958, 1970 and 2000/1\u2014this paper profiles the family background and personal characteristics of children at state-funded and private fee-paying schools and then investigates the effect of the type of primary school attended on academic progress made during the primary-school years. Applying \u2018value-added\u2019 linear regression and propensity score-matching techniques, we find evidence of a positive association between private primary-school attendance and a child's cognitive progress in all three cohorts. This effect remains after accounting for a wide range of individual and family characteristics, despite the very different times and socio-economic circumstances experienced by the children and their families in the three studies. Findings are discussed and compared against contrasting international findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["academic achievement", "cohort", "longitudinal", "private primary school", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030630515", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57210814494": {"Name": "Parsons S.", "AuthorID": "57210814494", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "35467454700": {"Name": "Green F.", "AuthorID": "35467454700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.B.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "56467722000": {"Name": "Sullivan A.", "AuthorID": "56467722000", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "35821633600": {"Name": "Wiggins R.D.", "AuthorID": "35821633600", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
