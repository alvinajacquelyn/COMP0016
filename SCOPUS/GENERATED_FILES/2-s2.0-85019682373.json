Homology has been proposed between glomus cells, which are neural crest-derived, and the hypoxia-sensitive \u2018neuroepithelial cells\u2019 (NECs) of fish gills, whose embryonic origin is unknown. NECs have also been likened to PNECs, which differentiate in situ within lung airway epithelia. Using genetic lineage-tracing and neural crest-deficient mutants in zebrafish, and physical fate-mapping in frog and lamprey, we find that NECs are not neural crest-derived, but endoderm-derived, like PNECs, whose endodermal origin we confirm. We discover neural crest-derived catecholaminergic cells associated with zebrafish pharyngeal arch blood vessels, and propose a new model for amniote hypoxia-sensitive cell evolution: endoderm-derived NECs were retained as PNECs, while the carotid body evolved via the aggregation of neural crest-derived catecholaminergic (chromaffin) cells already associated with blood vessels in anamniote pharyngeal arches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anura", "Biological Evolution", "Cell Hypoxia", "Cell Lineage", "Lampreys", "Neuroendocrine Cells", "Neuroepithelial Cells", "Zebrafish"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019682373", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"25643020700": {"Name": "Hockman D.", "AuthorID": "25643020700", "AffiliationID": "60000356", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Cape Town"}, "55418221600": {"Name": "Baker C.V.H.", "AuthorID": "55418221600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "35483335400": {"Name": "Burns A.J.", "AuthorID": "35483335400", "AffiliationID": "118578596", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal Drug Discovery Unit, Takeda Pharmaceuticals United States, Inc."}, "57194346653": {"Name": "Jevans B.", "AuthorID": "57194346653", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006236001": {"Name": "Schlosser G.", "AuthorID": "7006236001", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Natural Sciences, National University of Ireland"}, "56007257100": {"Name": "Gates K.P.", "AuthorID": "56007257100", "AffiliationID": "60023242", "AffiliationName": "Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"}, "9733475200": {"Name": "Lancman J.J.", "AuthorID": "9733475200", "AffiliationID": "60023242", "AffiliationName": "Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"}, "35315649400": {"Name": "Dong P.D.S.", "AuthorID": "35315649400", "AffiliationID": "60023242", "AffiliationName": "Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"}, "55207671400": {"Name": "Mongera A.", "AuthorID": "55207671400", "AffiliationID": "60029241, 60117623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, California NanoSystem Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara"}, "7401755794": {"Name": "Fisher S.", "AuthorID": "7401755794", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology & Experimental Therapeutics, Boston University School of Medicine"}, "55976535100": {"Name": "Unlu G.", "AuthorID": "55976535100", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "16947222700": {"Name": "Knapik E.W.", "AuthorID": "16947222700", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetic Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}, "35173225500": {"Name": "Kaufman C.K.", "AuthorID": "35173225500", "AffiliationID": "60022756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University School of Medicine"}, "14009379800": {"Name": "Mosimann C.", "AuthorID": "14009379800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "7102121068": {"Name": "Zon L.I.", "AuthorID": "7102121068", "AffiliationID": "60009470, 60002746, 60030521", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Hospital Boston, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School"}, "6602292677": {"Name": "Lickert H.", "AuthorID": "6602292677", "AffiliationID": "60024007", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Diabetes and Regeneration Research, Helmholtz Zentrum M\u00fcnchen"}, "7202049678": {"Name": "Tucker A.S.", "AuthorID": "7202049678", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Craniofacial Development and Stem Cell Biology, King\u2019s College London"}}}
