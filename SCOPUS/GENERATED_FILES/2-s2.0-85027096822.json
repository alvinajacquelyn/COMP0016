This work evaluated the impact of surface modifications of mannosamine-conjugated multifunctional poly(glutamic acid) (PG)-dendrimers as nanocarriers of the tumour associated antigens (TAA) MART-1, gp100:44 and gp100:209. Molecular dynamics simulations and docking studies were performed. Nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-PG-G4-dendrimer displayed 64 carboxylic groups, however, the Frontier Molecular Orbital Theory study evidenced that only 32 of those were available to form covalent bonds. When the number of mannosamines conjugated to dendrimer was increased from 16 to 32, the dendrimer interacted with the receptor with higher affinity. However, 16 mannosamines-NBD-PG-G4-dendrimer was chosen to conjugate TAA for added functionality as no carboxylic end groups were available for further conjugation in the 32 mannosamines-dendrimer. Docking results showed that the majority of TAA-conjugated NBD-PG-G4-dendrimer demonstrated a favourable interaction with mannosamine binding site on mannose receptor, thus constituting a promising tool for TAA targeted delivery. Our in silico approach effectively narrows down the selection of the best candidates for the synthesis of functionalised PG-dendrimers with desired functionalities. These results will significantly reduce the time and efforts required to experimentally synthesise modified dendrimers for optimal antigen delivery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer", "computational design", "immunotherapy", "molecular dynamics simulation", "Peptide dendrimer", "poly(glutamic acid)", "receptor docking", "tumour associated antigens"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Antigens, Neoplasm", "Cancer Vaccines", "Computers, Molecular", "Dendrimers", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Polyglutamic Acid", "Protein Structure, Secondary", "Protein Structure, Tertiary", "Vaccination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027096822", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"37661789300": {"Name": "Moura L.I.F.", "AuthorID": "37661789300", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "57195324294": {"Name": "Martinho N.", "AuthorID": "57195324294", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8282140100": {"Name": "Silva L.C.", "AuthorID": "8282140100", "AffiliationID": "60006217, 60106051, 60004956", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Qu\u00edmica-F\u00edsica Molecular and Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "24402599300": {"Name": "Florindo H.F.", "AuthorID": "24402599300", "AffiliationID": "60016187, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Research Institute for Medicines (iMed.ULisboa), Universidade de Lisboa"}, "6603596752": {"Name": "Zloh M.", "AuthorID": "6603596752", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Medical Sciences, University of Hertfordshire"}, "36888034500": {"Name": "Barata T.S.", "AuthorID": "36888034500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "6701323615": {"Name": "Brocchini S.", "AuthorID": "6701323615", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutics, UCL School of Pharmacy"}}}
