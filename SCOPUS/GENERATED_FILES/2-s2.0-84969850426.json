HIV-1 RNA can be at higher levels in CSF than plasma, termed CSF/plasma discordance. We aimed to examine whether discordance in CSF is associated with low level viraemia (LLV) in blood. In this MRC-funded multicentre study, we prospectively recruited patients with LLV, defined as one or more episode of unexplained plasma HIV-1 RNA within 12 months, and undertook CSF examination. Separately, we prospectively collected CSF from patients undergoing lumbar puncture for a clinical indication. Patients with durable suppression of viraemia and no evidence of CNS infection were identified as controls from this group. Factors associated with CSF/plasma HIV-1 discordance overall were examined. One hundred fifty-three patients were recruited across 13 sites; 40 with LLV and 113 undergoing clinical lumbar puncture. Seven of the 40 (18 %) patients with LLV had CSF/plasma discordance, which was significantly more than 0/43 (0 %) with durable suppression in blood from the clinical group (p = 0.005). Resistance associated mutations were shown in six CSF samples from discordant patients with LLV (one had insufficient sample for testing), which affected antiretroviral therapy at sampling in five. Overall discordance was present in 20/153 (13 %) and was associated with nadir CD4 but not antiretroviral concentrations in plasma or CSF. CSF/plasma discordance is observed in patients with LLV and is associated with antiretroviral resistance associated mutations in CSF. The implications for clinical practice require further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiretroviral agents", "Central nervous system", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Drug resistance", "HIV", "Viral"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-HIV Agents", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Central Nervous System", "Drug Resistance, Viral", "Female", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Prospective Studies", "RNA, Viral", "Viremia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969850426", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"54395910100": {"Name": "Nightingale S.", "AuthorID": "54395910100", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "6701366859": {"Name": "Geretti A.M.", "AuthorID": "6701366859", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "26654732600": {"Name": "Beloukas A.", "AuthorID": "26654732600", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "7102024641": {"Name": "Solomon T.", "AuthorID": "7102024641", "AffiliationID": "60020921", "AffiliationName": "Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "25640566500": {"Name": "Else L.", "AuthorID": "25640566500", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "35185756300": {"Name": "Watson V.", "AuthorID": "35185756300", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "7006669713": {"Name": "Pirmohamed M.", "AuthorID": "7006669713", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "7102023740": {"Name": "Khoo S.", "AuthorID": "7102023740", "AffiliationID": "60160274", "AffiliationName": "Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57203665899": {"Name": "Fisher M.", "AuthorID": "57203665899", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "11638976900": {"Name": "Winston A.", "AuthorID": "11638976900", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "St Marys\u2019 Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7403461374": {"Name": "Nelson M.", "AuthorID": "7403461374", "AffiliationID": "60032993", "AffiliationName": "St Stephen\u2019s AIDS Research Trust and Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57201772996": {"Name": "Taylor S.", "AuthorID": "57201772996", "AffiliationID": "60024356, 60026493", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602482250": {"Name": "Ustianowski A.", "AuthorID": "6602482250", "AffiliationID": "60007321, 60009274", "AffiliationName": "North Manchester General Hospital, Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55319142500": {"Name": "Ainsworth J.", "AuthorID": "55319142500", "AffiliationID": "60018901", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust"}, "56562665800": {"Name": "Gilson R.", "AuthorID": "56562665800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "55941510300": {"Name": "Haddow L.", "AuthorID": "55941510300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "7102728961": {"Name": "Ong E.", "AuthorID": "7102728961", "AffiliationID": "60024240, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Victoria Royal Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "16747269600": {"Name": "Leen C.", "AuthorID": "16747269600", "AffiliationID": "60002975, 60004120", "AffiliationName": "Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian"}, "55394254500": {"Name": "Minton J.", "AuthorID": "55394254500", "AffiliationID": "60006866, 60012508", "AffiliationName": "Leeds General Infirmary, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7005967261": {"Name": "Post F.", "AuthorID": "7005967261", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
