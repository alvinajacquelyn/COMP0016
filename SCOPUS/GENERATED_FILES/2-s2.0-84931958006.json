Minimal change (MC-MSA) is an unusual MSA subtype with neuronal loss largely restricted to the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. Methods: Immunohistochemistry on selected brain regions and semiquantitative assessment were performed on six MC-MSA and eight MSA control cases. Results: More neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were seen in the caudate and substantia nigra in MC-MSA than in MSA controls (P=0.002), without any statistical difference in glial cytoplasmic inclusion load in any region. Severe glial cytoplasmic inclusion load was found in the ventrolateral medulla (P=1.0) and nucleus raphe obscurus (P=0.4) in both groups. When compared with MSA controls, the three MC-MSA cases who had died of sudden unexpected death had an earlier age of onset (mean: 38 vs. 57.6 y, P=0.02), a numerically shorter disease duration (mean: 5.3 vs. 8 y, P=0.2) and a more rapid clinical progression with most of the clinical milestones reached within 3 y of presentation, suggesting an aggressive variant of MSA. Another three MC-MSA cases, who had died of unrelated concurrent diseases, had an age of onset (mean: 57.7 y) and temporal course similar to controls, had less severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the medial and dorsolateral substantia nigra subregions (P<0.05) than in MSA controls, and could be considered as a unique group with interrupted pathological progression. Significant respiratory dysfunction and early orthostatic hypotension were observed in all MC-MSA cases. Conclusions: Our findings could suggest that \u03b1-synuclein-associated oligodendroglial pathology may lead to neuronal dysfunction sufficient to cause clinical symptoms before overt neuronal loss in MSA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha-synuclein", "Minimal change", "Multiple system atrophy", "Sudden unexpected death"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "alpha-Synuclein", "Brain", "Humans", "Inclusion Bodies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Tissue Banks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931958006", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24781067400": {"Name": "Ling H.", "AuthorID": "24781067400", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "54885244600": {"Name": "Asi Y.T.", "AuthorID": "54885244600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "14009978300": {"Name": "Ahmed Z.", "AuthorID": "14009978300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57208252964": {"Name": "Lees A.J.", "AuthorID": "57208252964", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7102381695": {"Name": "Revesz T.", "AuthorID": "7102381695", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7101772051": {"Name": "Holton J.L.", "AuthorID": "7101772051", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square Brain Bank, Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004083314": {"Name": "Petrovic I.N.", "AuthorID": "7004083314", "AffiliationID": "60068827", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, School of Medicine"}, "55330727200": {"Name": "Prashanth L.K.", "AuthorID": "55330727200", "AffiliationID": "60002401", "AffiliationName": "Edmond J.
