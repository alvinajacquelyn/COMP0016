The h-version of the CIP finite element method with piecewise linear approximation is applied to a one-dimensional (1D) model problem. We first show discrete well posedness and convergence results, using the imaginary part of the stabilization operator, for the complex Helmholtz equation. Then we consider a method with real valued penalty parameter and prove an error estimate of the discrete solution in the H1-norm, as the sum of best approximation error plus a pollution term that is the order of the phase difference. It is proved that the pollution effect can be eliminated by selecting the penalty parameter appropriately. As a result of this analysis, thorough and rigorous understanding of the error behavior throughout the range of convergence is gained. Numerical results are presented that show sharpness of the error estimates and highlight some phenomena of the discrete solution behavior. In particular, we give numerical evidence that the optimal penalty parameter obtained in the 1D case also works very well for the CIP-FEM on two-dimensional Cartesian grids.\u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
