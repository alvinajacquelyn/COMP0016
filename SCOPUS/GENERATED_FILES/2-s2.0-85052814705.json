American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Recent years have seen growing interest in improving seasonal predictions of Arctic sea ice conditions, including the timing of ice melt onset and retreat, especially on the regional scale. This paper investigates potential links between regional sea ice melt onset and retreat in the southern Laptev Sea and retreat of terrestrial snow cover. Past studies have shown that variability of snow extent over Eurasia can substantially impact regional atmospheric circulation patterns over the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans. It is shown here that for the Laptev Sea, earlier melt onset and retreat of sea ice are encouraged by earlier retreat of snow cover over the West Siberian Plain. Earlier snow retreat in spring encourages greater ridging (e.g., at 500 hPa) over the East Siberian Sea through the summer. This results in more frequently southerly flow of warm, moist air over the Laptev Sea. This relationship could provide modest improvements to predictive skill for sea ice melt onset and retreat in the southern Laptev Sea at lead times of approximately 50 and 90 days, respectively. The detrended time series of snow retreat in the West Siberian Plain explains 26 and 29% of the detrended variance of the timing of sea ice melt onset and retreat in southern Laptev Sea, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arctic", "Laptev Sea", "sea ice melt onset", "sea ice predictability", "sea ice retreat", "surface-atmosphere interactions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052814705", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"56492284300": {"Name": "Crawford A.", "AuthorID": "56492284300", "AffiliationID": "60007957", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, The College of Wooster"}, "57203746471": {"Name": "Horvath S.", "AuthorID": "57203746471", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder"}, "6602079010": {"Name": "Stroeve J.", "AuthorID": "6602079010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Earth Sciences Department, University College of London"}, "7003455444": {"Name": "Serreze M.", "AuthorID": "7003455444", "AffiliationID": "60000221, 60008778", "AffiliationName": "National Snow and Ice Data Center, Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, University of Colorado Boulder"}, "55831730200": {"Name": "Balaji R.", "AuthorID": "55831730200", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, University of Colorado Boulder"}}}
