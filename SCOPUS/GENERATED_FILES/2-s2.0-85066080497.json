We aimed to determine whether UDCA prolongs liver transplant (LT)-free survival in patients with PBC. Methods: This international cohort study included patients from the Global PBC Study Group database, originating from 8 countries in Europe and North America. Both UDCA-treated and untreated patients were included. LT and death were assessed as a combined endpoint through Cox regression analyses, with inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW). Results: In the 3,902 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 54.3 (11.9) years, 3,552 patients (94.0%) were female, 3,529 patients (90.4%) were treated with UDCA and 373 patients (9.6%) were not treated. The median (interquartile range) follow-up was 7.8 (4.1\u201312.1) years. In total, 721 UDCA-treated patients and 145 untreated patients died or underwent LT. After IPTW, the 10-year cumulative LT-free survival was 79.7% (95% CI 78.1\u201381.2) among UDCA-treated patients and 60.7% (95% CI 58.2\u201363.4) among untreated patients (p <0.001). UDCA was associated with a statistically significant reduced risk of LT or death (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.40\u20130.52; p <0.001). The hazard ratio remained statistically significant in all stages of disease. Patients classified as inadequate biochemical responders after 1 year of UDCA had a lower risk of LT or death than patients who were not treated (adjusted hazard ratio 0.56; 95% CI 0.45\u20130.69; p <0.001). Conclusion: The use of UDCA improves LT-free survival among patients with PBC, regardless of the disease stage and the observed biochemical response. These findings support UDCA as the current universal standard of care in PBC. Lay summary: In this international multicenter study of 3,902 patients with primary biliary cholangitis, we found that treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid is associated with prolonged liver transplant-free survival. This association was significant, irrespective of sex, age, or disease stage. The survival benefit remained statistically significant in patients with an incomplete biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cholestasis", "Clinical trials", "Mortality", "Patient management", "Treatment", "UDCA, transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cholagogues and Choleretics", "Cholangitis", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk", "Survival Rate", "Treatment Outcome", "Ursodeoxycholic Acid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066080497", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"57004486800": {"Name": "Harms M.H.", "AuthorID": "57004486800", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "7005787033": {"Name": "van Buuren H.R.", "AuthorID": "7005787033", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "56204530800": {"Name": "Lammers W.J.", "AuthorID": "56204530800", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "7403015330": {"Name": "Hansen B.E.", "AuthorID": "7403015330", "AffiliationID": "60023022", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Centre for Liver Disease, Francis Family Liver Clinic, Toronto General Hospital"}, "30267977400": {"Name": "van der Meer A.J.", "AuthorID": "30267977400", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus University Medical Center"}, "7003499798": {"Name": "Corpechot C.", "AuthorID": "7003499798", "AffiliationID": "60009907, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Centre de R\u00e9f\u00e9rence des Maladies Inflammatoires des Voies Biliaires, H\u00f4pital Saint-Antoine, APHP"}, "55217322300": {"Name": "Thorburn D.", "AuthorID": "55217322300", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, and UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, The Royal Free Hospital"}, "56489785600": {"Name": "Janssen H.L.A.", "AuthorID": "56489785600", "AffiliationID": "60023022", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Centre for Liver Disease, Francis Family Liver Clinic, Toronto General Hospital"}, "57196427048": {"Name": "Hirschfield G.M.", "AuthorID": "57196427048", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60172612", "AffiliationName": "Birmingham NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, and Centre for Liver Research, University of Birmingham"}, "35418813000": {"Name": "Lindor K.D.", "AuthorID": "35418813000", "AffiliationID": "60026952", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic"}, "7006203801": {"Name": "Par\u00e9s A.", "AuthorID": "7006203801", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60030315, 60078879, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Hospital Cl\u00ednic, CIBERehd, IDIBAPS, University of Barcelona"}, "57198174928": {"Name": "Floreani A.", "AuthorID": "57198174928", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua"}, "7202350380": {"Name": "Mayo M.J.", "AuthorID": "7202350380", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": "Digestive and Liver Diseases, UT Southwestern Medical Center"}, "57214121395": {"Name": "Invernizzi P.", "AuthorID": "57214121395", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Program for Autoimmune Liver Diseases, International Center for Digestive Health, Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milan-Bicocca"}, "7004451577": {"Name": "Battezzati P.M.", "AuthorID": "7004451577", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "57213198642": {"Name": "Nevens F.", "AuthorID": "57213198642", "AffiliationID": "60031069, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, University Hospitals Leuven, KU Leuven"}, "6603011675": {"Name": "Ponsioen C.Y.", "AuthorID": "6603011675", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Academic Medical Center"}, "12241252000": {"Name": "Mason A.L.", "AuthorID": "12241252000", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Alberta"}, "57203215425": {"Name": "Kowdley K.V.", "AuthorID": "57203215425", "AffiliationID": "60011874", "AffiliationName": "Liver Care Network and Organ Care Research, Swedish Medical Center"}}}
