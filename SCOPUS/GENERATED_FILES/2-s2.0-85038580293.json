The binding volume is the pressure derivative of the Gibbs energy, thus elevated pressure is required to determine the volumetric properties of proteins. Here we describe the use of high-pressure spectrofluorimetry to determine both unfolding and ligand binding- induced volume changes of a protein. The degree of protein unfolding at elevated pressures was monitored by an intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Different approaches of experimental fluorescence spectra analysis are described and the impact on the quality of thermodynamic parameters is discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Elevated pressure", "Fluorescence spectra", "Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescences", "Pressure derivatives", "Protein-ligand interactions", "Spectrofluorimetry", "Thermodynamic parameter", "Volumetric properties"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038580293", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191329759": {"Name": "Skvarnavi\u010dius G.", "AuthorID": "57191329759", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design, Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University"}, "37056537700": {"Name": "Toleikis Z.", "AuthorID": "37056537700", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design, Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University"}, "56891413900": {"Name": "Grigaliunas M.", "AuthorID": "56891413900", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design, Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University"}, "56433606800": {"Name": "Smirnoviene J.", "AuthorID": "56433606800", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design, Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University"}, "55022701100": {"Name": "Norvai\u0161as P.", "AuthorID": "55022701100", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design, Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University"}, "16401062300": {"Name": "Cimmperman P.", "AuthorID": "16401062300", "AffiliationID": "60172254", "AffiliationName": "Baltic Institute of Advanced Technology"}, "6602001226": {"Name": "Matulis D.", "AuthorID": "6602001226", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design, Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University"}, "8270333300": {"Name": "Petrauskas V.", "AuthorID": "8270333300", "AffiliationID": "60059987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biothermodynamics and Drug Design, Institute of Biotechnology, Vilnius University"}}}
