Methods: In 3,205 subjects (60-75 years) from the Czech Republic, we assessed relationship between PF, SEP, and age. Linear regression was used to assess PF measures and SEP measures. Results: Crosssectional decline in PF by age was similar in all individuals. Differences between SEP groups were similar across age groups, except for the difference in walk speed by material circumstances in men-bigger at older ages (p =.004). Men and women with the highest education were about 2 s faster at the chair rise test than those with the lowest education. Discussion: Findings suggest strong educational gradient in PF, an inconsistent role of self-assessed material circumstances, and virtually no interaction of SEP with the cross-sectional decline in PF by age.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Chair rise", "Education", "Grip strength", "Material circumstances", "Walk speed"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acceleration", "Aged", "Aging", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Czech Republic", "Exercise", "Female", "Hand Strength", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Physical Fitness", "Posture", "Social Facilitation", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Walking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925189862", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"56705542300": {"Name": "Jancova-Vseteckova J.", "AuthorID": "56705542300", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Social Care, Open University"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8681509900": {"Name": "Peasey A.", "AuthorID": "8681509900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35418876900": {"Name": "Marmot M.", "AuthorID": "35418876900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6701399454": {"Name": "Kubinova R.", "AuthorID": "6701399454", "AffiliationID": "60012911", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Health, National Institute of Public Health"}, "24464239700": {"Name": "Capkova N.", "AuthorID": "24464239700", "AffiliationID": "60012911", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Health, National Institute of Public Health"}}}
