We conducted adult SARI surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi. From January 2011 to December 2013, individuals aged \u2265 15 years with SARI (both inpatients and outpatients) were enrolled at a large teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We estimated hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI incidence rates and assessed factors associated with influenza positivity and clinical severity (Modified Early Warning Score > 4). We enrolled 1, 126 SARI cases; 163 (14.5%) were positive for influenza. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence was 50.3%. Annual incidence of hospital-attended influenza-associated SARI was 9.7-16.8 cases per 100,000 population. Human immunodeficiency virus was associated with a 5-fold greater incidence (incidence rate ratio 4.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.83-6.32). Onmultivariable analysis, female gender, as well as recruitment in hot, rainy season (December to March; adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.82, 95% CI: 1.57-5.06) and cool, dry season (April to August; a OR: 2.47, 95% CI: 1.35-4.15), was associated with influenza positivity, whereas influenza-positive patients were less likely to be HIV-infected (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43-0.80) or have viral coinfection (aOR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.36-0.73). Human immunodeficiency virus infection (aOR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.35-2.56) and recruitment inhot, rainy season (aOR: 4.98, 95% CI: 3.17-7.81) were independently associated with clinical severity. In this high HIV prevalence population, influenza was associated with nearly 15% of hospital-attended SARI. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is an important risk factor for clinical severity in all-cause and influenza-associated SARI. Expanded access to HIV testing and antiretroviral treatment, as well as targeted influenza vaccination, may reduce the burden of SARI in Malawi and other high HIV prevalence settings.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Influenza, Human", "Malawi", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Odds Ratio", "Population Surveillance", "Poverty", "Risk Factors", "Seasons", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053026533", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57209310758": {"Name": "Ho A.", "AuthorID": "57209310758", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "25031537700": {"Name": "Mallewa J.", "AuthorID": "25031537700", "AffiliationID": "60072679", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"}, "35300534900": {"Name": "Peterson I.", "AuthorID": "35300534900", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "8372787000": {"Name": "Bar-Zeev N.", "AuthorID": "8372787000", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "54795601200": {"Name": "Menyere M.", "AuthorID": "54795601200", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "23977468600": {"Name": "Alaerts M.", "AuthorID": "23977468600", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "57193012426": {"Name": "Mapurisa G.", "AuthorID": "57193012426", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "55631780500": {"Name": "Chilombe M.", "AuthorID": "55631780500", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme, College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "34975060700": {"Name": "French N.", "AuthorID": "34975060700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Infection and Global Health, University of Liverpool"}, "19933714900": {"Name": "Everett D.", "AuthorID": "19933714900", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh"}, "16048316500": {"Name": "Nyirenda M.", "AuthorID": "16048316500", "AffiliationID": "60072679", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital"}, "57193527618": {"Name": "Joaquin M.S.", "AuthorID": "57193527618", "AffiliationID": "60112834", "AffiliationName": "World Bank"}, "55553726717": {"Name": "Garg S.", "AuthorID": "55553726717", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "24829503800": {"Name": "McMorrow M.", "AuthorID": "24829503800", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Influenza Division, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "7004734207": {"Name": "Lalloo D.G.", "AuthorID": "7004734207", "AffiliationID": "60020934", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine"}, "54080349100": {"Name": "Rothe C.", "AuthorID": "54080349100", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich"}, "26429004600": {"Name": "Widdowson M.A.", "AuthorID": "26429004600", "AffiliationID": "60021658", "AffiliationName": "Division of Global Health Protection, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
