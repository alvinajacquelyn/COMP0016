Much effort has been devoted to understanding how density of people affects collective human motion in the context of pedestrian flows. However, there is a distinct lack of empirical data investigating the effects of social density on human behaviour in cooperative contexts. Here, we examine the functioning and performance of human teams in a central-place foraging arena using high-resolution GPS data. We show that team functioning (level of coordination) is greatest at intermediate social densities, but contrary to our expectations, increased coordination at intermediate densities did not translate into improved collective foraging performance, and foraging accuracy was equivalent across our density treatments. We suggest that this is likely a consequence of foragers relying upon visual channels (local information) to achieve coordination but relying upon auditory channels (global information) to maximise foraging returns. These findings provide new insights for the development of more sophisticated models of human collective behaviour that consider different networks for communication (e.g. visual and vocal) that have the potential to operate simultaneously in cooperative contexts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Algorithms", "Analysis of Variance", "Cooperative Behavior", "Decision Making", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Group Processes", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychomotor Performance", "Social Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950281306", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"35752030300": {"Name": "King A.J.", "AuthorID": "35752030300", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Biosciences, College of Science, Swansea University, Singleton Park"}, "36018394000": {"Name": "F\u00fcrtbauer I.", "AuthorID": "36018394000", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Biosciences, College of Science, Swansea University, Singleton Park"}, "25422258100": {"Name": "Myatt J.P.", "AuthorID": "25422258100", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Biosciences, University of Birmingham"}, "47761461100": {"Name": "Oesch N.", "AuthorID": "47761461100", "AffiliationID": "124943160", "AffiliationName": "SENRG, Department of Experimental Psychology"}, "57198094444": {"Name": "Dunbar R.I.M.", "AuthorID": "57198094444", "AffiliationID": "124943160", "AffiliationName": "SENRG, Department of Experimental Psychology"}, "7005759495": {"Name": "Sumner S.", "AuthorID": "7005759495", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "6603291500": {"Name": "Usherwood J.R.", "AuthorID": "6603291500", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Structure and Motion Laboratory, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6602657397": {"Name": "Hailes S.", "AuthorID": "6602657397", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55487973800": {"Name": "Brown M.R.", "AuthorID": "55487973800", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Swansea University, Bay Campus"}}}
