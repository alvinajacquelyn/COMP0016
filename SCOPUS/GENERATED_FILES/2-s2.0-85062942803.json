All rights reserved.Biomedical research has been instrumental in identifying key molecular and cellular changes that occur throughout the aging process, also known as the Hallmarks of Aging. Notably, these are shared between humans and several other species that have served as models for the study of aging in the laboratory. In this chapter, we discuss current knowledge regarding the significance of hallmarks such as: decay of stem cell function, acquisition of genomic instability, DNA damage, telomere attrition, deregulated nutrient sensing, chronic inflammation and cellular senescence. We further describe current methodological issues, experimental techniques and best practices for the study of each hallmark across different in vivo and in vitro systems, while also pointing at their limitations. Finally, we provide future perspectives for the improvement of experimental designs in biomedical research of aging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA-damage", "Epigenetics", "Inflammation", "mTOR", "SASP", "Senescence", "Stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062942803", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57191618157": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Meljem J.M.", "AuthorID": "57191618157", "AffiliationID": "60108388", "AffiliationName": "Department of Basic Research, National Institute of Geriatrics"}, "56746333600": {"Name": "Haston S.", "AuthorID": "56746333600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Research Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56375113400": {"Name": "Gallage S.", "AuthorID": "56375113400", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chronic Inflammation and Cancer, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)"}, "56401663200": {"Name": "Innes A.J.", "AuthorID": "56401663200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Haematology, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
