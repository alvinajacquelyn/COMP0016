By using two uncorrelated lasers, this system concept allows simple implementation that can additionally be improved, if thermally uncooled lasers are used. Although such asynchronous receiver design is mildly affected by the laser phase noise, it suffers from the wavelength drift that occurs between the uncooled laser sources. Also, there are performance penalties due to high laser line-width when complex modulation formats are used for transmission. In this work, we analyze the performance of heterodyne based optical receivers, using OOK and multilevel modulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["60 GHz", "DWDM-PON", "Radio over Fiber", "Wireless integration"], "IndexKeywords": ["60 GHz", "DWDM-PON", "Heterodyne detection", "Multilevel modulation", "Performance penalties", "Radio over fiber system", "Remote antenna unit (RAUs)", "Wireless integration"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923879635", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"8411595900": {"Name": "Medeiros M.", "AuthorID": "8411595900", "AffiliationID": "60020985, 60106434", "AffiliationName": "IT-Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Departamento de Engenharia Eletrot\u00e9cnica e de Computadores, Universidade de Coimbra"}, "56114372900": {"Name": "Thakur M.", "AuthorID": "56114372900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "7801636324": {"Name": "Mikroulis S.", "AuthorID": "7801636324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}, "8207205100": {"Name": "Mitchell J.", "AuthorID": "8207205100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Electronic and Electrical Engineering"}}}
