This optical parameter estimation problem is an ill-posed inverse problem, and thus it is sensitive to measurement and modelling errors. Therefore, light propagation in quantitative photoacoustic tomography needs to be accurately modelled. A widely accepted model for light propagation in biological tissue is the radiative transfer equation. In this work, the radiative transfer equation is utilised in quantitative photoacoustic tomography. Estimating absorption and scattering distributions in quantitative photoacoustic tomography using various illuminations is investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inverse problems", "Quantitative photoacoustic tomography", "Radiative transfer equation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption and scatterings", "Biological tissues", "ILL-posed inverse problem", "Modelling error", "Optical parameter", "Photoacoustic image", "Photoacoustic tomography", "Radiative transfer equations"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019176664", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"8283868000": {"Name": "Tarvainen T.", "AuthorID": "8283868000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "35369220800": {"Name": "Pulkkinen A.", "AuthorID": "35369220800", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
