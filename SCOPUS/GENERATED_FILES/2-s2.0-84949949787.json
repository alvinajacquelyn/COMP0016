Using an analogue approach, we tested if medication beliefs predict whether participants misattribute a headache as a side effect and subsequently intend to stop medication. Methods: We recruited 690 participants, 223 reporting a past asthma diagnosis. They received information about asthma and Molair, a fictitious asthma treatment modeled on a licensed treatment (montelukast). We varied the description of efficacy and side effects (which did not include headache). Pre-exposure to this information, participants completed the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ)-General and the Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines Scale (PSM), post-exposure they completed the BMQ-Specific. Participants were asked to imagine they experienced a headache while taking Molair. Finally, they rated whether the headache was a side effect (misattribution) and if they would stop taking Molair (behavioral intention). Results: Nearly a quarter (170) of participants misattributed the headache to Molair and 69 (10%) subsequently intended to stop Molair. Both outcomes were predicted by general and specific medication beliefs. Odds of misattribution (m) and behavioral intention (i) increased with higher General Harm (ORm = 1.90, ORi = 2.72), General Overuse (ORm = 1.74, ORi = 1.56) and Molair Concern beliefs (ORm = 1.52, ORi = 1.78, all p < .01), but decreased with General Benefit (ORm = 0.72, ORi = 0.53) and Molair Necessity beliefs (ORm = 0.72, ORi = 0.70, all p < .05). Conclusion: Symptom misattribution and subsequent intentions to stop Molair were predicted by pre-exposure beliefs about medicines in general and post-exposure beliefs about Molair. Patients with negative medication beliefs may be prone to misattribute symptoms and subsequently stop medication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adherence", "Asthma", "Attribution", "Beliefs about medicines", "Nocebo", "Side effects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acetates", "Adult", "Anti-Asthmatic Agents", "Asthma", "Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Perception", "Quinolines", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949949787", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57004314500": {"Name": "Heller M.", "AuthorID": "57004314500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Medicine, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7403044091": {"Name": "Chapman S.", "AuthorID": "7403044091", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Medicine, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "23012144600": {"Name": "Horne R.", "AuthorID": "23012144600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60016379", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behavioural Medicine, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
