Materials and methods Polypropylene (PPGDMA) or triethylene (TEGDMA) glycol dimethacrylates (25 wt%) dilu-ents were combined with urethane dimethacrylate (70 wt%) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (5 wt%). 70 wt% filler containing glass particles, glass fibers (20 wt%) and polylysine (5 wt %) was added. Benzoyl peroxide and MCPM (10 or 20 wt%) or N-tolyglycine glycidyl methacrylate and tristrontium phosphate (15 wt%) were included to give initiator or activator pastes. Commercial PMMA (Simplex) and bone composite (Cortoss) were used for comparison. ATR-FTIR was used to determine thermal activated polymerization kinetics of initiator pastes at 50\u201380C. Paste stability, following storage at 4\u201337C, was assessed visually or through mixed paste polymerization kinetics at 25C. Polymerization shrinkage and heat generation were calculated from final monomer conversions. Subsequent expansion and surface apatite precipitation in simulated body fluid (SBF) were assessed gravimetrically and via SEM. Strontium release into water was assessed using ICP-MS. Biaxial flexural strength (BFS) and fatigue properties were determined at 37C after 4 weeks in SBF. Results Polymerization profiles all exhibited an inhibition time before polymerization as predicted by free radical polymerization mechanisms. Initiator paste inhibition times and maximum reaction rates were described well by Arrhenius plots. Plot extrapolation, however, underestimated lower temperature paste stability. Replacement of TEGDMA by PPGDMA, enhanced paste stability, final monomer conversion, water-sorption induced expansion and strontium release but reduced polymerization shrinkage and heat generation. Increasing MCPM level enhanced volume expansion, surface apatite precipitation and strontium release. Although the experimental composite flexural strengths were lower compared to those of commercially available Simplex, the extrapolated low load fatigue lives of all materials were comparable. Conclusions Increased inhibition times at high temperature give longer predicted shelf-life whilst stability of mixed paste inhibition times is important for consistent clinical application. Increased volumetric stability, strontium release and apatite formation should encourage bone integration. Replacing TEGDMA by PPGDMA and increasing MCPM could therefore increase suitability of the above novel bone composites for vertebroplasty. Long fatigue lives of the composites may also ensure long-term durability of the materials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Apatites", "Body Fluids", "Bone Cements", "Dental Materials", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Materials Testing", "Polymerization", "Strontium", "Surface Properties", "Vertebroplasty"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063218609", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57191536112": {"Name": "Panpisut P.", "AuthorID": "57191536112", "AffiliationID": "60012521", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Dentistry, Thammasat University"}, "55854152800": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "55854152800", "AffiliationID": "60041724", "AffiliationName": "Science of Dental Material, Khyber College of Dentistry, Khyber Teaching Hospital (MTI)"}, "55853874600": {"Name": "Main K.", "AuthorID": "55853874600", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "57207910059": {"Name": "Arshad M.", "AuthorID": "57207910059", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "56051736700": {"Name": "Xia W.", "AuthorID": "56051736700", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "55506195900": {"Name": "Young A.", "AuthorID": "55506195900", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}, "6602244656": {"Name": "Petridis H.", "AuthorID": "6602244656", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Restorative Dentistry, Unit of Prosthodontics, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
