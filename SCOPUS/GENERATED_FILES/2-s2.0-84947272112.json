On initial exposure an amorphous multilayer of adsorbed ethanol is observed, but over ca. 30 min a loss in intensity of \u03bd(OH) and \u03b4(OH) bands indicates a preferential binding of the ethanol -OH with the ND surface. Other spectral changes indicate ordering of the ethanol molecules on the surface and their confinement within the pores of the ND structure in specific conformations. Changes in the IR spectrum also suggest that vibrational frequencies of carbonyl groups on the ND surface are affected by the adsorption of ethanol and that surface-bound water is either displaced or involved in hydrogen-bonding with ethanol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nanodiamond", "Solvents", "Spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adsorption of ethanol", "Amorphous multilayers", "Attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy", "Carbonyl groups", "Preferential binding", "Situ infrared spectroscopy", "Surface interactions", "Surface-bound water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947272112", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56048603600": {"Name": "Inel G.", "AuthorID": "56048603600", "AffiliationID": "60003161, 60001478", "AffiliationName": "Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, Faculty of Applied Chemistry and Materials Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest"}, "56964326600": {"Name": "Ungureau E.", "AuthorID": "56964326600", "AffiliationID": "60003161, 60001478", "AffiliationName": "Department of Inorganic Chemistry, Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry, Faculty of Applied Chemistry and Materials Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest"}, "16644523500": {"Name": "Varley T.", "AuthorID": "16644523500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56437672200": {"Name": "Hirani M.", "AuthorID": "56437672200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005668268": {"Name": "Holt K.", "AuthorID": "7005668268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
