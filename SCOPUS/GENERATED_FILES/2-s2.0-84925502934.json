Initially, the focus is on the nervous control of the heart by ATP as a cotransmitter in sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory nerves, as well as in intracardiac neurons. Control of the heart by centers in the brain and vagal cardiovascular reflexes involving purines are also discussed. The actions of adenine nucleotides and nucleosides on cardiomyocytes, atrioventricular and sinoatrial nodes, cardiac fibroblasts, and coronary blood vessels are described. Cardiac release and degradation of ATP are also described. Finally, the involvement of purinergic signalling and its therapeutic potential in cardiac pathophysiology is reviewed, including acute and chronic heart failure, ischemia, infarction, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, syncope, hypertrophy, coronary artery disease, angina, diabetic cardiomyopathy, as well as heart transplantation and coronary bypass grafts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adenosine", "ATP", "Cardiomyocytes", "Coronary vessels", "Innervation", "Pathophysiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Heart Diseases", "Humans", "Myocardium", "Receptors, Purinergic", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925502934", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36037094600": {"Name": "Burnstock G.", "AuthorID": "36037094600", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, The University of Melbourne"}, "7005714379": {"Name": "Pelleg A.", "AuthorID": "7005714379", "AffiliationID": "60022890", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Drexel University"}}}
