Our secondary aim was to analyse the association between DM development and hepatic fibrosis.METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study. Patients from the Icona Foundation study initiating first-line cART between 1997 and 2013 were selected and observed until new-onset DM or most recent clinical follow-up. The predictive value of TRG and TRG/HDL ratio levels on DM was evaluated using multivariable Poisson regression models.RESULTS: Three-thousand, five-hundred and forty-six patients (males, 73.7%; median age, 38 years; median BMI, 23.1 kg/m(2); and hepatitis C virus antibody positive, 22.1%) were included. Of these, 80 developed DM over 13 911 person-years of follow-up (PYFU), corresponding to 5.7 cases per 1000 PYFU (95% CI = 4.6-7.1). At multivariable analysis, latest TRG/HDL ratio, when high, was associated with significant increases in DM risk [relative risk (RR) = 1.63; 95% CI = 1.32-2.01 per 10 points higher], while current TRG, in contrast, was associated with new-onset DM only at crude analysis. Advanced liver fibrosis (defined as fibrosis-4 index >3.25) was also shown to be an independent risk factor for DM (RR = 2.91; 95% CI = 1.10-7.72).CONCLUSIONS: High TRG/HDL ratio predicted risk of new-onset DM, independently of other traditional risk factors. Furthermore, our findings suggest that advanced hepatic fibrosis, estimated using the fibrosis-4 score, could provide an additional predictor for DM.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "Hepatitis C Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Lipoproteins, HDL", "Liver Cirrhosis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Triglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026766459", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"8369052600": {"Name": "Squillace N.", "AuthorID": "8369052600", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "22035148200": {"Name": "Lapadula G.", "AuthorID": "22035148200", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "57217989504": {"Name": "Bandera A.", "AuthorID": "57217989504", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "35972770200": {"Name": "Gori A.", "AuthorID": "35972770200", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "8652901500": {"Name": "Lorenzini P.", "AuthorID": "8652901500", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "57203678052": {"Name": "Antinori A.", "AuthorID": "57203678052", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "55134188900": {"Name": "Cozzi-Lepri A.", "AuthorID": "55134188900", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "7005846988": {"Name": "Rusconi S.", "AuthorID": "7005846988", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "7004519792": {"Name": "Puoti M.", "AuthorID": "7004519792", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "57201980205": {"Name": "Castagna A.", "AuthorID": "57201980205", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "7006907326": {"Name": "d'Arminio Monforte A.", "AuthorID": "7006907326", "AffiliationID": "60016182", "AffiliationName": "San Paolo University Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
