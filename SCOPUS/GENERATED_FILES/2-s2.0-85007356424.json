This study was undertaken to investigate serum S100A8/A9 level as a biomarker for predicting future relapse in a large cohort of patients with severe AAV. Methods: Serum levels of S100A8/A9 were measured at baseline and months 1, 2, and 6 following treatment initiation in 144 patients in the Rituximab in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis trial (cyclophosphamide/azathioprine versus rituximab [RTX] for induction of remission) in whom complete remission was attained. Results: Patients were divided into 4 groups: proteinase 3 (PR3)\u2013ANCA with relapse (n = 37), PR3-ANCA without relapse (n = 56), myeloperoxidase (MPO)\u2013ANCA with relapse (n = 6), and MPO-ANCA without relapse (n = 45). Serum S100A8/A9 level decreased in all groups during the first 6 months of treatment. The percentage reduction from baseline to month 2 was significantly different between patients who experienced a relapse and those who did not in the PR3-ANCA group (P = 0.046). A significantly higher risk of relapse was associated with an increase in S100A8/A9 level between baseline and month 2 (P = 0.0043) and baseline and month 6 (P = 0.0029). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that patients treated with RTX who had increased levels of S100A8/A9 were at greatest risk of future relapse (P = 0.028). Conclusion: An increase in serum S100A8/A9 level by month 2 or 6 compared to baseline identifies a subgroup of PR3-ANCA patients treated with RTX who are at higher risk of relapse by 18 months. Since RTX is increasingly used for remission induction in PR3-ANCA\u2013positive patients experiencing a relapse, S100A8/A9 level may assist in identifying those patients requiring more intensive or prolonged treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis", "Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic", "Biomarkers", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myeloblastin", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Recurrence", "Rituximab", "Severity of Illness Index", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007356424", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"22635508400": {"Name": "Pepper R.J.", "AuthorID": "22635508400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56346259400": {"Name": "Draibe J.B.", "AuthorID": "56346259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57203209150": {"Name": "Caplin B.", "AuthorID": "57203209150", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55366513900": {"Name": "Salama A.D.", "AuthorID": "55366513900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "University College London Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6701686142": {"Name": "Fervenza F.C.", "AuthorID": "6701686142", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}, "7005264715": {"Name": "Specks U.", "AuthorID": "7005264715", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}, "7202530752": {"Name": "Hoffman G.S.", "AuthorID": "7202530752", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Cleveland Clinic Foundation"}, "7102621970": {"Name": "Langford C.A.", "AuthorID": "7102621970", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Cleveland Clinic Foundation"}, "35395889100": {"Name": "Kallenberg C.G.M.", "AuthorID": "35395889100", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "University of Groningen"}, "56932132500": {"Name": "Monach P.A.", "AuthorID": "56932132500", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Boston University"}, "7004565460": {"Name": "Seo P.", "AuthorID": "7004565460", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University"}, "6603891428": {"Name": "Spiera R.", "AuthorID": "6603891428", "AffiliationID": "60022875", "AffiliationName": "Hospital for Special Surgery"}, "57064064000": {"Name": "William E.", "AuthorID": "57064064000", "AffiliationID": "60113147", "AffiliationName": "Duke University Medical Center"}, "6506358506": {"Name": "Tchao N.K.", "AuthorID": "6506358506", "AffiliationID": "100749962", "AffiliationName": "Immune Tolerance Network"}, "7403061301": {"Name": "Stone J.H.", "AuthorID": "7403061301", "AffiliationID": "60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "7005329470": {"Name": "Merkel P.A.", "AuthorID": "7005329470", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "University of Pennsylvania"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
