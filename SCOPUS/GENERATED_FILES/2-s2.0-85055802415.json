Platelet microparticles, extracellular vesicles released from activated platelets, have recently emerged as a novel regulator of vascular dysfunction. Methods: We studied the effects of platelet microparticles on glomerular endothelial injury in early diabetic nephropathy in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and primary rat glomerular endothelial cells. Isolated platelet microparticles were measured by flow cytometry. Results: Plasma platelet microparticles were significantly increased in diabetic rats, an effect inhibited in aspirin-treated animals. In cultured glomerular endothelial cells, platelet microparticles induced production of reactive oxygen species, decreased nitric oxide levels, inhibited activities of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and SOD, increased permeability of the glomerular endothelium barrier, and reduced thickness of the endothelial surface layer. Conversely, inhibition of platelet microparticles in vivo by aspirin improved glomerular endothelial injury. Further analysis showed that platelet microparticles activated the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway in glomerular endothelial cells; inhibition of them TORC1 pathway by rapamycin or raptor siRNA significantly protected against microparticle-induced glomerular endothelial injury in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, platelet microparticle-derived chemokine ligand 7 (CXCL7) contributed to glomerular endothelial injury, and antagonizing CXCL7 using CXCL7- neutralizing antibody or blocking CXCL7 receptors with a competitive inhibitor of CXCR1 and CXCR2 dramatically attenuated such injury. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate a pathogenic role of plateletmicroparticles in glomerular endothelium dysfunction, and suggest a potential therapeutic target, CXCL7, for treatment of early diabetic nephropathy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Aspirin", "Blood Platelets", "Cell-Derived Microparticles", "Cells, Cultured", "Chemokines, CXC", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Diabetic Nephropathies", "Endothelial Cells", "Kidney Glomerulus", "Male", "Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1", "Platelet Activation", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055802415", "SubjectAreas": [["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"55441743100": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "55441743100", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "7202836854": {"Name": "Ma K.L.", "AuthorID": "7202836854", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "57191958883": {"Name": "Gong Y.X.", "AuthorID": "57191958883", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "57189057234": {"Name": "Wang G.H.", "AuthorID": "57189057234", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "56009891200": {"Name": "Hu Z.B.", "AuthorID": "56009891200", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "56599393300": {"Name": "Liu L.", "AuthorID": "56599393300", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "56599282900": {"Name": "Lu J.", "AuthorID": "56599282900", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "57189051576": {"Name": "Chen P.P.", "AuthorID": "57189051576", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "57195605406": {"Name": "Lu C.C.", "AuthorID": "57195605406", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "26642876800": {"Name": "Liu B.C.", "AuthorID": "26642876800", "AffiliationID": "60005244, 60121958", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nephrology, Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University"}, "57203413669": {"Name": "Ruan X.Z.", "AuthorID": "57203413669", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nephrology, University College London Medical School"}}}
