We used an extended cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) panel to explore differences between \u201ctypical\u201d with \u201catypical\u201d AD and between amnestic, posterior cortical atrophy, logopenic aphasia and frontal variants. We included 97 subjects fulfilling International Working Group-2 research criteria for AD of whom 61 had \u201ctypical\u201d AD and 36 \u201catypical\u201d syndromes, and 30 controls. CSF biomarkers included total tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau), amyloid \u03b21-42, amyloid \u03b2X-38/40/42, YKL-40, neurofilament light (NFL), and amyloid precursor proteins \u03b1 and \u03b2. The typical and atypical groups were matched for age, sex, severity and rate of cognitive decline and had similar biomarker profiles, with the exception of NFL which was higher in the atypical group (p = 0.03). Sub-classifying the atypical group into its constituent clinical syndromes, posterior cortical atrophy was associated with the lowest T-tau [604.4 (436.8\u2013675.8) pg/mL], P-tau (79.8 \u00b1 21.8 pg/L), T-tau/A\u03b21-42 ratio [2.3 (1.4\u20132.6)], A\u03b2X-40/X-42 ratio (22.1 \u00b1 5.8) and rate of cognitive decline [1.9 (0.75\u20134.25) MMSE points/year]. Conversely, the frontal variant group had the highest levels of T-tau [1185.4 (591.7\u20131329.3) pg/mL], P-tau (116.4 \u00b1 45.4 pg/L), T-tau/A\u03b21-42 ratio [5.2 (3.3\u20136.9)] and A\u03b2X-40/X-42 ratio (27.9 \u00b1 7.5), and rate of cognitive decline. Whilst on a group level IWG-2 \u201ctypical\u201d and \u201catypical\u201d AD share similar CSF profiles, which are very different from controls, atypical AD is a heterogeneous entity with evidence for subtle differences in amyloid processing and neurodegeneration between different clinical syndromes. These findings also have practical implications for the interpretation of clinical CSF biomarker results.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "Biomarkers", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "IWG-2"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947865003", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.W.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35557252600": {"Name": "Warren J.D.", "AuthorID": "35557252600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006655431": {"Name": "Mummery C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006655431", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7103182857": {"Name": "Rossor M.N.", "AuthorID": "7103182857", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.J.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.C.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.M.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Box 16 National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56095382000": {"Name": "Slattery C.F.", "AuthorID": "56095382000", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55347741900": {"Name": "Magdalinou N.K.", "AuthorID": "55347741900", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "14029427000": {"Name": "Toombs J.", "AuthorID": "14029427000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "25630004900": {"Name": "Nicholas J.M.", "AuthorID": "25630004900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7004224851": {"Name": "Lunn M.P.", "AuthorID": "7004224851", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroimmunology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
