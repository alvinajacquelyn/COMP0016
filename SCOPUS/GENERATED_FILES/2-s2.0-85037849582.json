However, these therapies are rarely tested in human CSF before clinical trials because of the lack of sensitive methods that enable the measurement of aggregate-induced toxicity at low concentrations. We have developed highly sensitive single vesicle and single-cell-based assays that detect the Ca2+ influx caused by the CSF of individuals affected with AD and healthy controls, and we have found comparable effects for both types of samples. We also show that an extracellular chaperone clusterin; a nanobody specific to the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2); and bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody raised against A\u03b2 could all reduce the Ca2+ influx caused by synthetic A\u03b2 oligomers but are less effective in CSF. These assays could be used to characterize potential therapeutic agents in CSF before clinical trials. Drews et al. develop and implement sensitive in vitro assays to quantitatively measure the Ca2+ influx caused by human cerebrospinal fluid. If a given chaperone, antibody, or nanobody is effective in reducing Ca2+ influx, the authors determine what concentration is needed to prevent Ca2+ influx.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "antibodies", "beta amyloid", "calcium influx", "cerebrospinal fluid", "clusterin", "fluorescence measurements", "neurodegenerative conditions", "oligomers", "single molecule imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amino Acid Sequence", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Astrocytes", "Biological Assay", "Calcium", "Cerebrospinal Fluid", "Clusterin", "Culture Media", "Cytoplasmic Vesicles", "Female", "Humans", "Ion Transport", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Primary Cell Culture", "Protein Aggregates", "Rats", "Single-Domain Antibodies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037849582", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"36542475200": {"Name": "Drews A.", "AuthorID": "36542475200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "41561224100": {"Name": "De S.", "AuthorID": "41561224100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56495561900": {"Name": "Flagmeier P.", "AuthorID": "56495561900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57190954856": {"Name": "Wirthensohn D.", "AuthorID": "57190954856", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57199328763": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "57199328763", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57190681410": {"Name": "Whiten D.", "AuthorID": "57190681410", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "57199328063": {"Name": "Rodrigues M.", "AuthorID": "57199328063", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56623994700": {"Name": "Dobson C.", "AuthorID": "56623994700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7004374922": {"Name": "Klenerman D.", "AuthorID": "7004374922", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "8622097100": {"Name": "Vincke C.", "AuthorID": "8622097100", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "7005810441": {"Name": "Muyldermans S.", "AuthorID": "7005810441", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel"}, "55799312800": {"Name": "Paterson R.", "AuthorID": "55799312800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "56095382000": {"Name": "Slattery C.", "AuthorID": "56095382000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "9739583500": {"Name": "Gandhi S.", "AuthorID": "9739583500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
