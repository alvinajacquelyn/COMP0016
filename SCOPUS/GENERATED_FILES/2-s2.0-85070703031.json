Li2Mn(SO4)2 is synthesized by ball milling of MnSO4\u00b7H2O and Li2SO4\u00b7H2O and characterized using a suite of techniques, in particular, ex situ X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy on the Mn and S K-edges to investigate the electronic and local geometry around the absorbing atoms. The prepared Li2Mn-(SO4)2 electrodes undergo electrochemical cycles to different potential points on the charge\u2212discharge curve and are then extracted from the cells at these points for ex situ structural analysis. Analysis of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (both near and fine structure part of the data) data suggests that there are minimal changes to the oxidation state of Mn and S ions during charge\u2212discharge cycles. However, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis suggests that there are changes in the oxidation state of Mn, which appears to be different from the conclusion drawn from X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This difference in results during cycling can thus be attributed to electrochemical reactions being dominant at the surface of the Li2Mn(SO4)2 particles rather than in the bulk.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070703031", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57200520653": {"Name": "Gupta D.", "AuthorID": "57200520653", "AffiliationID": "60118453, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}, "57195922944": {"Name": "Muthiah A.", "AuthorID": "57195922944", "AffiliationID": "60118936, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Institute@NTU (ERI@N), Nanyang Technological University Research"}, "57203424520": {"Name": "Srinivasan M.", "AuthorID": "57203424520", "AffiliationID": "60118936, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Institute@NTU (ERI@N), Nanyang Technological University Research"}, "56881734500": {"Name": "Dong Z.L.", "AuthorID": "56881734500", "AffiliationID": "60118453, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"}, "57204802147": {"Name": "Do M.P.", "AuthorID": "57204802147", "AffiliationID": "60118800, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Graduate School, Nanyang Technological University"}, "6507953467": {"Name": "Baikie T.", "AuthorID": "6507953467", "AffiliationID": "60118936, 60005510", "AffiliationName": "Energy Research Institute@NTU (ERI@N), Nanyang Technological University Research"}, "7006847733": {"Name": "Sankar G.", "AuthorID": "7006847733", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7102151380": {"Name": "Hyde T.I.", "AuthorID": "7102151380", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre, Blount\u2019s Court"}, "8415845600": {"Name": "Copley M.P.", "AuthorID": "8415845600", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre, Blount\u2019s Court"}, "23491757000": {"Name": "Du Y.", "AuthorID": "23491757000", "AffiliationID": "60011495, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences, A*STAR"}, "56450285200": {"Name": "Xi S.", "AuthorID": "56450285200", "AffiliationID": "60011495, 60025710", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemical and Engineering Sciences, A*STAR"}}}
