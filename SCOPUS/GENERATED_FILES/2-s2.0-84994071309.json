Sources of data Pubmed, Cochrane library and clinical trial registries (clinicaltrials.gov, ISRCTN, UKCRN portfolio database). Areas of agreement Screening and treatment at the age of 4-5 years are cost efficient and clinically effective. Optical treatment (glasses) alone can improve visual acuity, with residual amblyopia treated by part-time occlusion or pharmacological blurring of the better-seeing eye. Treatment after the end of the conventional 'critical period' can improve vision, but in strabismic amblyopia carries a low risk of double vision. Areas of controversy It is not clear whether earlier vision screening would be cost efficient and associated with better outcomes. Optimization of treatment by individualized patching regimes or early start of occlusion, and novel binocular treatment approaches may enhance adherence to treatment, provide better outcomes and shorten treatment duration. Growing points Binocular treatments for amblyopia. Areas timely for developing research Impact of amblyopia on education and quality of life; optimal screening timing and tests; optimal administration of conventional treatments; development of child-friendly, effective and safe binocular treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amblyopia\u2217/diagnosis", "amblyopia\u2217/therapy", "child", "humans", "treatment outcome", "vision screening", "visual acuity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amblyopia", "Child", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Early Diagnosis", "Eyeglasses", "Humans", "Mass Screening", "Prevalence", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994071309", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55281650200": {"Name": "Tailor V.", "AuthorID": "55281650200", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "22950013600": {"Name": "Dahlmann-Noor A.", "AuthorID": "22950013600", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "57191513122": {"Name": "Bossi M.", "AuthorID": "57191513122", "AffiliationID": "60013148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "55658057130": {"Name": "Greenwood J.A.", "AuthorID": "55658057130", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
