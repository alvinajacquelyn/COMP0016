The data were obtained from patients with various kinds of cancers and represented as parenclictic networks, wherein nodes correspond to genes, and edges are weighted according to pairwise variation from control group subjects. We demonstrate that for the 10 types of cancer under study, it is possible to obtain a high performance of binary classification between cancer-positive and negative samples based on network measures. Remarkably, an accuracy as high as 93-99% is achieved with only 12 network topology indices, in a dramatic reduction of complexity from the original 15295 gene methylation levels. Moreover, it was found that the parenclictic networks are scale-free in cancer-negative subjects, and deviate from the power-law node degree distribution in cancer. The node centrality ranking and arising modular structure could provide insights into the systems biology of cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["DNA Methylation", "Humans", "Neoplasms", "Systems Biology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010369546", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57193057587": {"Name": "Karsakov A.", "AuthorID": "57193057587", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics, Centre of Bioinformatics, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "57193071973": {"Name": "Ryblov A.", "AuthorID": "57193071973", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics, Centre of Bioinformatics, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "6603861723": {"Name": "Ivanchenko M.", "AuthorID": "6603861723", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics, Centre of Bioinformatics, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "7103103296": {"Name": "Zaikin A.", "AuthorID": "7103103296", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health and Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55560405000": {"Name": "Bartlett T.", "AuthorID": "55560405000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health and Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "36662508200": {"Name": "Meyerov I.", "AuthorID": "36662508200", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Software and High-Performance Computing, Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}}}
