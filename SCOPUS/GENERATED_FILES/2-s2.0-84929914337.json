It shows the importance of flow past a circular cylinder as a convenient validation test case for new numerical methods and demonstrates the advantages of the immersed boundary method. A new method based on the immersed boundary method to accurately compute fluid\u2013structure interaction and vortex-induced vibrations is then presented and applied. The fluid solver is strongly coupled with the equation of motion through Hamming\u2019s fourth-order predictor\u2013corrector method, which allows computation of the interaction of a fluid with a moving structure. The accuracy, validity and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by a series of validation cases, including flow past stationary and moving cylinders, both prescribed and freely vibrating. The numerical method reproduces fairly well the vibration of an elastically mounted cylinder subjected to a fluid flow. In particular, vibration amplitude as well as vibration frequency are computed quite accurately. In addition, the predicted vortexinduced cylinder vibration lock-in regime is in good agreement with laboratory experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computational mechanics", "hydraulics & hydrodynamics", "mathematical modelling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic excitations", "Equation of motion", "Immersed boundary methods", "Laboratory experiments", "Moving structures", "Vibration amplitude", "Vibration frequency", "Vortex induced vibration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929914337", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"56656485600": {"Name": "Can Kara M.", "AuthorID": "56656485600", "AffiliationID": "60072185", "AffiliationName": "Det Norske Veritas (DNV) USA Inc"}, "6507316700": {"Name": "Stoesser T.", "AuthorID": "6507316700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}, "55877278800": {"Name": "McSherry R.", "AuthorID": "55877278800", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, Cardiff University"}}}
