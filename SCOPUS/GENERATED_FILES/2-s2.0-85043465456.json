Spiro-MeOTAD, the commonly used HTM, is costly and can be easily degraded by heat and moisture, thus offering hindrance to commercialize PSCs. There is dire need to find an alternate inorganic and stable HTM to exploit PSCs with their maximum capability. In this paper, a comprehensive device simulation is used to study various possible parameters that can influence the performance of perovskite solar cell with CuI as HTM. These include the effect of doping density, defect density and thickness of absorber layer, along with the influence of diffusion length of carriers as well as electron affinity of electron transport layer (ETM) and HTM on the performance of PSCs. In addition, hole mobility and doping density of HTM is also investigated. CuI is a p-type inorganic material with low cost and relatively high stability. It is found that concentration of dopant in absorber layer and HTM, the electron affinity of HTM and ETM affect the performance of solar cell minutely, while cell performance improves greatly with the reduction of defect density. Upon optimization of parameters, power conversion efficiency for this device is found to be 21.32%. The result shows that lead-based PSC with CuI as HTM is an efficient system. Enhancing the stability and reduction of defect density are critical factors for future research. These factors can be improved by better fabrication process and proper encapsulation of solar cell.", "AuthorKeywords": ["copper iodide", "defect density", "device simulation", "inorganic HTM", "perovskite solar cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Copper iodide", "Device simulations", "Electron transport layers", "Hole transport materials", "inorganic HTM", "Inorganic materials", "Optimization of parameters", "Power conversion efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043465456", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57201120636": {"Name": "Haider S.", "AuthorID": "57201120636", "AffiliationID": "60078212", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Agriculture Faisalabad"}, "55535882500": {"Name": "Anwar H.", "AuthorID": "55535882500", "AffiliationID": "60078212", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Agriculture Faisalabad"}, "56197503500": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "56197503500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Materials Discovery, University College of London"}}}
