Although the EU is projected to reach this goal, its achievement of objectives under its Emissions Trading System (ETS) may be delayed by carbon leakage, which is defined as a situation in which the reduction in emissions in the ETS region is partially offset by an increase in carbon emissions in the non-ETS regions. We study the interaction between emissions and hydropower availability in order to estimate the magnitude of carbon leakage in the South-East Europe Regional Electricity Market (SEE-REM) via a bottom-up partial equilibrium framework. We find that 6.3% to 40.5% of the emissions reduction achieved in the ETS part of SEE-REM could be leaked to the non-ETS part depending on the price of allowances. Somewhat surprisingly, greater hydropower availability may increase emissions in the ETS part of SEE-REM. However, carbon leakage might be limited by demand response to higher electricity prices in the non-ETS area of SEE-REM. Such carbon leakage can affect both the competitiveness of producers in ETS member countries on the periphery of the ETS and the achievement of EU targets for CO2 emissions reduction. Meanwhile, higher non-ETS electricity prices imply that the current policy can have undesirable outcomes for consumers in non-ETS countries, while non-ETS producers would experience an increase in their profits due to higher power prices as well as exports. The presence of carbon leakage in SEE-REM suggests that current EU policy might become more effective when it is expanded to cover more countries in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon leakage", "CO2 emissions", "Energy Community", "EU ETS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon leakage", "CO2 emissions", "Emissions reduction", "Emissions trading system", "Energy Community", "EU Emissions Trading Systems", "Partial equilibrium", "Regional electricity markets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019947527", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57194384856": {"Name": "Vi\u0161kovi\u0107 V.", "AuthorID": "57194384856", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7201954788": {"Name": "Siddiqui A.S.", "AuthorID": "7201954788", "AffiliationID": "60002970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Decision Sciences, HEC Montr\u00e9al"}, "7601428084": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "7601428084", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Technology Management, University of California"}}}
