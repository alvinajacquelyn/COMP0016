It is well known that the electrostatic contribution to the interaction energy decays exponentially with object separation. Recent measurements reveal that, contrary to the conventional wisdom given by the classic Poisson-Boltzmann theory, the decay length increases with the ion concentration for concentrated electrolytes and can be an order of magnitude larger than the ion diameter in ionic liquids. We derive a simple scaling theory that explains this anomalous dependence of the decay length on the ion concentration. Our theory successfully collapses the decay lengths of a wide class of salts onto a single curve. A novel prediction of our theory is that the decay length increases linearly with the Bjerrum length, which we experimentally verify by surface force measurements. Moreover, we quantitatively relate the measured decay length to classic measurements of the activity coefficient in concentrated electrolytes, thus showing that the measured decay length is indeed a bulk property of the concentrated electrolyte as well as contributing a mechanistic insight into empirical activity coefficients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrolyte solutions", "Electrostatic contributions", "Interaction energies", "Ion concentrations", "Poisson-Boltzmann theory", "Screening lengths", "Soft-matter physics", "Surface force measurement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025455798", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55578168200": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "55578168200", "AffiliationID": "60077572, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "John A.
