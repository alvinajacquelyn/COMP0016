The task of assessing and selecting potential Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) candidate sections, a required part of the process in seeking formalisation of the term, is now being actively pursued. Here, we review the suitability of different stratified palaeoenvironmental settings and facies as potential hosts for a candidate GSSP and auxiliary sections, and the relevant stratigraphical markers for correlation. Published examples are evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses in this respect. A marked upturn in abundance of radioisotopes of 239Pu or 14C, approximately in 1952 and 1954 CE respectively, broadly coincident with a downturn in \u03b413C values, is applicable across most environments. Principal palaeoenvironments examined include: settings associated with accumulations of anthropogenic material, marine anoxic basins, coral reefs, estuaries and deltas, lakes at various latitudes, peat bogs, snow/ice layers, speleothems and trees. Together, many of these geographically diverse palaeoenvironments offer annual/subannual laminae that can be counted and independently dated radiometrically (e.g. by 210Pb). Examples of possible sections offer the possibility of correlation with annual/seasonal resolution. From among such examples, a small number of potentially representative sites require the acquisition of more systematic and comprehensive datasets, with correlation established between sections, to allow selection of a candidate GSSP and auxiliary stratotypes. The assessments in this paper will help find the optimal locations for these sections.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropocene", "Chronostratigraphy", "Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points", "Palaeoenvironments"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042637803", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"7102832190": {"Name": "Waters C.N.", "AuthorID": "7102832190", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Geology and the Environment, University of Leicester"}, "7003744882": {"Name": "Zalasiewicz J.", "AuthorID": "7003744882", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Geology and the Environment, University of Leicester"}, "7410004679": {"Name": "Williams M.", "AuthorID": "7410004679", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Geology and the Environment, University of Leicester"}, "56218127700": {"Name": "Summerhayes C.", "AuthorID": "56218127700", "AffiliationID": "60101625, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge University"}, "7003429458": {"Name": "Fairchild I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003429458", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57203203579": {"Name": "Rose N.L.", "AuthorID": "57203203579", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "6603335688": {"Name": "Loader N.J.", "AuthorID": "6603335688", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Swansea University"}, "56219788700": {"Name": "Shotyk W.", "AuthorID": "56219788700", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renewable Resources, University of Alberta"}, "6602193325": {"Name": "Cearreta A.", "AuthorID": "6602193325", "AffiliationID": "60027856", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Estratigraf\u00eda y Paleontolog\u00eda, Facultad de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda, Universidad del Pa\u00eds Vasco UPV/EHU"}, "7101794885": {"Name": "Head M.J.", "AuthorID": "7101794885", "AffiliationID": "60001343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Brock University"}, "25946569800": {"Name": "Syvitski J.P.M.", "AuthorID": "25946569800", "AffiliationID": "60000221", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado-Boulder Campus"}, "6603595054": {"Name": "Wagreich M.", "AuthorID": "6603595054", "AffiliationID": "60025988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geodynamics and Sedimentology, University of Vienna"}, "6602118780": {"Name": "Barnosky A.D.", "AuthorID": "6602118780", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve, Stanford University"}, "57196890224": {"Name": "An Z.", "AuthorID": "57196890224", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Loess and Quaternary Geology, Institute of Earth Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "6603144313": {"Name": "Leinfelder R.", "AuthorID": "6603144313", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "7103078951": {"Name": "Jeandel C.", "AuthorID": "7103078951", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60024209, 60028993, 60008134, 60017694", "AffiliationName": "LEGOS, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, CNES, CNRS, IRD"}, "35567938800": {"Name": "Ga\u0142uszka A.", "AuthorID": "35567938800", "AffiliationID": "60030302", "AffiliationName": "Geochemistry and the Environment Division, Institute of Chemistry, Jan Kochanowski University"}, "17342425900": {"Name": "Ivar do Sul J.A.", "AuthorID": "17342425900", "AffiliationID": "60072358", "AffiliationName": "Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnem\u00fcende (IOW), Biological Oceanography Section"}, "7003790418": {"Name": "Gradstein F.", "AuthorID": "7003790418", "AffiliationID": "101582032", "AffiliationName": "Natural History Museum"}, "7005295903": {"Name": "Steffen W.", "AuthorID": "7005295903", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "The Australian National University"}, "57214573719": {"Name": "McNeill J.R.", "AuthorID": "57214573719", "AffiliationID": "60023927", "AffiliationName": "Georgetown University"}, "7103353518": {"Name": "Wing S.", "AuthorID": "7103353518", "AffiliationID": "60015033", "AffiliationName": "Smithsonian Institution"}, "23978617900": {"Name": "Poirier C.", "AuthorID": "23978617900", "AffiliationID": "60032215, 60032086, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Morphodynamique Continentale et C\u00f4ti\u00e8re, Universit\u00e9 de Caen Normandie"}, "35603228800": {"Name": "Edgeworth M.", "AuthorID": "35603228800", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Ancient History, University of Leicester"}}}
