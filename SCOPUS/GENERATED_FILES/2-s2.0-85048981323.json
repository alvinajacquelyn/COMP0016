The beam source used in the experiments was a CO2 laser tube with a nominal power of 40 W. The materials used were model Glass beads and a real ceramic material characterized by irregular shape of the particles. Bimodal distributed powders were generated by mixing samples characterized by different narrow particle size distributions. Single layer sintered specimens were obtained with a laser scanning speed of 50 mm/s and 8 W beam. The sintered specimens were studied by means of microphotography and were characterized in terms of bulk density and tensile strength. Results show that the strength of the sintered specimen is significantly dependent upon the amount of fines in the powder mixture, in spite of the limited effects on the specimen thickness and density. In particular, the highest strength of the sintered material are observed with the highest fraction of fines in the originating powder mixture. In order to estimate the value of the forces between particles of different size produced by the sintering action, the model developed by Liu et al. (2017), based on the Rumpf (1958) approach, was purposely adapted. The application of the model revealed that in our process conditions the connection between large and fines particles is significantly weaker than the force between particles of the same size. The model also indicates that the strength of the sintered materials from mixtures can potentially increase up to values significantly higher than those of the materials sintered starting from the unimodal powder components.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Laser sintering", "Morphology analyses", "Powder distribution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bimodal particle size distribution", "Laser scanning speed", "Laser sintering", "Morphology analysis", "Selective laser sintering(SLS)", "Sintered materials", "Sintered specimen", "Specimen thickness"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048981323", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"55770640000": {"Name": "Sofia D.", "AuthorID": "55770640000", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Salerno"}, "6602080548": {"Name": "Barletta D.", "AuthorID": "6602080548", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Salerno"}, "7004488661": {"Name": "Poletto M.", "AuthorID": "7004488661", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Salerno"}, "56971018600": {"Name": "Chirone R.", "AuthorID": "56971018600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35572355100": {"Name": "Lettieri P.", "AuthorID": "35572355100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
