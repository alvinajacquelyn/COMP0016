The West Siberian/Caspian/Nile populations of Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans) regularly overwinter and stop over in Iran, and are considered an economically and culturally important group of birds in the country. Conservation of such migratory birds requires the identification of key threat factors impacting them throughout the flyway. Since documented data on the status and threats facing Anatidae in Iran are very scarce, in this paper, we attempted to determine the general population trends for the 26 Anatidae species in Iran, using annual waterbird census data, and to identify and score the most important threat factors affecting each species, by consulting the top ornithologists and professional birdwatchers in the country by means of a survey. Our results indicate that the most prevalent threats affecting all 26 species are dam construction, water management practices, and hunting. Our results provide the necessary material for Red List assessment of these species at the national level, an important tool for conservation priority setting within Iran and in the flyway.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929748970", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"54914635200": {"Name": "Nourani E.", "AuthorID": "54914635200", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Natural Resources, University of Tehran"}, "12792359400": {"Name": "Kaboli M.", "AuthorID": "12792359400", "AffiliationID": "60022927", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Natural Resources, University of Tehran"}, "24491824300": {"Name": "Collen B.", "AuthorID": "24491824300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}}}
