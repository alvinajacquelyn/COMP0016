A recent systematic review concluded that an increase in skin temperature is predictive of foot ulceration. In-shoe temperature measurement could be a useful tool for studying the etiology of diabetic foot ulceration, we present such a device and preliminary results of its use with 14 healthy participants. Our results show that temperature rise with walking mainly depends on the speed, F(2,190)=3.75, p=0.025, the effect of foot location is mild F(3,1279)=1.69, p=0.169, and there is no difference between the two feet F(1,1279)=0.937, p=0.749. We conclude that such systems are feasible but there are measurement issues to be addressed before they can be utilized further.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetic Foot Ulceration", "In-shoe", "Measurement", "Temperature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diabetic foot", "Foot ulceration", "Global scale", "Skin temperatures", "Systematic Review", "Temperature measurement systems", "Temperature rise"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986879772", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"57191106978": {"Name": "Reddy P.", "AuthorID": "57191106978", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "17134936000": {"Name": "Hodson-Tole E.", "AuthorID": "17134936000", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "7005041731": {"Name": "Reeves N.", "AuthorID": "7005041731", "AffiliationID": "60022046", "AffiliationName": "Manchester Metropolitan University"}, "34978223100": {"Name": "Cooper G.", "AuthorID": "34978223100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}, "7004346861": {"Name": "Weightman A.", "AuthorID": "7004346861", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester"}}}
