Plastic changes induced by bilingualism were reported in young adults in the left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL) and its right counterpart (RIPL) (Mechelli etal., 2004). Moreover, both age of second language (L2) acquisition and L2 proficiency correlated with increased grey matter (GM) in the LIPL/RIPL. However it is unknown whether such findings replicate in older bilinguals. We examined this question in an aging bilingual population from Hong Kong. Results from our Voxel Based Morphometry study show that elderly bilinguals relative to a matched monolingual control group also have increased GM volumes in the inferior parietal lobules underlining the neuroprotective effect of bilingualism. However, unlike younger adults, age of L2 acquisition did not predict GM volumes. Instead, LIPL and RIPL appear differentially sensitive to the effects of L2 proficiency and L2 exposure with LIPL more sensitive to the former and RIPL more sensitive to the latter. Our data also intimate that such differences may be more prominent for speakers of languages that are linguistically closer such as in Cantonese-Mandarin bilinguals as compared to Cantonese-English bilinguals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Bilingualism", "Chinese languages", "Inferior parietal lobule", "Neuroimaging", "Voxel based morphometry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918567208", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"8293683000": {"Name": "Abutalebi J.", "AuthorID": "8293683000", "AffiliationID": "60082964, 60009622", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Cognitive Neurosciences, San Raffaele University and San Raffaele Scientific Institute"}, "6701924212": {"Name": "Weekes B.S.", "AuthorID": "6701924212", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, University of Hong Kong"}, "55550266700": {"Name": "Canini M.", "AuthorID": "55550266700", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "IBFM-CNR (National Research Council)"}, "14420734200": {"Name": "Della Rosa P.A.", "AuthorID": "14420734200", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "IBFM-CNR (National Research Council)"}, "57193517158": {"Name": "Green D.W.", "AuthorID": "57193517158", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Psychology, University College London"}}}
