High-grade glioma (HGG), one of the most lethal human neoplasms, displays genetic modifications of Krebs cycle components as well as electron transport chain (ETC) alterations. Furthermore, the p53 tumor suppressor, which has emerged as a key regulator of mitochondrial respiration at the expense of glycolysis, is genetically inactivated in a large proportion of HGG cases. Therefore, it is becoming evident that genetic modifications can affect cell metabolism in HGG; however, it is currently unclear whether mitochondrial metabolism alterations could vice versa promote genomic instability as a mechanism for neoplastic transformation. Here, we show that, in neural progenitor/stem cells (NPCs), which can act as HGG cell of origin, inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism leads to p53 genetic inactivation. Impairment of respiration via inhibition of complex I or decreased mitochondrial DNA copy number leads to p53 genetic loss and a glycolytic switch. p53 genetic inactivation in ETC-impaired neural stem cells is caused by increased reactive oxygen species and associated oxidative DNA damage. ETC-impaired cells display a marked growth advantage in the presence or absence of oncogenic RAS, and form undifferentiated tumors when transplanted into the mouse brain. Finally, p53 mutations correlated with alterations in ETC subunit composition and activity in primary glioma-initiating neural stem cells. Together, these findings provide previously unidentified insights into the relationship between mitochondria, genomic stability, and tumor suppressive control, with implications for our understanding of brain cancer pathogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain cancer", "Mitochondrial metabolism", "p53"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain Neoplasms", "Cell Transformation, Neoplastic", "Citric Acid Cycle", "DNA Damage", "Electron Transport Chain Complex Proteins", "Glioma", "Glycolysis", "Humans", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred NOD", "Mice, SCID", "Mutation", "Neural Stem Cells", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921755945", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57095773000": {"Name": "Bartesaghi S.", "AuthorID": "57095773000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "37116943400": {"Name": "Graziano V.", "AuthorID": "37116943400", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Sciences, Aging Research Center (Centro Scienze dell'Invecchiamento), University G. d'Annunzio"}, "26640983200": {"Name": "Galavotti S.", "AuthorID": "26640983200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "56494428200": {"Name": "Betts J.", "AuthorID": "56494428200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "56494570300": {"Name": "Saxena J.", "AuthorID": "56494570300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "56495025500": {"Name": "Deli A.", "AuthorID": "56495025500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "6603869171": {"Name": "Salomoni P.", "AuthorID": "6603869171", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Samantha Dickson Brain Cancer Unit, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "57189853776": {"Name": "De Laurenzi V.", "AuthorID": "57189853776", "AffiliationID": "60004638", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Clinical Sciences, Aging Research Center (Centro Scienze dell'Invecchiamento), University G. d'Annunzio"}, "57189008852": {"Name": "Henriquez N.V.", "AuthorID": "57189008852", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006643850": {"Name": "Brandner S.", "AuthorID": "7006643850", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57208071524": {"Name": "Karlsson A.", "AuthorID": "57208071524", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska Institute"}, "55207553500": {"Name": "Martins L.M.", "AuthorID": "55207553500", "AffiliationID": "60023396", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit"}, "14035087400": {"Name": "Capasso M.", "AuthorID": "14035087400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University"}, "7005862533": {"Name": "Nicotera P.", "AuthorID": "7005862533", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Neurodegenerative Erkrankungen"}}}
