Therapy improves the principal manifestations of the condition and, as a consequence, many patients show a modified phenotype which reflects manifestations of their disease that are refractory to treatment. More generally, it is increasingly recognised that information as to how a patient feels and functions [obtained by patient- reported outcome measurements (PROMs)] is critical to any comprehensive evaluation of treatment. A new set of management goals for GD1 in which both trends are reflected is needed. To this end, a modified Delphi procedure among 25 experts was performed. Based on a literature review and with input from patients, 65 potential goals were formulated as statements. Consensus was considered to be reached when \u2265 75% of the participants agreed to include that specific statement in the management goals. There was agreement on 42 statements. In addition to the traditional goals concerning haematological, visceral and bone manifestations, improvement in quality of life, fatigue and social participation, as well as early detection of long-term complications or associated diseases were included. When applying this set of goals in medical practice, the clinical status of the individual patient should be taken into account.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delphi study", "Gaucher disease", "Management goals", "PROMs", "Therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Consensus", "Disease Management", "Europe", "Gaucher Disease", "Humans", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006057007", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"21933572500": {"Name": "Biegstraaten M.", "AuthorID": "21933572500", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division Endocrinology and Metabolism, Academic Medical Center"}, "57192369243": {"Name": "Kiewiet A.I.", "AuthorID": "57192369243", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division Endocrinology and Metabolism, Academic Medical Center"}, "7004900877": {"Name": "Hollak C.E.M.", "AuthorID": "7004900877", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Division Endocrinology and Metabolism, Academic Medical Center"}, "56577375300": {"Name": "Cox T.M.", "AuthorID": "56577375300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "7003564362": {"Name": "Belmatoug N.", "AuthorID": "7003564362", "AffiliationID": "113150000", "AffiliationName": "Referral Center for Lysosomal Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Paris Nord Val de Seine"}, "7404267974": {"Name": "Berger M.G.", "AuthorID": "7404267974", "AffiliationID": "60007548, 60138276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Haematology, Hospital Estaing, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand; EA CREaT 7283, Auvergne University"}, "6504014353": {"Name": "Collin-Histed T.", "AuthorID": "6504014353", "AffiliationID": "113955612", "AffiliationName": "European Gaucher Alliance"}, "55863954100": {"Name": "Vom Dahl S.", "AuthorID": "55863954100", "AffiliationID": "60072305", "AffiliationName": "Klinik f\u00fcr Gastroenterologie, Hepatologie und Infektiologie, Universit\u00e4tsklinikum D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "15755169600": {"Name": "Di Rocco M.", "AuthorID": "15755169600", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Unit of Rare Diseases, Giannina Gaslini Institute"}, "57189444693": {"Name": "Fraga C.", "AuthorID": "57189444693", "AffiliationID": "116723687", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, HDES Hospital"}, "6701332902": {"Name": "Giona F.", "AuthorID": "6701332902", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University"}, "7007060971": {"Name": "Giraldo P.", "AuthorID": "7007060971", "AffiliationID": "60120576", "AffiliationName": "Translational Research Unit, IIS Arag\u00f3n, CIBERER"}, "23496822800": {"Name": "Hasanhodzic M.", "AuthorID": "23496822800", "AffiliationID": "112315231", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, Metabolic Diseases and Genetics, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Children's hospital"}, "55186237200": {"Name": "Hughes D.A.", "AuthorID": "55186237200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102956875": {"Name": "Iversen P.O.", "AuthorID": "7102956875", "AffiliationID": "60010348, 60105037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition, IMB, University of Oslo, Department of Hematology, Oslo University Hospital"}, "7006788246": {"Name": "Lukina E.", "AuthorID": "7006788246", "AffiliationID": "60073364", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orphan Diseases, National Research Center for Hematology"}, "6602207054": {"Name": "Machaczka M.", "AuthorID": "6602207054", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Hematology Center Karolinska, Department of Medicine at Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "6508118490": {"Name": "Marinakis T.", "AuthorID": "6508118490", "AffiliationID": "60031193", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Haematology, General Hospital of Athens \u201cG.
