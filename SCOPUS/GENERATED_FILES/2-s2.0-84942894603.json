Various deletions, gains, mutations and rearrangements of PAX5 comprised 45%, 12%, 29% and 14%, respectively, of the abnormalities found. 28% of patients showed more than one abnormality of the gene, implying bi-allelic impairment of PAX5. Novel PAX5-RHOXF2, PAX5-ELK3 and PAX5-CBFA2T2 rearrangements, which lead to aberrant expression of PAX5, were also identified. PAX5 rearrangements demonstrated a complex mechanism of formation including concurrent duplications/deletions of PAX5 and its partner genes. Finally, the splice variant c.1013-2A>G, seen in two patients with loss of one PAX5 allele, was confirmed to be germ-line in one patient and somatic in the other. PAX5 alterations were also found to be clinically associated with a higher white blood cell count (P = 0\u00b7015). These findings contribute to the knowledge of PAX5 alterations and their role in the pathogenesis of pre-B ALL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia", "Deletions", "Mutations", "PAX5", "Rearrangements"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942894603", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"24333309400": {"Name": "Stasevich I.", "AuthorID": "24333309400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer (DBC), University College London-Institute of Child Health"}, "55641886800": {"Name": "Inglott S.", "AuthorID": "55641886800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Cellular and Molecular Diagnostic Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "54390768800": {"Name": "Austin N.", "AuthorID": "54390768800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Cellular and Molecular Diagnostic Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "8774952100": {"Name": "Chatters S.", "AuthorID": "8774952100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Cellular and Molecular Diagnostic Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "20933841700": {"Name": "Chalker J.", "AuthorID": "20933841700", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Cellular and Molecular Diagnostic Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56884314000": {"Name": "Addy D.", "AuthorID": "56884314000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Cellular and Molecular Diagnostic Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56884395100": {"Name": "Dryden C.", "AuthorID": "56884395100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology Cellular and Molecular Diagnostic Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7003732797": {"Name": "Kempski H.", "AuthorID": "7003732797", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer (DBC), University College London-Institute of Child Health"}, "8081160000": {"Name": "Williams O.", "AuthorID": "8081160000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer (DBC), University College London-Institute of Child Health"}, "6602785389": {"Name": "Ancliff P.", "AuthorID": "6602785389", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7202318605": {"Name": "Ford A.", "AuthorID": "7202318605", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Evolution and Cancer, The Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
