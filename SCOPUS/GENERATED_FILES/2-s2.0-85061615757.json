This model is therefore invalid qua normative standard. We advise against generally forsaking optimality and argue that a biologically constrained definition of optimality could serve as an important driver for scientific progress.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Brain", "Decision Making"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061615757", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"55542790700": {"Name": "Moran R.", "AuthorID": "55542790700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "36624399500": {"Name": "Tsetsos K.", "AuthorID": "36624399500", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysiology and Pathophysiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}}}
