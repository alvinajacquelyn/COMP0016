However, a merely metal-based interconnect reaches performance bound with the relentless technology scaling. Especially, it displayed a bottleneck to meet the communication bandwidth demand for multicasting. This paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, which improves the on-chip communication bandwidth significantly using mixed wires and surface wave interconnects (SWI) fabrics. In particular, the bandwidth of multicasting can be drastically improved. We introduce a decentralized arbitration method to fully utilize the slack-time scheduling with deadlock-free flow control. Evaluation results, based on a cycle-accurate and hardware-based simulation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and methods. Compared to a wire-based NoC, the mixed fabric approach can achieve an improvement in power reduction and communication speed up to 63% and 12X, respectively. These results are achieved with almost negligible hardware overheads. This new paradigm efficiently addresses the emerged challenges for on-chip communications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Communication bandwidth", "Communication speed", "Evaluation results", "Hardware overheads", "Hybrid architectures", "Network-on-chip(NoC)", "On chip communication", "Proposed architectures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945907473", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"55537453400": {"Name": "Karkar A.", "AuthorID": "55537453400", "AffiliationID": "60071160", "AffiliationName": "IT Research Centre, University of Kufa"}, "7202347876": {"Name": "Yakovlev A.", "AuthorID": "7202347876", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.F.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, UCL"}, "15769258700": {"Name": "Mak T.", "AuthorID": "15769258700", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong"}}}
