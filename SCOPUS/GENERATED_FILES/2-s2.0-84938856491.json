Recent light field imaging systems provide new see-through capabilities through synthetic aperture imaging (SAI) to overcome the occlusion problem. Existing synthetic aperture imaging methods, however, emulate focusing at a specific depth layer, but are incapable of producing an all-in-focus see-through image. Alternative in-painting algorithms can generate visually-plausible results, but cannot guarantee the correctness of the results. In this paper, we present a novel depth-free all-in-focus SAI technique based on light field visibility analysis. Specifically, we partition the scene into multiple visibility layers to directly deal with layer-wise occlusion and apply an optimization framework to propagate the visibility information between multiple layers. On each layer, visibility and optimal focus depth estimation is formulated as a multiple-label energy minimization problem. The layer-wise energy integrates all of the visibility masks from its previous layers, multi-view intensity consistency and depth smoothness constraint together. We compare our method with state-of-the-art solutions, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["All-in-focus synthetic aperture imaging", "Camera array", "Multiple-layer visibility propagation", "Occluded object imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Camera arrays", "Computer vision applications", "Energy minimization problem", "Multiple layers", "Occluded objects", "Optimization framework", "Smoothness constraints", "Synthetic aperture imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938856491", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56531096200": {"Name": "Yang T.", "AuthorID": "56531096200", "AffiliationID": "60003977", "AffiliationName": "ShaanXi Provincial Key Lab of Speech and Image Information Processing, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University"}, "56075029000": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56075029000", "AffiliationID": "60003977", "AffiliationName": "ShaanXi Provincial Key Lab of Speech and Image Information Processing, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University"}, "36088377500": {"Name": "Tong X.", "AuthorID": "36088377500", "AffiliationID": "60003977", "AffiliationName": "ShaanXi Provincial Key Lab of Speech and Image Information Processing, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University"}, "55351990600": {"Name": "Ran L.", "AuthorID": "55351990600", "AffiliationID": "60003977", "AffiliationName": "ShaanXi Provincial Key Lab of Speech and Image Information Processing, School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University"}, "55885380300": {"Name": "Li J.", "AuthorID": "55885380300", "AffiliationID": "60025578", "AffiliationName": "School of Telecommunications Engineering, Xidian University"}, "8569656400": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "8569656400", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Delaware"}, "55947849000": {"Name": "Ma W.", "AuthorID": "55947849000", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer and Information Science, University of Delaware"}, "36899743400": {"Name": "Yu R.", "AuthorID": "36899743400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
