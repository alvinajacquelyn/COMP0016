We hypothesize that RIP140 may also affect A\u03b2 generation because it modulates the activity of transcription factors previously implicated in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3). We found that the levels of RIP140 are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) postmortem brains compared with healthy controls. In addition, in situ hybridization experiments revealed that RIP140 expression is enriched in the same brain areas involved in AD pathology, such as cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, we provide evidence using cell lines and genetically modified mice that RIP140 is able to modulate the transcription of certain genes involved in AD pathology, such as \u03b2-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and GSK3. Consequently, we found that RIP140 overexpression reduced the generation of A\u03b2 in a neuroblastoma cell line by decreasing the transcription of \u03b2-APP cleaving enzyme via a PPAR\u03b3\u2013dependent mechanism. The results of this study therefore provide molecular insights into common signaling pathways linking metabolic disease with AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "A\u03b2", "BACE1", "GSK3", "PPAR\u03b3", "RIP140"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor", "Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases", "Animals", "Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases", "Brain", "Cells, Cultured", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nuclear Proteins", "PPAR gamma", "Signal Transduction", "Transcription, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985995988", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"55505214800": {"Name": "Blondrath K.", "AuthorID": "55505214800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "43161109200": {"Name": "Katsouri L.", "AuthorID": "43161109200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57190812136": {"Name": "Ries M.", "AuthorID": "57190812136", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57204295013": {"Name": "Sastre M.", "AuthorID": "57204295013", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7101741022": {"Name": "Steel J.", "AuthorID": "7101741022", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "57209814225": {"Name": "Parker M.", "AuthorID": "57209814225", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Department of Surgery & Cancer, Imperial College London"}, "7102667594": {"Name": "Christian M.", "AuthorID": "7102667594", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Metabolic and Vascular Health, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}}}
