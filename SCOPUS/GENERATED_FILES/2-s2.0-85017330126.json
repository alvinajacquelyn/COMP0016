Published on behalf of the American Heart Association, Inc., by Wiley Blackwell.Background: Biomarkers are frequently used to estimate infarct size (IS) as an endpoint in experimental and clinical studies. Here, we prospectively studied the impact of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy (LVH) on biomarker release in clinical and experimental myocardial infarction (MI). Methods and Results--ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients (n=140) were monitored for total creatine kinase (CK) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over 72 hours postinfarction and were examined by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) at 1 week and 6 months postinfarction. MI was generated in pigs with induced LVH (n=10) and in sham-operated pigs (n=8), and serial total CK and cTnI measurements were performed and CMR scans conducted at 7 days postinfarction. Regression analysis was used to study the influence of LVH on total CK and cTnI release and IS estimated by CMR (gold standard). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to study the discriminatory capacity of the area under the curve (AUC) of cTnI and total CK in predicting LV dysfunction. Cardiomyocyte cTnI expression was quantified in myocardial sections from LVH and sham-operated pigs. In both the clinical and experimental studies, LVH was associated with significantly higher peak and AUC of cTnI, but not with differences in total CK. ROC curves showed that the discriminatory capacity of AUC of cTnI to predict LV dysfunction was significantly worse for patients with LVH. LVH did not affect the capacity of total CK to estimate IS or LV dysfunction. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed significantly higher cTnI content in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Conclusions--Peak and AUC of cTnI both significantly overestimate IS in the presence of LVH, owing to the higher troponin content per cardiomyocyte. In the setting of LVH, cTnI release during STEMI poorly predicts postinfarction LV dysfunction. LV mass should be taken into consideration when IS or LV function are estimated by troponin release.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Creatine kinase", "Hypertrophy", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Myocardial infarction", "Troponin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Animals", "Area Under Curve", "Biomarkers", "Creatine Kinase, MB Form", "Disease Models, Animal", "Electrocardiography", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Myocardial Infarction", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Regression Analysis", "ROC Curve", "Severity of Illness Index", "Sus scrofa", "Swine", "Translational Medical Research", "Troponin I", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017330126", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"26657321100": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Jim\u00e9nez R.", "AuthorID": "26657321100", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Cl\u00ednico San Carlos"}, "6603189664": {"Name": "Mart\u00ednez-Mart\u00ednez S.", "AuthorID": "6603189664", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC)"}, "57193882398": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Maderuelo M.", "AuthorID": "57193882398", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC)"}, "36057137200": {"Name": "Nuno-Ayala M.", "AuthorID": "36057137200", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC)"}, "35955892300": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Ruiz J.", "AuthorID": "35955892300", "AffiliationID": "60016862", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias"}, "24724070000": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-\u00c1lvarez A.", "AuthorID": "24724070000", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinic"}, "57210010334": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Friera L.", "AuthorID": "57210010334", "AffiliationID": "112688327", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Montepr\u00edncipe"}, "34880524600": {"Name": "Pizarro T.", "AuthorID": "34880524600", "AffiliationID": "60028356", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario Quir\u00f3n Madrid UEM"}, "55203203600": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Prieto J.", "AuthorID": "55203203600", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC)"}, "6508329308": {"Name": "Sanz-Rosa D.", "AuthorID": "6508329308", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC)"}, "56492922000": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-Martin G.", "AuthorID": "56492922000", "AffiliationID": "60011100", "AffiliationName": "Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares Carlos III (CNIC)"}, "7202675508": {"Name": "Fuster V.", "AuthorID": "7202675508", "AffiliationID": "60012981", "AffiliationName": "The Zena and Michael A.
