Gene therapy offers the potential for benefit. Sources of data: Pubmed and clinicaltrials.gov. Areas of agreement: Gene therapy can improve vision in RPE65-associated Leber Congenital Amaurosis (RPE65-LCA). Potential benefit depends on efficient gene transfer and is limited by the extent of retinal degeneration. Areas of controversy: The magnitude of vision improvement from RPE65- LCA gene therapy is suboptimal, and its durability may be limited by progressive retinal degeneration. Growing points: The safety and potential benefit of gene therapy for inherited and acquired retinal diseases is being explored in a rapidly expanding number of trials. Areas timely for developing research: Developments in vector design and delivery will enable greater efficiency and safety of gene transfer. Optimization of trial design will accelerate reliable assessment of outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gene therapy", "retina", "retinal diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Trials as Topic", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Leber Congenital Amaurosis", "Retinal Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048942903", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"37021661300": {"Name": "Kumaran N.", "AuthorID": "37021661300", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at Moofields Eye Hospital and UCL"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Michaelides M.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at Moofields Eye Hospital and UCL"}, "57203012241": {"Name": "Smith A.J.", "AuthorID": "57203012241", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at Moofields Eye Hospital and UCL"}, "7201812544": {"Name": "Ali R.R.", "AuthorID": "7201812544", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at Moofields Eye Hospital and UCL"}, "7005169657": {"Name": "Bainbridge J.W.B.", "AuthorID": "7005169657", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology at Moofields Eye Hospital and UCL"}}}
