Recent distance ladder determinations of the Hubble constant H 0 disagree at about the 3.5\u03c3 level with the value determined from Planck measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) assuming a \u03b4 CDM 1 cosmology. This discrepancy has prompted speculation that new physics might be required beyond that assumed in the \u03b4 CDM model. In this paper, we apply the inverse distance ladder to fit a parametric form of H(z) to baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Type Ia supernova (SNe) data together with priors on the sound horizon at the end of the radiation drag epoch, r d. We apply priors on r d, based on inferences from either Planck or the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), and demonstrate that these values are consistent with CMB-independent determination of r d derived from measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance, BAO, and supernova data assuming the \u03b4 CDM cosmology. The H(z) constraints that we derive are independent of detailed physics within the dark sector at low redshifts, relying only on the validity of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric of General Relativity. For each assumed prior on r d, we find consistency with the inferred value of H 0 and the Planck \u03b4 CDM value and corresponding tension with the distance ladder estimate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cosmological parameters", "cosmology: observations", "distance scale", "large-scale structure of Universe"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062268554", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190313600": {"Name": "Lemos P.", "AuthorID": "57190313600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57207195000": {"Name": "Lee E.", "AuthorID": "57207195000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester"}, "7005694698": {"Name": "Efstathiou G.", "AuthorID": "7005694698", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Cosmology Cambridge, Institute of Astronomy"}, "6701556321": {"Name": "Gratton S.", "AuthorID": "6701556321", "AffiliationID": "60019598, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Cosmology Cambridge, Institute of Astronomy"}}}
