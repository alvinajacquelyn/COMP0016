In the human body, the endothelium of blood vessels exhibits characteristics that inhibit such processes. As such it is not surprising that research in tissue engineering is directed towards replicating the functionality of the natural endothelium in cardiovascular grafts. This can be done either by seeding the endothelium within the lumen of the grafts prior to implantation or by designing the graft such that in situ endothelialisation takes place after implantation. Due to certain difficulties identified with in vitro endothelialisation, in situ endothelialisation, which will be the focus of this article, has garnered interest in the last years. To promote in situ endothelialisation, the following aspects can be taken into account: (1) Endothelial progenital cell mobilization, adhesion and proliferation; (2) Regulating differentiation of progenitor cells to mature endothelium; (3) Preventing thrombogenesis and inflammation during endothelialisation. This article aims to review and compile recent developments to promote the in situ endothelialisation of cardiovascular grafts and subsequently improve their patency, which can also have widespread implications in the field of tissue engineering.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioengineered stents", "Cardiology", "Endothelial progenitor cells", "Endothelialization", "Nanotechnology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Cell Adhesion", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Endothelial Progenitor Cells", "Endothelium, Vascular", "Humans", "Surface Properties", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920074753", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57220535487": {"Name": "Goh E.T.", "AuthorID": "57220535487", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London (UCL)"}, "56464649400": {"Name": "Wong E.", "AuthorID": "56464649400", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Medical School, University College London (UCL)"}, "55577521900": {"Name": "Farhatnia Y.", "AuthorID": "55577521900", "AffiliationID": "60176023, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine, Research Department of Nanotechnology, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London (UCL)"}, "36931163300": {"Name": "Tan A.", "AuthorID": "36931163300", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60012708", "AffiliationName": "Biomaterials and Advanced Drug Delivery Laboratory, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University"}, "7005344804": {"Name": "Seifalian A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005344804", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "University Department of Surgery, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Hospital"}}}
