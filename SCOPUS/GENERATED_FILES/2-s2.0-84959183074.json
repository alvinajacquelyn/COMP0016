Here, we have developed a receptor-targeted liposome-peptide-siRNA nanoparticle as a non-viral delivery system for MRTF-B siRNA in conjunctival fibrosis. Using 50 nM siRNA, the MRTF-B gene was efficiently silenced by 76% and 72% with LYR and LER nanoparticles, respectively. The silencing efficiency was low when non-targeting peptides or siRNA alone or liposome-siRNA alone were used. LYR and LER nanoparticles also showed higher silencing efficiency than PEGylated LYR-P and LER-P nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were not cytotoxic using different liposomes, targeting peptides, and 50 nM siRNA. Three-dimensional fibroblast-populated collagen matrices were also used as a functional assay to measure contraction in vitro, and showed that MRTF-B LYR nanoparticles completely blocked matrix contraction after a single transfection treatment. In conclusion, this is the first study to develop and show that receptor-targeted liposome-peptide-siRNA nanoparticles represent an efficient and safe non-viral siRNA delivery system that could be used to prevent fibrosis after glaucoma filtration surgery and other contractile scarring conditions in the eye.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Blotting, Western", "Cells, Cultured", "Drug Carriers", "Eye Diseases", "Fibroblasts", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Liposomes", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Nanoparticles", "Peptides", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "RNA Interference", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959183074", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57142449100": {"Name": "Yu-Wai-Man C.", "AuthorID": "57142449100", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "6603243611": {"Name": "Tagalakis A.D.", "AuthorID": "6603243611", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Gene Therapy of Childhood Disease, UCL, Institute of Child Health"}, "6602584168": {"Name": "Manunta M.D.", "AuthorID": "6602584168", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Gene Therapy of Childhood Disease, UCL, Institute of Child Health"}, "57203103916": {"Name": "Hart S.L.", "AuthorID": "57203103916", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Gene Therapy of Childhood Disease, UCL, Institute of Child Health"}}}
