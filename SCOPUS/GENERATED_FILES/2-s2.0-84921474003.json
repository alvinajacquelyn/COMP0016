Study design Population-based prospective cohort study of 1130 LMPT and 1255 term-born infants. Parents completed the M-CHAT questionnaire at 2-years corrected age. Parents of infants with positive questionnaire screens were followed up with a telephone interview to clarify failed items. The M-CHAT questionnaire was re-scored, and infants were classified as true or false positives. Neurosensory, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes were assessed using parent report. Results Parents of 634 (57%) LMPT and 761 (62%) term-born infants completed the M-CHAT questionnaire. LMPT infants had significantly higher risk of a positive questionnaire screen compared with controls (14.5% vs 9.2%; relative risk [RR] 1.58; 95% CI 1.18, 2.11). After follow-up, significantly more LMPT infants than controls had a true positive screen (2.4% vs 0.5%; RR 4.52; 1.51, 13.56). This remained significant after excluding infants with neurosensory impairments (2.0% vs 0.5%; RR 3.67; 1.19, 11.3). Conclusions LMPT infants are at significantly increased risk for positive autistic screen. An M-CHAT follow-up interview is essential as screening for autism spectrum disorders is especially confounded in preterm populations. Infants with false positive screens are at risk for cognitive and behavioral problems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Autistic Disorder", "Checklist", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Infant, Premature, Diseases", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Questionnaires", "Risk Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921474003", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"56267570200": {"Name": "Guy A.", "AuthorID": "56267570200", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Warwick"}, "54394139000": {"Name": "Seaton S.", "AuthorID": "54394139000", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7103365711": {"Name": "Boyle E.", "AuthorID": "7103365711", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "20733798900": {"Name": "Draper E.", "AuthorID": "20733798900", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7202713033": {"Name": "Field D.", "AuthorID": "7202713033", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "57202150980": {"Name": "Manktelow B.", "AuthorID": "57202150980", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "8624238200": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "8624238200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7406331158": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331158", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Academic Neonatology, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
