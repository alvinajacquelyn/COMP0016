This study aims to examine the prevalence of alcohol consumption and the association between alcohol consumption and age of onset with health and social consequences among adolescents presenting to emergency departments (EDs). Methods Consecutive attenders (n = 5,576) aged 10\u201317 years at 10 EDs were included. Information was collected on general health and functioning, quality of life, alcohol use, and alcohol-related health and social consequences. Results Nearly 40% of adolescents reported the consumption of alcohol that was more than a sip in their lifetime. Age of the first alcohol consumption before the age of 15 years was associated with tobacco use (p <.001), lower quality of life (p =.003), and evidence of an alcohol use disorder (p =.002). It was also associated with general social functioning (problems with conduct p =.001 and hyperactivity p =.001) and alcohol-related health and social consequences (accident p =.046, problems with a parent p =.017, school p =.0117, or police p =.012). Conclusions Rates of alcohol consumption in adolescents presenting to the ED were similar to those reported in schools in England and globally. Associations of alcohol consumption and earlier onset of drinking with poorer health and social functioning were observed. The ED can offer an opportunity for the identification of hazardous alcohol use in adolescents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescents", "Alcohol use", "Emergency department", "Health", "Social functioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Age of Onset", "Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholism", "Child", "Depression", "Emergency Service, Hospital", "England", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Prevalence", "Quality of Life", "Regression Analysis", "Risk Factors", "Sexual Behavior", "Social Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009486480", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35236939500": {"Name": "Donoghue K.", "AuthorID": "35236939500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57189747151": {"Name": "Rose H.", "AuthorID": "57189747151", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "50061107600": {"Name": "Boniface S.", "AuthorID": "50061107600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "8676467300": {"Name": "Deluca P.", "AuthorID": "8676467300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "24071392500": {"Name": "Phillips T.", "AuthorID": "24071392500", "AffiliationID": "60172583", "AffiliationName": "Humber NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102963151": {"Name": "Strang J.", "AuthorID": "7102963151", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7102876511": {"Name": "Drummond C.", "AuthorID": "7102876511", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "National Addiction Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "54996566500": {"Name": "Coulton S.", "AuthorID": "54996566500", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Services Studies, University of Kent"}, "8634802500": {"Name": "Alam M.F.", "AuthorID": "8634802500", "AffiliationID": "60072749", "AffiliationName": "Public Health Department, College of Health Sciences, Qatar University"}, "6603581876": {"Name": "Gilvarry E.", "AuthorID": "6603581876", "AffiliationID": "60105394", "AffiliationName": "Northumberland Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004071168": {"Name": "Kaner E.", "AuthorID": "7004071168", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "57192957723": {"Name": "Lynch E.", "AuthorID": "57192957723", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "37117453300": {"Name": "McGovern R.", "AuthorID": "37117453300", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University"}, "6701390361": {"Name": "Maconochie I.", "AuthorID": "6701390361", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Emergency Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "57203250603": {"Name": "McArdle P.", "AuthorID": "57203250603", "AffiliationID": "60017826", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics and Policy Research Unit, University of South Wales"}, "7801384993": {"Name": "Newbury-Birch D.", "AuthorID": "7801384993", "AffiliationID": "60025655", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Care, Teesside University"}, "7102332492": {"Name": "Patton R.", "AuthorID": "7102332492", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Surrey"}, "7403135951": {"Name": "Phillips C.J.", "AuthorID": "7403135951", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "Swansea Centre for Health Economics, College of Human and Health Sciences, Swansea University"}, "7201981270": {"Name": "Russell I.", "AuthorID": "7201981270", "AffiliationID": "60170471", "AffiliationName": "Swansea University Medical School"}}}
