Two seasons of fieldwork undertaken in 2013 revealed a landscape of shallow, short-lived sites at odds with the large permanent towns described by historical accounts and oral traditions. This article argues that the key to reconciling these two sets of evidence lies in a very particular settlement pattern \u2014 one of \u2018shifting sedentism\u2019 \u2014 by which villages and towns regularly shifted a few hundred metres, while keeping the name, identity, and institutions of the community intact. Combining data from ethnographic observations, written historical sources, oral traditions, surface survey and excavation, the paper reviews the importance of shifting sedentism in the Upper Casamance's history, as well as its wider archaeological implications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Casamance", "Fulaadu", "Kaabu", "mobility", "shifting sedentism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85002412747", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57192252255": {"Name": "Donnay S.", "AuthorID": "57192252255", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
