Interest in single-stage exchange for PJI is rising and we assess evidence from the last 5 years related to this treatment strategy. Recent Findings: Only five series for total knee replacement and ten series for total hip replacement have been reported in the last five years. More review articles and opinion pieces have been written. Reinfection rates in these recent studies range from 0 to 65%, but a meta-analysis and systematic review of all studies showed a reinfection rate of 7.6% (95% CI 3.4\u201313.1) and 8.8% (95% CI 7.2\u201310.6) for single-stage and two-stage revisions respectively. There is emerging evidence to support single-stage revision in the setting of significant bony deficiency and atypical PJIs such as fungal infections. Summary: Prospective randomised studies are recruiting and are necessary to guide the direction of single-stage revision selection criteria. The onus of surgical excellence in mechanical removal of implants, necrotic tissue, and biofilms lies with the arthroplasty surgeon and must remain the cornerstone of treatment. Single-stage revision may be considered the first-line treatment for all PJIs unless the organism is unknown, the patient is systemically septic, or there is a poor tissue envelope.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Prosthetic joint infection", "Revision hip replacement", "Revision knee replacement", "Single-stage revision"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049616301", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"26028683200": {"Name": "Rowan F.E.", "AuthorID": "26028683200", "AffiliationID": "106619498", "AffiliationName": "The Princess Grace Hospital"}, "57197712080": {"Name": "Donaldson M.J.", "AuthorID": "57197712080", "AffiliationID": "106619498", "AffiliationName": "The Princess Grace Hospital"}, "56504959400": {"Name": "Pietrzak J.R.", "AuthorID": "56504959400", "AffiliationID": "106619498", "AffiliationName": "The Princess Grace Hospital"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "106619498", "AffiliationName": "The Princess Grace Hospital"}}}
