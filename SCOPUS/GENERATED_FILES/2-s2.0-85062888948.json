The reactor consisted of gas and liquid channels (75 mm (L) \u00d7 3 mm (W) \u00d7 1 mm (D)), separated by a 0.07 mm thick semipermeable Teflon AF-2400 flat membrane, which allowed continuous supply of oxygen during the reaction and simultaneously avoided direct mixing of gaseous oxygen with organic reactants. A catalyst stability test was first carried out, and the experimental data obtained were used to estimate the kinetics of benzyl alcohol oxidation with a 2D reactor model. Using these kinetics, predictions from the 2D reactor model agreed well with the experimental data obtained at different liquid flow rates and oxygen pressures. The mass transfer and catalytic reaction in the membrane microchannel reactor were then theoretically studied by changing the membrane thickness, the liquid channel depth, and the reaction rate coefficient. Oxygen transverse mass transport in the catalyst bed was found to be the controlling process for the system investigated, and decreasing the liquid channel depth is suggested to improve the oxygen supply and enhance the benzyl alcohol conversion in the membrane reactor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol aerobic oxidation", "Membrane reactor modelling", "Ruthenium catalyst", "Teflon AF-2400 membrane"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerobic oxidations", "Benzyl alcohol conversion", "Benzyl alcohol oxidation", "Membrane reactor modelling", "Micro channel reactors", "Reaction rate coefficients", "Ruthenium catalysts", "Teflon AF"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062888948", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"55073511800": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "55073511800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "9241458400": {"Name": "Cao E.", "AuthorID": "9241458400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35558454600": {"Name": "Constantinou A.", "AuthorID": "35558454600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "19638904700": {"Name": "Kuhn S.", "AuthorID": "19638904700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003522751": {"Name": "Gavriilidis A.", "AuthorID": "7003522751", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "35334000300": {"Name": "Ellis P.", "AuthorID": "35334000300", "AffiliationID": "60027782", "AffiliationName": "Johnson Matthey Technology Centre, Blount's Court, Sonning Common"}}}
