Dis.", "Volume": "75", "Issue": 4, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 696, "PageEnd": 701, "CitedBy": 72, "DOI": "10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-206691", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84930014705&origin=inward", "Abstract": "Objectives: The diagnosis of inclusion body myositis (IBM) can be challenging as it can be difficult to clinically distinguish from other forms of myositis, particularly polymyositis (PM). Recent studies have shown frequent presence of autoantibodies directed against cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1A (cN-1A) in patients with IBM. We therefore, examined the autoantigenicity and disease specificity of major epitopes of cN-1A in patients with sporadic IBM compared with healthy and disease controls. Methods: Serum samples obtained from patients with IBM (n=238), PM and dermatomyositis (DM) (n=185), other autoimmune diseases (n=246), other neuromuscular diseases (n=93) and healthy controls (n=35) were analysed for the presence of autoantibodies using immunodominant cN-1A peptide ELISAs. Results: Autoantibodies directed against major epitopes of cN-1A were frequent in patients with IBM (37%) but not in PM, DM or non-autoimmune neuromuscular diseases (<5%). Anti-cN-1A reactivity was also observed in some other autoimmune diseases, particularly Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SjS; 36%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 20%). Conclusions: In summary, we found frequent anti-cN-1A autoantibodies in sera from patients with IBM. Heterogeneity in reactivity with the three immunodominant epitopes indicates that serological assays should not be limited to a distinct epitope region. The similar reactivities observed for SjS and SLE demonstrate the need to further investigate whether distinct IBM-specific epitopes exist.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["5'-Nucleotidase", "Adult", "Aged", "Arthritis, Rheumatoid", "Autoantibodies", "Autoimmune Diseases", "Case-Control Studies", "Dermatomyositis", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Female", "Humans", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Myositis, Inclusion Body", "Neuromuscular Diseases", "Polymyositis", "ROC Curve", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Sjogren's Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930014705", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"37026202400": {"Name": "Herbert M.", "AuthorID": "37026202400", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "16205800400": {"Name": "Stammen-Vogelzangs J.", "AuthorID": "16205800400", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "7007034645": {"Name": "Pruijn G.", "AuthorID": "7007034645", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomolecular Chemistry, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Institute for Molecules and Materials, Radboud University"}, "7006363575": {"Name": "Verbeek M.", "AuthorID": "7006363575", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Radboud University, Medical Centre"}, "24923624300": {"Name": "Rietveld A.", "AuthorID": "24923624300", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Medical Centre"}, "7006305683": {"Name": "Van Engelen B.", "AuthorID": "7006305683", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University, Medical Centre"}, "35398272300": {"Name": "Lundberg I.", "AuthorID": "35398272300", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "23495299100": {"Name": "Chinoy H.", "AuthorID": "23495299100", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester"}, "7201524789": {"Name": "Lamb J.", "AuthorID": "7201524789", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrated Genomic Medical Research, University of Manchester"}, "57214353817": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "57214353817", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, MRC, ARUK, Institute of Ageing and Chronic Disease, University of Liverpool"}, "55730670600": {"Name": "Roberts M.", "AuthorID": "55730670600", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602390477": {"Name": "Badrising U.", "AuthorID": "6602390477", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University, Medical Centre"}, "7005070820": {"Name": "De Bleecker J.", "AuthorID": "7005070820", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Neuromuscular Reference Centre, Ghent University Hospital"}, "35243075300": {"Name": "Machado P.", "AuthorID": "35243075300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, University College London"}, "15075798500": {"Name": "Hanna M.", "AuthorID": "15075798500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases, University College London"}, "36051878700": {"Name": "Plestilova L.", "AuthorID": "36051878700", "AffiliationID": "60016605, 60008395", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Rheumatology, Charles University"}, "55941728700": {"Name": "Vencovsky J.", "AuthorID": "55941728700", "AffiliationID": "60016605, 60008395", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, First Faculty of Medicine, Institute of Rheumatology, Charles University"}}}
