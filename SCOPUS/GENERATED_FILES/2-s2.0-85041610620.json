Sci.", "Volume": "387", "Issue": null, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 60, "PageEnd": 69, "CitedBy": 1, "DOI": "10.1016/j.jns.2018.01.029", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85041610620&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018Background: The Pulfrich phenomenon (PF) is the illusory perception that an object moving linearly along a 2-D plane appears to instead follow an elliptical 3-D trajectory, a consequence of inter-eye asymmetry in the timing of visual object identification in the visual cortex; with optic neuritis as a common etiology. Objective: We have designed an objective method to identify the presence and magnitude of the PF, in conjunction with a cooresponding strategy by which to abolish the effect; with monocular application of neutral density filters to the less affected fellow eye, in patients with MS and a history of optic neuropathy (e.g. related to acute optic neuritis or subclinical optic neuropathy). Methods: Twenty-three MS patients with a history of acute unilateral or bilateral optic neuritis, and ten healthy control subjects (HC) were recruited to participate in a pilot study to assess our strategy. Subjects were asked to indicate whether a linearly moving pendulum ball followed a linear 2-D path versus an illusory 3-D elliptical object-motion trajectory, by reporting the ball's approximation to one of nine horizontally-oriented colored wires that were positioned parallel to one another and horizontal to the linear pendulum path. Perceived motion of the bob that moved along wires behind or in front (along the \u2018Z' plane) of the middle reference wire indicated an illusory elliptical trajectory of ball motion consistent with the PF. Results: When the neutral density filter titration was applied to the fellow eye the severity of the PF decreased, eventually being fully abolished in all but one patient. The magnitude of neutral density filtering required correlated to the severity of the patient's initial PF magnitude (p < 0.001). Conclusions: We ascertained the magnitude of the visual illusion associated with the PF, and the corresponding magnitude of neutral density filtering necessary to abolish it.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymmetric visual transmission", "Neutral density filter", "Pulfrich phenomenon", "Visual illusion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Flicker Fusion", "Humans", "Illusions", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motion Perception", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Optic Neuritis", "Photic Stimulation", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041610620", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56491358600": {"Name": "Sobhanian M.J.", "AuthorID": "56491358600", "AffiliationID": "60122541, 60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57200555255": {"Name": "Agarwal R.", "AuthorID": "57200555255", "AffiliationID": "60122541, 60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin"}, "40161488700": {"Name": "Kildebeck E.", "AuthorID": "40161488700", "AffiliationID": "60009415", "AffiliationName": "The Center for Engineering Innovation, University of Texas at Dallas"}, "57194147050": {"Name": "Frohman B.S.", "AuthorID": "57194147050", "AffiliationID": "60122541, 60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin"}, "56845541100": {"Name": "Frohman A.N.", "AuthorID": "56845541100", "AffiliationID": "60122541, 60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Dell Medical School, University of Texas at Austin"}, "7004256856": {"Name": "Frohman E.M.", "AuthorID": "7004256856", "AffiliationID": "60009415", "AffiliationName": "Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas"}, "6602392353": {"Name": "Frohman T.C.", "AuthorID": "6602392353", "AffiliationID": "60009415", "AffiliationName": "Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas"}, "57193950408": {"Name": "Meltzer E.", "AuthorID": "57193950408", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Partner's Neurology Residency Training Program, Massachusettes General & Brigham & Women's Hospitals, Harvard Medical School"}, "7005526795": {"Name": "Galetta S.L.", "AuthorID": "7005526795", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Ophthalmology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "7004524080": {"Name": "Balcer L.J.", "AuthorID": "7004524080", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Ophthalmology, New York University School of Medicine"}, "26428499000": {"Name": "Saidha S.", "AuthorID": "26428499000", "AffiliationID": "60001555", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, "7006065793": {"Name": "White O.", "AuthorID": "7006065793", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne"}, "6602074839": {"Name": "Villoslada P.", "AuthorID": "6602074839", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "University of California at San Francisco"}, "31967711400": {"Name": "Martinez-Lapiscina E.H.", "AuthorID": "31967711400", "AffiliationID": "60010814", "AffiliationName": "Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi Sunyer (IDIBAPS)"}, "57033685900": {"Name": "Paul F.", "AuthorID": "57033685900", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60024629", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Clinical Research Center, Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neuro-ophthalmology Expertise Centre VUmc"}, "7801616439": {"Name": "Rennaker R.L.", "AuthorID": "7801616439", "AffiliationID": "60009415", "AffiliationName": "Behavioral and Brain Sciences, University of Texas at Dallas"}, "7005155848": {"Name": "Kardon R.", "AuthorID": "7005155848", "AffiliationID": "112569978", "AffiliationName": "Center for Prevention and Treatment of Visual Loss"}}}
