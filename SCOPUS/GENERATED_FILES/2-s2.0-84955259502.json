The purpose of this retrieval study was to: (1) report on corrosion at the stem-cement interface and (2) correlate these findings with clinical data. Methods: We analysed cemented stems (n = 36) composed of cobalt-chromium (CoCr) and stainless steel (SS) in a series of revised metal-on-metal hips. We performed detailed inspection of each stem to assess the severity of corrosion at the stem-cement interface using a scale of 1 (low) to 5 (severe). We assessed the severity of corrosion at each stem trunnion and measured wear rates at the head taper and bearing surfaces. We used non-parametric tests to determine the significance of differences between the CoCr and SS stems in relation to: (1) pre-revision whole blood Co and Cr metal ion levels, (2) trunnion corrosion, (3) bearing surface wear and (4) taper material loss. Results: The corrosion scores of CoCr stems were significantly greater than SS stems (p < 0.01). Virtually all stem trunnions in both alloy groups had minimal evidence of corrosion. The median pre-revision Co levels of implants with CoCr stems were significantly greater than the SS stems (p < 0.01). There was no significant difference in relation to pre-revision Cr levels (p = 0.521). There was no significant difference between the two stem types in relation to bearing wear (p = 0.926) or taper wear (p = 0.148). Conclusions: Severe corrosion of cemented femoral stems is a common finding at our retrieval centre; surgeons should consider corrosion of CoCr stems as a potential source of metal ions when revising a hip.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cemented stem", "Corrosion", "Metal-on-metal", "Retrieval"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alloys", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Bone Cements", "Chromium", "Cobalt", "Corrosion", "Female", "Femur", "Hip Joint", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Male", "Metal-on-Metal Joint Prostheses", "Metals", "Middle Aged", "Prosthesis Design", "Prosthesis Failure", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955259502", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.S.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "26532304500": {"Name": "Berber R.", "AuthorID": "26532304500", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57072986300": {"Name": "Panagiotopoulos A.C.", "AuthorID": "57072986300", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "55982205200": {"Name": "Whittaker R.K.", "AuthorID": "55982205200", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "57073967300": {"Name": "Rhead C.", "AuthorID": "57073967300", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
