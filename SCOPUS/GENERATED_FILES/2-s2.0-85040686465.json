It was shown that oxidation current decreased with an increase in the rotation rate (\u03c9) for all alcohols studied over electrodeposited Pt film electrodes. In contrast, the oxidation current was found to increase with an increase in the \u03c9 for Pt/C in ethanol and n-butanol-containing solutions. The decrease was found to be nearly reversible for ethanol and n-butanol at the electrodeposited Pt film electrode ruling out the possibility of intermediate COads poisoning being the sole cause of the decrease and was attributed to the formation of soluble intermediate species which diffuse away from the electrode at higher \u03c9. In contrast, an increase in the current with an increase in \u03c9 for the carbon supported catalyst may suggest that the increase in residence time of the soluble species within the catalyst layer, results in further oxidation of these species. Furthermore, the reversibility of the peak current on decreasing the \u03c9 could indicate that the surface state has not significantly changed due to the sluggish reaction kinetics of ethanol and n-butanol.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Butanol", "Direct alcohol fuel cells", "Electro-oxidation", "Ethanol", "Methanol", "Platinum", "Rotating disk electrode (RDE)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alcohol molecules", "Carbon supported catalyst", "Carbon-supported Pt", "Electrodeposited films", "Intermediate specie", "Oxidation currents", "Oxidation reactions", "Rotating disk electrodes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040686465", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"55313618000": {"Name": "Puthiyapura V.K.", "AuthorID": "55313618000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, The University of Manchester"}, "56243169300": {"Name": "Hardacre C.", "AuthorID": "56243169300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical Engineering and Analytical Science, The University of Manchester"}, "57054480000": {"Name": "Lin W.F.", "AuthorID": "57054480000", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "7402735903": {"Name": "Russell A.E.", "AuthorID": "7402735903", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
