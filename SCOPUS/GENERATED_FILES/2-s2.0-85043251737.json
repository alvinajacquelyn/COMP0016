This reliance on migration is demonstrated by the existence of a subset of inherited immunodeficiencies that are a result of mutations that impact on migratory processes. Much of our understanding of the importance of migration in the immune response comes from the study of these immunodeficiencies. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is the first described and best studied migratory immunodeficiency, and this article will focus on this disorder, and its wide ranging impact on immune function. We will also give an overview of other migration defects that lead to immunodeficiency, including their genetic, biochemical, and cell biological basis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Actin", "Adhesion", "ARP2/3", "Chemokine", "Chemotaxis", "Cytoskeleton", "Hereditary", "Immunodeficiency", "Lamellipodium", "Migration", "Podosome", "WASp"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043251737", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6603183187": {"Name": "Moulding D.", "AuthorID": "6603183187", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7005085037": {"Name": "Thrasher A.", "AuthorID": "7005085037", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
