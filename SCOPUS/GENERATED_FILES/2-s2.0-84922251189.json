The main contribution to the primary currents detectable with EEG and MEG comes from ionic currents in the apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, aligned perpendicularly to the local cortical surface. We provide evidence from an in-vivo experiment that the variation in MRI-based myeloarchitecture measures across the cortex predicts the variation of the current density over individuals and thus is of functional relevance. Equivalent current dipole locations and moments due to pitch onset evoked response fields (ERFs) were estimated by means of a variational Bayesian algorithm. The myeloarchitecture was estimated indirectly from individual high resolution quantitative multi-parameter maps (MPMs) acquired at 800. \u03bcm isotropic resolution. Myelin estimates across cortical areas correlated positively with dipole magnitude. This correlation was spatially specific: regions of interest in the auditory cortex provided significantly better models than those covering whole hemispheres. Based on the MPM data we identified the auditory cortical area TE1.2 as the most likely origin of the pitch ERFs measured by MEG. We can now proceed to exploit the higher spatial resolution of quantitative MPMs to identify the cortical origin of M/EEG signals, inform M/EEG source reconstruction and explore structure-function relationships at a fine structural level in the living human brain.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory", "MEG", "MPM", "Myelin or myeloarchitecture", "Quantitative MRI", "Source reconstruction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Auditory Cortex", "Electroencephalography", "Electrophysiological Phenomena", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Magnetoencephalography", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922251189", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56134395700": {"Name": "Helbling S.", "AuthorID": "56134395700", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Medical Psychology, Goethe University Frankfurt"}, "36085035000": {"Name": "Sedley W.", "AuthorID": "36085035000", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University"}, "7102183421": {"Name": "Griffiths T.D.", "AuthorID": "7102183421", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Newcastle University"}, "36446755200": {"Name": "Teki S.", "AuthorID": "36446755200", "AffiliationID": "60105784, 60000179", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire des Systemes Perceptifs, CNRS UMR 8248, Departement d'Etudes Cognitives, Ecole Normale Superiere"}, "9736087500": {"Name": "Callaghan M.F.", "AuthorID": "9736087500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25823875500": {"Name": "Mohammadi S.", "AuthorID": "25823875500", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Systems Neuroscience, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf"}, "6602786222": {"Name": "Weiskopf N.", "AuthorID": "6602786222", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7202142345": {"Name": "Barnes G.R.", "AuthorID": "7202142345", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
