However, this view obscures the ways in which conflict-era actors and their networks shape core decision regarding resource allocation. This article examines the political economies of resistance-era networks in the post-conflict period, focusing specifically on the large-scale pensions programme. The article argues that these former fighters tasked with registration verification serve as \u2018street level bureaucrats\u2019 and have re-shaped the programme to reflect their views of the conflict and interests. This is not a trivial matter\u2013in 2015 the programme consumed 9 per cent of the national budget\u2013and this work suggests that pensions should be viewed as a core aspect of post-conflict economic development in Timor-Leste and, more broadly, that the role of conflict actors in defining such programmes is essential to understanding redistributive policies after conflict.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051720695", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"55938053500": {"Name": "Roll K.", "AuthorID": "55938053500", "AffiliationID": "60112746, 60026851, 60115349", "AffiliationName": "Somerville College and Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford"}}}
