Recent experimental studies using advanced imaging and molecular techniques, have yielded new insights into the mechanisms through which reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the inflammatory response induced by acute myocardial IRI-\u201dadding fuel to the fire\u201d. The infiltration of inflammatory cells into the MI zone, leads to elevated myocardial concentrations of ROS, cytokine release, and activation of apoptotic and necrotic death pathways. Anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies have failed to protect the heart against acute myocardial IRI. This may be, in part, due to a lack of understanding of the time course, nature and mechanisms of the inflammation and redox dysregulation, which occur in the setting of acute myocardial IRI. Conclusion: In this article, we examine the inflammatory response and redox dysregulation induced by acute myocardial IRI, and highlight potential therapeutic options for targeting redox dysregulation, in order to attenuate the detrimental effects of the inflammatory response following an AMI, so as to reduce MI size and prevent heart failure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Inflammation", "Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury", "Neutrophils", "Oxidative stress", "Reactive oxygen species", "Redox dysregulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antioxidants", "Heart", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Myocardium", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047836670", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"36025093100": {"Name": "Hern\u00e1ndez-Res\u00e9ndiz S.", "AuthorID": "36025093100", "AffiliationID": "60010748", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Biomedicine, National Institute of Cardiology I.
