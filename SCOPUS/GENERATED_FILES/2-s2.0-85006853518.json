Until very recently, these configuration procedures were limited to optimising a single performance objective, such as the running time or solution quality achieved by the algorithm being configured. However, in many applications there is more than one performance objective of interest. This gives rise to the multi-objective automatic algorithm configuration problem, which involves finding a Pareto set of configurations of a given target algorithm that characterises trade-offs between multiple performance objectives. In this work, we introduce MO-ParamILS, a multiobjective extension of the state-of-the-art single-objective algorithm configuration framework ParamILS, and demonstrate that it produces good results on several challenging bi-objective algorithm configuration scenarios compared to a base-line obtained from using a state-of-the-art single-objective algorithm configurator.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Algorithm configuration", "Local search algorithms", "Multiobjective optimization", "Parameter tuning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithm configurations", "Automated algorithms", "Automatic algorithms", "Development and applications", "Local search algorithm", "Parameter-tuning", "Performance objective", "Solution quality"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006853518", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55974628000": {"Name": "Blot A.", "AuthorID": "55974628000", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "University of British Columbia"}, "6603180053": {"Name": "Jourdan L.", "AuthorID": "6603180053", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60008134, 60122064, 60013373", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille, Inria, CNRS, UMR 9189 \u2013 CRIStAL"}, "57195234359": {"Name": "Kessaci-Marmion M.\u00c9.", "AuthorID": "57195234359", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60008134, 60122064, 60013373", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille, Inria, CNRS, UMR 9189 \u2013 CRIStAL"}, "6701843335": {"Name": "Hoos H.H.", "AuthorID": "6701843335", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "University of British Columbia"}, "23974957500": {"Name": "Trautmann H.", "AuthorID": "23974957500", "AffiliationID": "60000401", "AffiliationName": "University of M\u00fcnster"}}}
