Comprehensive and exhaustive characterizations of the synthesized PFA composite films validate the proper formation of \u03b2-polymorphs in PVDF. Significant improvements of both \u03b2-phase crystallization (F(\u03b2) \u2248 71.4%) and dielectric constant (\u03f5 \u2248 218 at 20 Hz for PFA of 7.5 mass %) are the twosome realizations of our current study. Enhancement of \u03b2-phase nucleation in the composites can be thought as a contribution of the strong interaction of the FA particles with the PVDF chains. Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) interfacial polarization approves the establishment of thermally stable high dielectric values measured over a wide temperature spectrum. The optimized high dielectric and electroactive films are further employed as an active energy storage material in designing our device named as OPSESC. Self-charging under visible light irradiation without an external biasing electrical field and simultaneous remarkable self-storage of photogenerated electrical energy are the two foremost aptitudes and the spotlight of our present investigation. Our as fabricated device delivers an impressively high energy density of 7.84 mWh/g and an excellent specific capacitance of 61 F/g which is superior relative to the other photon induced two electrode organic self-charging energy storage devices reported so far. Our device also proves the realistic utility with good recycling capability by facilitating commercially available light emitting diode.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dielectric relaxation", "electroactive PVDF", "energy storage", "MWS interfacial polarization", "self-charging photovoltaics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electro actives", "High energy densities", "Interfacial polarization", "Maxwell-Wagner-sillars", "Organic photovoltaics", "Photovoltaics", "Poly(vinylidene fluoride) composites", "Visible-light irradiation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024869801", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"15045583000": {"Name": "Roy S.", "AuthorID": "15045583000", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "57219524421": {"Name": "Thakur P.", "AuthorID": "57219524421", "AffiliationID": "100350557", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Netaji Nagar College for Women"}, "56578161300": {"Name": "Hoque N.A.", "AuthorID": "56578161300", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "16456874100": {"Name": "Bagchi B.", "AuthorID": "16456874100", "AffiliationID": "60023083", "AffiliationName": "Fuel Cell and Battery Division, Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute"}, "57194899759": {"Name": "Khatun F.", "AuthorID": "57194899759", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "56248104400": {"Name": "Kool A.", "AuthorID": "56248104400", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "55476996600": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55476996600", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "55977661100": {"Name": "Sepay N.", "AuthorID": "55977661100", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jadavpur University"}}}
