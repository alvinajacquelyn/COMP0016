Historically such property investment decisions have been seen within a portfolio diversification paradigm that has sought to balance risk and return. This paper considers the role of the supply of assets in the determining and constraining the UK institutional portfolio. The supply of real estate assets not only expands during property booms but has also been transformed by a long term urban development cycle as cities adapt to cars and the ICT revolution that has brought new property forms. The research examines long term trends in investment change by disaggregating into ten property forms rather than the usual three land use sectors. It then assesses to what extent investment patterns can be explained in terms of portfolio theory, short term net returns of individual sectors or driven by the supply of real estate assets. It concludes that the supply of real assets is an overlooked explanation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["financial institutions", "new property forms", "Portfolios", "Property supply", "urban development cycle"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020262328", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"55474242200": {"Name": "Jones C.", "AuthorID": "55474242200", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Urban Institute, Heriot-Watt University"}, "6508292654": {"Name": "Dunse N.", "AuthorID": "6508292654", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Urban Institute, Heriot-Watt University"}, "56891418800": {"Name": "Cutsforth K.", "AuthorID": "56891418800", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Urban Institute, Heriot-Watt University"}, "41561772000": {"Name": "Livingstone N.", "AuthorID": "41561772000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett Planning School, University College London"}}}
