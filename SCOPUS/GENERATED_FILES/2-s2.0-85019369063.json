Here we introduce the concept of Liquidus Tracking (LT) using a semi-automated process for liquid volumes of up to 450 ml including 130 ml of alginate encapsulated liver cells (AELC) that archived controlled and reversible vitrification with minimized toxicity. First a CPA solution with optimal properties for LT was developed by employing different small scale test systems. Combining sugars such as glucose and raffinose with Me2SO improved post-exposure (at +0.5 \u00b0C) viabilities from 6% \u00b13.6 for Me2SO alone up to 58% \u00b16.1 and 65% \u00b114.2 respectively (p < 0.01). Other permeating CPAs (e.g. ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methanol) were investigated as partial replacements for Me2SO. A mixture of Me2SO, ethylene glycol and glucose (ratio 4:2:1\u2013 termed LTdeg) supported glass-forming tendencies with appropriate low viscosities and toxicities required for LT. When running the full LT process, using Me2SO alone, no viable cells were recovered; using LTdeg, viable recoveries were improved to 40% \u00b18 (p<0.001%). Further refinements of improved mixing technique further improved recovery after LT. Recoveries of specific liver cell functions such as synthesis of albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were retained in post thaw cultures. In summary: By developing a low-toxicity CPA solution of low viscosity (LTdeg) suitable for LT and by improving the stirring system, post-warming viability of AELC of up to 90% and a AFP secretion of 89% were reached. Results show that it may be possible to develop LT as a suitable cryogenic preservation process for different cell therapy products at large scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bioartificial liver device", "CPA toxicity", "Large volume vitrification", "Liquidus tracking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alginates", "Cell Culture Techniques", "Cryopreservation", "Cryoprotective Agents", "Dimethyl Sulfoxide", "Ethylene Glycol", "Glucose", "Glucuronic Acid", "Hep G2 Cells", "Hepatocytes", "Hexuronic Acids", "Humans", "Propylene Glycol", "Raffinose", "Somatostatin-Secreting Cells", "Vitrification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019369063", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56416355400": {"Name": "Puschmann E.", "AuthorID": "56416355400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute for Liver & Digestive Health, Royal Free Campus"}, "7004037002": {"Name": "Selden C.", "AuthorID": "7004037002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute for Liver & Digestive Health, Royal Free Campus"}, "56415818500": {"Name": "Butler S.", "AuthorID": "56415818500", "AffiliationID": "116104532", "AffiliationName": "Planer PLC"}, "7102974662": {"Name": "Fuller B.", "AuthorID": "7102974662", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Department of Surgery, Royal Free Campus"}}}
