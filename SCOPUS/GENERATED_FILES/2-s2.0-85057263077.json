By formulating the transmission function of an arbitrary aperture, desired field distribution can be generated. A geometric-phase based metasurface is used to implement the aperture that is designed to convert an OAM wave to a directional wave with distinguishable radiation direction according to the incident OAM. Therefore, by examining the directivity, we can tell the value of incident OAM. The effectiveness of our approach is validated by numerical calculation and full-wave simulation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Directional waves", "Field distribution", "Full-wave simulations", "Geometric phase", "Numerical calculation", "Orbital angular momentum", "Radiation direction", "Transmission function"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057263077", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57116687500": {"Name": "Chen M.", "AuthorID": "57116687500", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "University of Hong Kong, Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department"}, "56353178500": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "56353178500", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "Zhejiang University, College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering"}}}
