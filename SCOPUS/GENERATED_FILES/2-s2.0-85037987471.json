Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.This article investigates the ways in which students are constructed in contemporary English higher education policy. First, it contends that, contrary to assumptions made in the academic literature, students are not conceptualised as \u2018empowered consumers\u2019; instead their vulnerability is emphasised by both government and unions. Second, it identifies other dominant discourses, namely that of \u2018future worker\u2019 and \u2018hard-worker\u2019. These articulate with extant debates about both the repositioning of higher education as an economic good and the use of the \u2018hard-working\u2019 trope across other areas of social policy. Third, it shows that differences are drawn between groups of students. Contrasts are drawn, for example, between international students, juxtaposing the \u2018brightest and best\u2019 with those who are considered \u2018sham\u2019. Finally, the article argues that the figure of the \u2018vulnerable\u2019 student and \u2018thwarted consumer\u2019 feeds into broader government narratives about its policy trajectory, legitimising contemporary reforms and excusing the apparent failure of previous policies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["consumerism", "England", "Higher education", "policy", "students"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037987471", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"7402358771": {"Name": "Brooks R.", "AuthorID": "7402358771", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Surrey"}}}
