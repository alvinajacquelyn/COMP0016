The aim of this study was to perform an extensive in vitro characterization of this effect using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling (PKPD) of time-kill experiments in order to estimate clinical efficacy. Methods: For six clinical strains, 312 individual time-kill experiments were performed including 113 unique pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. A wide range of concentrations (0.25-8192 mg/L for colistin and 1-8192 mg/L for fusidic acid) were explored, alone and in combination. PKPD modelling sought to quantify synergistic effects. Results: A PKPD model confirmed synergy in that colistin EC50 was found to decrease by 83% in the presence of fusidic acid, and fusidic acid maximumincrease in killing rate (Emax) also increased 58% in the presence of colistin. Simulations indicated, however, that at clinically achievable free concentrations, the combination may be bacteriostatic in colistin-susceptible strains, but growth inhibition probabilitywas<20%in a colistin-resistant strain. Conclusions: Fusidic acid may be a useful agent to add to colistin in a multidrug combination for MDR Acinetobacter baumannii.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acinetobacter baumannii", "Acinetobacter Infections", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Colistin", "Drug Synergism", "Fusidic Acid", "Humans", "Microbial Viability", "Models, Theoretical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063000120", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"54420882300": {"Name": "Phee L.M.", "AuthorID": "54420882300", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004167527": {"Name": "Wareham D.W.", "AuthorID": "7004167527", "AffiliationID": "60159931", "AffiliationName": "Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "55130858400": {"Name": "Kloprogge F.", "AuthorID": "55130858400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "57207833493": {"Name": "Morris R.", "AuthorID": "57207833493", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Research Centre, Glaxo Smith Kline"}, "57211420367": {"Name": "Barrett J.", "AuthorID": "57211420367", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Medicines Research Centre, Glaxo Smith Kline"}}}
