The described approaches are applicable to many short-range radar sensors. In particular, we focus on FMCW radar, which are ubiquitous in numerous applications, including gesture recognition radar, automotive radar, and imaging radar. The three digital MTI filtering methods explored are background subtraction, finite impulse response (FIR) filtering, and infinite impulse response (IIR) filtering. Each of the methods is implemented in the time domain for simpler logic implementation. We apply the MTI methods on data sets gathered using a C-band FMCW radar in both a short-range, direct line-of-sight scenario and a complex cluttered through wall radar scenario. Based on the analyses, it is shown that each of the MTI techniques are extremely effective when deployed in the right scenario. Background subtraction is found to be well suited for slow-moving targets. FIR and IIR filtering techniques provide the simplest, one-step processes for moving target segmentation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["digital filters", "FIR filters", "FMCW radar", "IIR filters", "moving target indication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Background subtraction", "Chirp", "FMCW radar", "Line-of-sight scenarios", "Moving target indication", "Moving target indication techniques", "Short range radar", "Slow-moving targets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045219236", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36185201600": {"Name": "Ash M.", "AuthorID": "36185201600", "AffiliationID": "60111377", "AffiliationName": "PA Consulting Group, Cambridge Technology Centre"}, "36186273500": {"Name": "Ritchie M.", "AuthorID": "36186273500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "34867832000": {"Name": "Chetty K.", "AuthorID": "34867832000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
