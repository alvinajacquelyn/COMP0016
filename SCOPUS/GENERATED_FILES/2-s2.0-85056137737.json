METHODS In a multicenter, open-label trial with blinded end-point evaluation, we randomly assigned adults undergoing maintenance hemodialysis to receive either high-dose iron sucrose, administered intravenously in a proactive fashion (400 mg monthly, unless the ferritin concentration was >700 \u03bcg per liter or the transferrin saturation was \u226540%), or low-dose iron sucrose, administered intravenously in a reactive fashion (0 to 400 mg monthly, with a ferritin concentration of <200 \u03bcg per liter or a transferrin saturation of <20% being a trigger for iron administration). The primary end point was the composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or death, assessed in a time-to-first-event analysis. These end points were also analyzed as recurrent events. Other secondary end points included death, infection rate, and dose of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent. Noninferiority of the high-dose group to the low-dose group would be established if the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio for the primary end point did not cross 1.25. RESULTS A total of 2141 patients underwent randomization (1093 patients to the high-dose group and 1048 to the low-dose group). The median follow-up was 2.1 years. Patients in the high-dose group received a median monthly iron dose of 264 mg (interquartile range [25th to 75th percentile], 200 to 336), as compared with 145 mg (interquartile range, 100 to 190) in the low-dose group. The median monthly dose of an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent was 29,757 IU in the high-dose group and 38,805 IU in the low-dose group (median difference, \u22127539 IU; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u22129485 to \u22125582). A total of 320 patients (29.3%) in the high-dose group had a primary end-point event, as compared with 338 (32.3%) in the low-dose group (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.00; P<0.001 for noninferiority; P=0.04 for superiority). In an analysis that used a recurrent-events approach, there were 429 events in the high-dose group and 507 in the low-dose group (rate ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.92). The infection rate was the same in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Among patients undergoing hemodialysis, a high-dose intravenous iron regimen administered proactively was superior to a low-dose regimen administered reactively and resulted in lower doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent being administered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravenous", "Adult", "Aged", "Anemia", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Ferric Oxide, Saccharated", "Ferritins", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hematinics", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Renal Dialysis", "Single-Blind Method", "Transferrin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056137737", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55412920000": {"Name": "Macdougall I.C.", "AuthorID": "55412920000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, King's College Hospital, University College London"}, "57204177676": {"Name": "White C.", "AuthorID": "57204177676", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, King's College Hospital, University College London"}, "7202992832": {"Name": "Wheeler D.C.", "AuthorID": "7202992832", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, King's College Hospital, University College London"}, "57205652519": {"Name": "Bhandari S.", "AuthorID": "57205652519", "AffiliationID": "60005954, 60107756", "AffiliationName": "Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Hull York Medical School"}, "7006817812": {"Name": "Farrington K.", "AuthorID": "7006817812", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "University of Hertfordshire"}, "56405183300": {"Name": "Kalra P.A.", "AuthorID": "56405183300", "AffiliationID": "60008873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Renal Medicine, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202558724": {"Name": "McMurray J.J.V.", "AuthorID": "7202558724", "AffiliationID": "60032768", "AffiliationName": "British Heart Foundation Cardiovascular Research Centre"}, "57202698641": {"Name": "Tomson C.R.V.", "AuthorID": "57202698641", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, Oxford Kidney Unit, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005357618": {"Name": "Winearls C.G.", "AuthorID": "7005357618", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60021328, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, Oxford Kidney Unit, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56223993400": {"Name": "Anker S.D.", "AuthorID": "56223993400", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60106629", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology and Metabolism, Department of Cardiology, Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies, German Center for Cardiovascular Research, Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "35765569400": {"Name": "Murray H.", "AuthorID": "35765569400", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow"}, "7006691891": {"Name": "Ford I.", "AuthorID": "7006691891", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
