Previous evidence has demonstrated that childhood victimization is associated with elevated levels of inflammation biomarkers measured decades after exposure. However, it is unclear whether this association is (1) already detectable in young people, (2) different in males and females, and (3) confounded by genetic liability to inflammation. Here we sought to address these questions. Method Participants were 2232 children followed from birth to age 18 years as part of the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. Childhood victimization was measured prospectively from birth to age 12 years. Inflammation was measured through C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in dried blood spots at age 18 years. Latent genetic liability for high inflammation levels was assessed through a twin-based method. Results Greater exposure to childhood victimization was associated with higher CRP levels at age 18 (serum-equivalent means were 0.65 in non-victimized Study members, 0.74 in those exposed to one victimization type, and 0.81 in those exposed to poly-victimization; p = 0.018). However, this association was driven by a significant association in females (serum-equivalent means were 0.75 in non-victimized females, 0.87 in those exposed to one type of victimization, and 1.19 in those exposed to poly-victimization; p = 0.010), while no significant association was observed in males (p = 0.19). Victimized females showed elevated CRP levels independent of latent genetic influence, as well as childhood socioeconomic status, and waist-hip ratio and body temperature at the time of CRP assessment. Conclusion Childhood victimization is associated with elevated CRP levels in young women, independent of latent genetic influences and other key risk factors. These results strengthen causal inference about the effects of childhood victimization on inflammation levels in females by accounting for potential genetic confounding.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bullying victimization", "C-reactive protein", "Childhood maltreatment", "Childhood victimization", "Early life stress", "Inflammation", "Sex differences"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult Survivors of Child Abuse", "Biomarkers", "C-Reactive Protein", "Child Abuse", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032193989", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"57191952662": {"Name": "Baldwin J.R.", "AuthorID": "57191952662", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "55929284200": {"Name": "Arseneault L.", "AuthorID": "55929284200", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7102382566": {"Name": "Caspi A.", "AuthorID": "7102382566", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University"}, "9235818300": {"Name": "Fisher H.L.", "AuthorID": "9235818300", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7005557909": {"Name": "Moffitt T.E.", "AuthorID": "7005557909", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University"}, "24068771700": {"Name": "Ambler A.", "AuthorID": "24068771700", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "8570621700": {"Name": "Dove R.", "AuthorID": "8570621700", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "56026148000": {"Name": "Kepa A.", "AuthorID": "56026148000", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7102377160": {"Name": "Matthews T.", "AuthorID": "7102377160", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57196190551": {"Name": "Menard A.", "AuthorID": "57196190551", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "MRC Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "24068309900": {"Name": "Danese A.", "AuthorID": "24068309900", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "National and Specialist CAMHS Trauma and Anxiety Clinic, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36765392300": {"Name": "Sugden K.", "AuthorID": "36765392300", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University"}, "56568517900": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "56568517900", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Duke University"}, "6603350351": {"Name": "Odgers C.L.", "AuthorID": "6603350351", "AffiliationID": "60008724", "AffiliationName": "Sanford School of Public Policy, Duke University"}, "7003615668": {"Name": "Pariante C.", "AuthorID": "7003615668", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}}}
