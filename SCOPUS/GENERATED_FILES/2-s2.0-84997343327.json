Despite the systemic impact of hypoxia-ischaemia, the resulting brain damage was previously reported to be largely limited to the hippocampus. However, the thalamus and the mammillary bodies are parts of the hippocampal-diencephalic network and are therefore also at risk of injury following hypoxic-ischaemic events. Here, we report a neuroimaging investigation of diencephalic damage in a group of 18 patients with DA (age range 11\u201335 years), and an equal number of controls. Importantly, we uncovered a marked degree of atrophy in the mammillary bodies in two thirds of our patients. In addition, as a group, patients had mildly reduced thalamic volumes. The size of the anterior-mid thalamic (AMT) segment was correlated with patients' visual memory performance. Thus, in addition to the hippocampus, the diencephalic structures also appear to play a role in the patients' memory deficit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hippocampus", "Hypoxia-ischaemia", "Mammillary bodies", "Memory", "Thalamus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Amnesia", "Atrophy", "Child", "Female", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Male", "Mammillary Bodies", "Memory, Episodic", "Memory, Short-Term", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84997343327", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56902545200": {"Name": "Dzieciol A.M.", "AuthorID": "56902545200", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006246597": {"Name": "Gadian D.G.", "AuthorID": "7006246597", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004489148": {"Name": "Vargha-Khadem F.", "AuthorID": "7004489148", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7006908261": {"Name": "Bachevalier J.", "AuthorID": "7006908261", "AffiliationID": "60000928", "AffiliationName": "Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University"}, "6603762320": {"Name": "Saleem K.S.", "AuthorID": "6603762320", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health"}, "7201706528": {"Name": "Saunders R.", "AuthorID": "7201706528", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health"}, "7007041182": {"Name": "Mishkin M.", "AuthorID": "7007041182", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institutes of Health"}, "57203031127": {"Name": "Chong W.K.K.", "AuthorID": "57203031127", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "45961050200": {"Name": "Banks T.", "AuthorID": "45961050200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
