People investigated for TB in the UK often originate from areas with a high prevalence of HIV and other blood borne viruses (BBV). However, assessment for these infections is patchy. We determined the yield and costs of different testing strategies for BBV in a UK TB clinic. Methods: Since 2009, it has been routine to test all TB clinic attendees. Demographic, clinical and virological data were retrospectively extracted from patient notes and hospital databases. Results: Over 3 years, 1036 people were assessed in the TB service. 410 had a final diagnosis of active TB. HIV testing of the latter population diagnosed 27 new HIV cases at a cost of \u00a33017. When BBV testing was offered to all clinic attendees, a further 6 (total 33) new HIV, 5 Hepatitis B (HBV) and 2 Hepatitis C (HCV) diagnoses were made at a total cost of \u00a322,170. Conclusions: We have identified previously undiagnosed HIV, HBV and HCV in a TB clinic population. Our data suggest that despite increasing upfront expense, the associated yield argues strongly for BBV testing to be offered to all patients being investigated for possible TB, irrespective of their final diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hepatitis B virus", "Hepatitis C virus", "HIV infection", "Tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Blood-Borne Pathogens", "Clinical Laboratory Services", "Costs and Cost Analysis", "Demography", "Female", "Hepatitis B", "Hepatitis C", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Mass Screening", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Tuberculosis", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926132387", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56002143500": {"Name": "Sewell J.", "AuthorID": "56002143500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health and Population Sciences, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "55363218700": {"Name": "Capocci S.", "AuthorID": "55363218700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55494680000": {"Name": "Johnson J.", "AuthorID": "55494680000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "12787686900": {"Name": "Solamalai A.", "AuthorID": "12787686900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "North Central London TB Service, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202260726": {"Name": "Hopkins S.", "AuthorID": "7202260726", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602228387": {"Name": "Cropley I.", "AuthorID": "6602228387", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201998521": {"Name": "Webster D.P.", "AuthorID": "7201998521", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Virology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
