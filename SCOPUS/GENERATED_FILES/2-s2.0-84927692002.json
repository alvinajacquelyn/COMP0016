Our study is part of this project: We are exploring new, faster, and safer ways to digitalize manuscripts, without opening them, using X-ray tomography. A fundamental issue is the chemistry of the inks used for administrative documents: Contrary to pieces of high artistic or historical value, for such items, the composition is scarcely documented. We used X-ray fluorescence to investigate the inks of four Italian ordinary handwritten documents from the 15th to the 17th century. The results were correlated to X-ray images acquired with different techniques. In most cases, iron detected in the 'iron gall' inks produces image absorption contrast suitable for tomography reconstruction, allowing computer extraction of handwriting information from sets of projections. When absorption is too low, differential phase contrast imaging can reveal the characters from the substrate morphology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927692002", "SubjectAreas": [["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"26429142600": {"Name": "Albertin F.", "AuthorID": "26429142600", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de Base, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "57195744951": {"Name": "Margaritondo G.", "AuthorID": "57195744951", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de Base, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "55985279700": {"Name": "Astolfo A.", "AuthorID": "55985279700", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute"}, "54909987700": {"Name": "Stampanoni M.", "AuthorID": "54909987700", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, ETHZ"}, "56048429900": {"Name": "Peccenini E.", "AuthorID": "56048429900", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Bologna"}, "26643457900": {"Name": "Hwu Y.", "AuthorID": "26643457900", "AffiliationID": "60017396, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica"}, "56268256700": {"Name": "Kaplan F.", "AuthorID": "56268256700", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire d'humanites digitales, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}}}
