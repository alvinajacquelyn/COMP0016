All rights reserved.To explore the potential advantages of supplying occupant behavior models with inter-occupant diversity information, this study models the occupants' operation of windows in a monitored open-plan office at aggregate and individual levels. Subsequently, a calibrated energy model of the office area incorporates the developed models and multiple streams of monitored data to evaluate the predictive performance of the models and their contribution to enhance the reliability of building performance assessments. According to the results, individual window operation models outperformed the aggregate model in capturing the peak and variation of window operation across occupants in the free-running season, which resulted in a better assessment of thermal comfort. However, the individual models yielded an overestimation of peak heating demand, as compared with the benchmark value based on the actual window operations in a single year.", "AuthorKeywords": ["building performance simulation", "Energy performance", "Indoor climate", "user behaviour", "window operation models"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Trade Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061369723", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Architecture", "ENGI", "2216"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"56367480500": {"Name": "Tahmasebi F.", "AuthorID": "56367480500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University college London UCL, Institute for Environmental Design and Engineering IEDE"}, "7006750113": {"Name": "Mahdavi A.", "AuthorID": "7006750113", "AffiliationID": "60018163", "AffiliationName": "TU Wien, Department of Building Physics and Building Ecology"}}}
