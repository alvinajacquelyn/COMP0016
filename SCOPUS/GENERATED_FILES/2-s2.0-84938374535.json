Previous studies have demonstrated the utility of the human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) as a positron emission tomography/single photon emission computed tomography (PET/SPECT) genetic reporter for in vivo cellular imaging. Here, our aim was to extend on this work and construct a tricistronic vector with dual optical (firefly luciferase) and nuclear (hNET) in vivo imaging and ex vivo histochemical capabilities. Guiding this development, we describe how a fluorescent substrate for hNET, 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+), can be used to optimise vector design and serve as an in vitro functional screen. Methods: Vectors were designed to co-express a bright red-shifted firefly luciferase (FLuc), hNET and a small marker gene RQR8. Genes were co-expressed using 2A peptide linkage, and vectors were transduced into a T cell line, SupT1. Two vectors were constructed with different gene orientations; FLuc.2A.RQR8.2A.hNET and hNET.2A.FLuc.2A.RQR8. hNET function was assessed using ASP+-guided flow cytometry. In vivo cellular conspicuity was confirmed using sequential bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and SPECT imaging of transduced SupT1 cells injected into the flanks of mice. Results: SupT1/FLuc.2A.RQR8.2A.hNET cells resulted in >4-fold higher ASP+ uptake compared to SupT1/hNET.2A.FLuc.2A.RQR8, suggesting that 2A orientation effected hNET function. SupT1/FLuc.2A.RQR8.2A.hNET cells were readily visualised with both BLI and SPECT, demonstrating high signal to noise at 24 h post 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) administration. Conclusions: In this study, a pre-clinical tricistronic vector with flow cytometry, BLI, SPECT and histochemical capabilities was constructed, which can be widely applied in cell tracking studies supporting the development of cell therapies. The study further demonstrates that hNET function in engineered cells can be assessed using ASP+-guided flow cytometry in place of costly radiosubstrate methodologies. This fluorogenic approach is unique to the hNET PET/SPECT reporter and may prove valuable when screening large numbers of cell lines or vector/mutant constructs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ASP+", "BLI", "Cell imaging", "Multimodality imaging", "Norepinephrine transporter", "PET", "Reporter genes", "SPECT"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938374535", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"36993672300": {"Name": "Badar A.", "AuthorID": "36993672300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), University College London"}, "55794374600": {"Name": "Kiru L.", "AuthorID": "55794374600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "9434519300": {"Name": "Kalber T.L.", "AuthorID": "9434519300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (CABI), University College London"}, "36740260600": {"Name": "Jathoul A.", "AuthorID": "36740260600", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6508086239": {"Name": "Straathof K.", "AuthorID": "6508086239", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57211009223": {"Name": "Pule M.", "AuthorID": "57211009223", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6507965888": {"Name": "\u00c5rstad E.", "AuthorID": "6507965888", "AffiliationID": "60090043, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London"}}}
