Yet it remains unclear how different aspects of students\u2019 background and home context, their own attitudes and beliefs, and their experiences of particular teaching approaches in school might limit or facilitate their studying aspirations; concurrently, less research has specifically focused on and surveyed disadvantaged students. In order to gain more insight, 4780 students were surveyed, covering those in Year 7 (age 11\u201312 years) and in Year 8 (age 12\u201313) from schools in England with high proportions of those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Predictive modelling highlighted that the students\u2019 aspirations to study non-compulsory science in the future, and to study the particular subject of chemistry, were strongly associated with their extrinsic motivation towards science (their perceived utility of science, considered as a means to gain particular careers or skills), their intrinsic interest in science, and their engagement in extra-curricular activities. Additionally, their self-concept beliefs (their confidence in their own abilities in science), some teaching approaches, and encouragement from teachers and family alongside family science capital had smaller but still relevant associations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aspirations", "encouragement", "extrinsic motivation", "intrinsic", "science capital", "self-concept", "teaching approaches"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044071311", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"26038741700": {"Name": "Mujtaba T.", "AuthorID": "26038741700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "55962835400": {"Name": "Sheldrake R.", "AuthorID": "55962835400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "7202205455": {"Name": "Reiss M.J.", "AuthorID": "7202205455", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56182180700": {"Name": "Simon S.", "AuthorID": "56182180700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
