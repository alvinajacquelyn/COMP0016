All rights reserved.Diuretics are listed in hypertension guidelines as one of three equally weighted first-line treatment options. In order to differentiate between antihypertensives, a lot of discussion has been directed at side effect profiles and as a result, has created a perhaps disproportionate fear of the metabolic effects that can be associated with diuretics. Data, however, show that the risk of a clinically meaningful change in laboratory parameters is very low, whereas the benefits of volume control and natriuresis are high and the reductions in morbidity and mortality are clinically significant. Moreover, as clinically significant differences in safety and efficacy profiles exist among diuretics, several international guidelines have started making a distinction between thiazides (hydrochlorothiazide) and thiazide-like (chlorthalidone, indapamide) diuretics; and some of them now recommend longer acting thiazide-like diuretics. In time, pending more data, chlorthalidone and indapamide may need to be subdivided further into separate classifications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chlorthalidone", "diuretics", "hydrochlorothiazide", "hypertension", "indapamide", "thiazide", "thiazide-like"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diuretics", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Thiazides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069234480", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"7102984134": {"Name": "Burnier M.", "AuthorID": "7102984134", "AffiliationID": "122878085", "AffiliationName": "Hypertension Research Foundation"}, "35371943700": {"Name": "Bakris G.", "AuthorID": "35371943700", "AffiliationID": "60011092", "AffiliationName": "Comprehensive Hypertension Center, Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago Medicine"}, "57198065489": {"Name": "Williams B.", "AuthorID": "57198065489", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London, NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre"}}}
