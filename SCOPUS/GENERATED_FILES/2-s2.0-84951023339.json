The intention was to explore whether the sample volume throughput could be increased and potential operator bias avoided. Mussels Mytilus sp. were exposed in vivo to 50, 250 and 500\u03bcgL-1 single (SWCNTs) or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Using the NRR method, SWCNTs and MWCNTs caused concentration dependent decreases in neutral red retention time. However, a concentration dependent decrease in optical density was not observed using the NRU method. We conclude that the NRU method is not sensitive enough to assess carbon nanotube ecotoxicity in vivo in environmentally relevant media, and recommend using the NRR method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon nanotubes", "Cytotoxicity", "Ecotoxicity", "Mytilus", "Neutral red"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concentration-dependent", "Cytotoxicity assays", "Ecotoxicity", "Labour-intensive", "Mytilus", "Neutral Red", "Retention time", "Sample volume", "Animals", "Biological Assay", "Bivalvia", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Ecotoxicology", "Environmental Monitoring", "Hemolymph", "Lysosomes", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Models, Theoretical", "Nanotubes, Carbon", "Neutral Red", "Seawater", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Spectrophotometry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951023339", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57013812500": {"Name": "Miller M.A.", "AuthorID": "57013812500", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Marine Biodiversity and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "56926722400": {"Name": "Bankier C.", "AuthorID": "56926722400", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Marine Biodiversity and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}, "55882578000": {"Name": "Al-Shaeri M.A.M.", "AuthorID": "55882578000", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "King Abdulaziz University, Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Sciences"}, "7005196951": {"Name": "Hartl M.G.J.", "AuthorID": "7005196951", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Marine Biodiversity and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Heriot-Watt University"}}}
