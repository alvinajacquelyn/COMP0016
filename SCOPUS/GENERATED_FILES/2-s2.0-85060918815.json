Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.A plethora of studies over several decades has demonstrated the importance of autophagy in aging and age-related neurodegenerative disease. The role of autophagy in damage clearance and cell survival is well established, and supports a prevailing view that increasing autophagic activity can be broadly beneficial, and could form the basis of anti-aging interventions. However, macroautophagy/autophagy also promotes some elements of senescence. For example, in C. elegans hermaphrodites it facilitates conversion of intestinal biomass into yolk, leading to sex-specific gut atrophy and senescent steatosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "atg-13", "autophagy", "C. elegans", "IIS", "intestine", "lipoprotein", "pathology", "reproduction", "sexual dimorphism", "vitellogenin", "yolk"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Animals", "Autophagy", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Female", "Male", "Neurodegenerative Diseases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060918815", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"25822166900": {"Name": "Benedetto A.", "AuthorID": "25822166900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Genetics, Evolution & Environment, University College London"}, "7003303767": {"Name": "Gems D.", "AuthorID": "7003303767", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Healthy Ageing, Genetics, Evolution & Environment, University College London"}}}
