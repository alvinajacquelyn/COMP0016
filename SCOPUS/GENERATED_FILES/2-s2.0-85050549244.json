This heterogeneity and dynamic nature of sHsps has significantly hindered their structural characterization. Atomic coordinates are particularly lacking for vertebrate sHsps, where most available structures are of extensively truncated homomers. sHsps play important roles in maintaining protein levels in the cell and therefore in organismal health and disease. HspB2 and HspB3 are vertebrate sHsps that are found co-assembled in neuromuscular cells, and variants thereof are associated with disease. Here, we present the structure of human HspB2/B3, which crystallized as a hetero-tetramer in a 3:1 ratio. In the HspB2/B3 tetramer, the four \u03b1-crystallin domains (ACDs) assemble into a flattened tetrahedron which is pierced by two non-intersecting approximate dyads. Assembly is mediated by flexible \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d involving IXI/V motifs from terminal regions filling ACD pockets. Parts of the N-terminal region bind in an unfolded conformation into the anti-parallel shared ACD dimer grooves. Tracts of the terminal regions are not resolved, most likely due to their disorder in the crystal lattice. This first structure of a full-length human sHsp heteromer reveals the heterogeneous interactions of the terminal regions and suggests a plasticity that is important for the cytoprotective functions of sHsps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["asymmetric heteromer", "heat shock protein", "molecular chaperone", "polydispersity", "\u03b1-crystallin domain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Heat-Shock Proteins", "HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Models, Molecular", "Protein Binding", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Protein Multimerization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050549244", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"26649826800": {"Name": "Clark A.R.", "AuthorID": "26649826800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Crystallography, Institute of Structural & Molecular Biology"}, "7201573921": {"Name": "Cole A.R.", "AuthorID": "7201573921", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Crystallography, Institute of Structural & Molecular Biology"}, "7003604750": {"Name": "Keep N.H.", "AuthorID": "7003604750", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Crystallography, Institute of Structural & Molecular Biology"}, "7004333104": {"Name": "Slingsby C.", "AuthorID": "7004333104", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Crystallography, Institute of Structural & Molecular Biology"}, "6603195042": {"Name": "Vree Egberts W.", "AuthorID": "6603195042", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "7003921720": {"Name": "Boelens W.C.", "AuthorID": "7003921720", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "55542747100": {"Name": "Kondrat F.D.L.", "AuthorID": "55542747100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical & Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "16401348000": {"Name": "Hilton G.R.", "AuthorID": "16401348000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical & Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "7003428980": {"Name": "Benesch J.L.P.", "AuthorID": "7003428980", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical & Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "56841256100": {"Name": "Ray N.J.", "AuthorID": "56841256100", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University"}, "7102839510": {"Name": "Carver J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102839510", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University"}}}
