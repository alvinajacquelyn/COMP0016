It offers the potential to support information flow, collaboration and dialogue among professional and non-professional participants. Using semi-structured interviews and case studies, this research investigated the relationship between open science and public engagement. This article concentrates on three particular areas of concern that emerged: first, how to effectively contextualise and narrate information to render it accessible, as opposed to simply available; second, concerns about data quantity and quality; and third, concerns about the skills required for effective contextualisation, mapping and interpretation of information.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Open science", "Public engagement", "Science communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Community Participation", "Information Dissemination", "Science"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919937445", "SubjectAreas": [["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"55365485800": {"Name": "Grand A.", "AuthorID": "55365485800", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Science Communication Unit, University of the West of England"}, "57208031017": {"Name": "Wilkinson C.", "AuthorID": "57208031017", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of the West of England"}, "7006158694": {"Name": "Winfield A.", "AuthorID": "7006158694", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "University of the West of England"}, "6506746124": {"Name": "Bultitude K.", "AuthorID": "6506746124", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}}}
