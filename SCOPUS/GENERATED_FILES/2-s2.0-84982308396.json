The critical political situation in the country urges the development of cultural heritage management policies in order to protect it more thoroughly and consistently. Moving on from the numerous international initiatives and projects dealing with a mostly \u201cremote\u201d approach to the issue, the project here presented to engages with staff members of the Department of Antiquities (DoA) in the development of a joint strategy for the application of remote sensing and geographical information systems (GIS) to the preservation and monitoring of Libyan cultural heritage. A series of training courses resulted in an initial development of new ways of recording and analysing field data for a better awareness of the full range of threats that the archaeology of the country is subject to. Focussing on the case of the Jebel Nafusa, the training involved the assessment of site visibility on satellite imagery, the analysis of high-resolution satellite datasets for archaeological mapping, the creation of a GIS spatial database of field data, and the mapping of risks and threats to archaeology from remote sensing data. This led to the creation of of a risk map showing the areas that are affected by a number of threats, thus giving the DoA a tool to prioritise future fieldwork to keep the assessment of site damage up to date. Only a collaborative approach can lead to a sustainable strategy for the protection of the invaluable cultural heritage of Libya.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cultural heritage", "GIS", "Jebel Nafusa", "Libya", "Remote sensing", "Risks mapping"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982308396", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"57190689303": {"Name": "Nebbia M.", "AuthorID": "57190689303", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Durham University"}, "36771180400": {"Name": "Leone A.", "AuthorID": "36771180400", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176037", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Durham University"}, "56498831100": {"Name": "Bockmann R.", "AuthorID": "56498831100", "AffiliationID": "60159392", "AffiliationName": "Deutsches Arch\u00e4ologisches Institut \u2013 Rome Department"}, "57190687705": {"Name": "Hddad M.", "AuthorID": "57190687705", "AffiliationID": "114190866", "AffiliationName": "Department of History, Tarhuna University"}, "55959981500": {"Name": "Abdouli H.", "AuthorID": "55959981500", "AffiliationID": "60064746", "AffiliationName": "Department of History, Faculty of Arts of the University of Sfax"}, "57190684400": {"Name": "Masoud A.M.", "AuthorID": "57190684400", "AffiliationID": "117160955", "AffiliationName": "Department of Antiquities of Tripolitania \u2013 Centre for Documentation and Digitalization of Heritage"}, "57190687702": {"Name": "Elkendi N.M.", "AuthorID": "57190687702", "AffiliationID": "117160955", "AffiliationName": "Department of Antiquities of Tripolitania \u2013 Centre for Documentation and Digitalization of Heritage"}, "57190687884": {"Name": "Hamoud H.M.", "AuthorID": "57190687884", "AffiliationID": "117160955", "AffiliationName": "Department of Antiquities of Tripolitania \u2013 Centre for Documentation and Digitalization of Heritage"}, "57190683383": {"Name": "Adam S.S.", "AuthorID": "57190683383", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Antiquities of Cyrenaica"}, "57190686814": {"Name": "Khatab M.N.", "AuthorID": "57190686814", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Antiquities of Cyrenaica"}}}
