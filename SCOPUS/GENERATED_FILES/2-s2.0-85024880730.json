For permission to use (where not already granted under a licence) please go to http://www.bmj.com/company/products-services/rights-and-licensing/.Although a great deal of paediatric consultations are not urgent, doctors in training spend so much time providing service for acute conditions that they spend little time focusing on outpatient work before they become a consultant. Engaging clinicians in the managerial aspects of providing clinical care is a key to improving outcomes, and this article addresses these aspects of the outpatient consultation from referral to discharge. We aim to provide doctors in training with a tool to use during their training and their first few years as a consultant, to think about how outpatient work is organised and how it can be improved to maximise patient experience. The non-urgent consultation varies across the world; this article is aimed to be relevant to an international audience.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Outpatients", "Patient Discharge", "Pediatrics", "Physicians", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Referral and Consultation", "United Kingdom", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024880730", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57199312393": {"Name": "Mitchell R.", "AuthorID": "57199312393", "AffiliationID": "60001497", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Lewisham"}, "56954691300": {"Name": "Gomez K.", "AuthorID": "56954691300", "AffiliationID": "60001497", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital Lewisham"}, "56650627200": {"Name": "Jacob H.", "AuthorID": "56650627200", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Whittington Hospital"}, "6507487426": {"Name": "Fertleman C.", "AuthorID": "6507487426", "AffiliationID": "60000641", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Whittington Hospital"}, "56754882900": {"Name": "Morrissey B.", "AuthorID": "56754882900", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Royal London Hospital"}, "55881227700": {"Name": "Macaulay C.", "AuthorID": "55881227700", "AffiliationID": "60107269", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Evelina Children's Hospital"}}}
