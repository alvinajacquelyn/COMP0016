Interstitial fluid pressure is often raised in solid tumors, which can limit drug delivery. To probe low-velocity flow in tumors resulting from raised interstitial fluid pressure, we developed a novel MRI technique named convection-MRI, which uses a phase-contrast acquisition with a dual-inversion vascular nulling preparation to separate intra- and extravascular flow. Here, we report the results of experiments in flow phantoms, numerical simulations, and tumor xenograft models to investigate the technical feasibility of convection-MRI. We observed a significant correlation between estimates of effective fluid pressure from convection-MRI with gold-standard, invasive measurements of interstitial fluid pressure in mouse models of human colorectal carcinoma. Our results show how convection-MRI can provide insights into the growth and responsiveness to vascular-targeting therapy in colorectal cancers. Significance: A noninvasive method for measuring low-velocity fluid flow caused by raised fluid pressure can be used to assess changes caused by therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Extracellular Fluid", "Humans", "Hydrodynamics", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Mice", "Mice, Nude", "Models, Biological", "Neovascularization, Pathologic", "Phantoms, Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047870125", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"37064431400": {"Name": "Burrell J.S.", "AuthorID": "37064431400", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7402674201": {"Name": "Robinson S.P.", "AuthorID": "7402674201", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Division of Radiotherapy and Imaging, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "57037614100": {"Name": "Johnson S.P.", "AuthorID": "57037614100", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "12142084100": {"Name": "Barbara Pedley R.", "AuthorID": "12142084100", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "22951848300": {"Name": "Pendse D.", "AuthorID": "22951848300", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "University College Hospital"}, "57203674289": {"Name": "Walker-Samuel S.", "AuthorID": "57203674289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London, Division of Medicine, Lower Ground Floor, Paul O'Gorman Building"}, "55875686000": {"Name": "Roberts T.A.", "AuthorID": "55875686000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London, Division of Medicine, Lower Ground Floor, Paul O'Gorman Building"}, "55780918900": {"Name": "Ramasawmy R.", "AuthorID": "55780918900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London, Division of Medicine, Lower Ground Floor, Paul O'Gorman Building"}, "36088022100": {"Name": "Siow B.M.", "AuthorID": "36088022100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London, Division of Medicine, Lower Ground Floor, Paul O'Gorman Building"}, "7202589253": {"Name": "Richardson S.", "AuthorID": "7202589253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London, Division of Medicine, Lower Ground Floor, Paul O'Gorman Building"}, "55929688900": {"Name": "Gon\u00e7alves M.R.", "AuthorID": "55929688900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London, Division of Medicine, Lower Ground Floor, Paul O'Gorman Building"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, University College London, Division of Medicine, Lower Ground Floor, Paul O'Gorman Building"}}}
