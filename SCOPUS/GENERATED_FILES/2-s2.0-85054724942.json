Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.Purpose:Tubercular retinal vasculitis (TRV) is a heterogeneous disease that can be difficult to manage because of nonspecific presentation and limitations of confirmatory tests for tuberculosis. This is a big data analysis on phenotypes and treatment outcomes for TRV.Methods:Multicentre retrospective study of patients with TRV between January 2004 and December 2014 and a minimum follow-up of 1 year.Results:Two hundred and fifty-one patients with TRV with a mean age of 38.9 \u00b1 14.4 years (range, 9-86 years) were included. The patients were predominantly males (n = 167/251; 66.5%) of Asian ethnicity (n = 174/246; 70.7%), and geographical origin (n = 137/251; 54.6%). Most patients had features of occlusive type of RV (n = 113/185; 61.1%) except Caucasians (n = 11; 28.2%). There was no significant difference in treatment failure whether patients received antitubercular therapy (ATT) (P = 0.29), although treatment failure was less frequent in patients who received ATT (13.6%; n = 31/228) compared with those who did not (21.7%, n = 5/23). Less treatment failures were observed in patients with occlusive type RV who received ATT; however, this was not significant on survival analysis (P = 0.09). Treatment with ATT was associated with higher failure rates in patients of Hispanic and African American race and those with TRV associated with panuveitis (compared with posterior uveitis).Conclusion:In this multinational study of TRV, there was no significant therapeutic effect of ATT. However, a definitive conclusion about the role of ATT could not be made because of a few patients who did not receive ATT. Because this is a retrospective study with a limited 1-year follow-up, the effect of ATT may have been overestimated (or underestimated) in the duration of follow-up.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antitubercular therapy", "ocular", "retinal vasculitis", "tuberculosis", "uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antitubercular Agents", "Child", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Recurrence", "Retinal Vasculitis", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Tuberculosis, Ocular", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054724942", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"57039908700": {"Name": "Gunasekeran D.V.", "AuthorID": "57039908700", "AffiliationID": "60017161", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, National University of Singapore"}, "7201475180": {"Name": "Agrawal R.", "AuthorID": "7201475180", "AffiliationID": "60024285", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Eye Research Institute"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57209565397": {"Name": "Agarwal A.", "AuthorID": "57209565397", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Eye Centre, Department of Ophthalmology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"}, "57198315222": {"Name": "Aggarwal K.", "AuthorID": "57198315222", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Eye Centre, Department of Ophthalmology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"}, "35452834800": {"Name": "Gupta V.", "AuthorID": "35452834800", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Eye Centre, Department of Ophthalmology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"}, "36494045500": {"Name": "Carre\u00f1o E.", "AuthorID": "36494045500", "AffiliationID": "60016719", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Bristol Eye Hospital"}, "6701749325": {"Name": "Raje D.", "AuthorID": "6701749325", "AffiliationID": "113030176", "AffiliationName": "MDS Bioanalytics"}, "57189021157": {"Name": "Kon O.M.", "AuthorID": "57189021157", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60022871", "AffiliationName": "Chest and Allergy Clinic, St Mary's Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55666336400": {"Name": "Nguyen Q.D.", "AuthorID": "55666336400", "AffiliationID": "60032838", "AffiliationName": "Byers Eye Institute, Department of Ophthalmology, Stanford University School of Medicine"}}}
