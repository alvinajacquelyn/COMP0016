Objective: We compared outcomes of AAD and/or \u03b2-blocker (BB) therapy with those of VT ablation (with AAD/BB) in patients with ARVC who had recurrent VT. Methods: In a multicenter retrospective study, 110 patients with ARVC (mean age 38 \u00b1 17 years; 91[83%] men) with a minimum of 3 VT episodes were included; 77 (70%) were initially treated with AAD/BB and 32 (29%) underwent ablation. Subsequently, 43 of the 77 patients treated with AAD/BB alone also underwent ablation. Overall, 75 patients underwent ablation. Results: When comparing initial AAD/BB therapy (n = 77) and VT ablation (n = 32) after \u22653 VT episodes, a single ablation procedure rendered 35% of patients free of VT at 3 years compared with 28% of AAD/BB-only\u2013treated patients (P =.46). Of the 77 AAD/BB-only\u2013treated patients, 43 subsequently underwent ablation. For all 75 patients who underwent ablation, 56% were VT-free at 3 years after the last ablation procedure. Epicardial ablation was used in 40/75 (53%) and was associated with lower VT recurrence after the last ablation procedure (endocardial/epicardial vs endocardial-only; 71% vs 47% 3-year VT-free survival; P =.05). Importantly, there was no difference in survival free of death or transplantation between the ablation- and AAD/BB-only\u2013treated patients (P =.61). Conclusion: In patients with ARVC and a high VT burden, mortality and transplantation-free survival are not significantly different between drug- and ablation-treated patients. These patients have a high risk of recurrent VT despite drug therapy. Combined endocardial/epicardial ablation is associated with reduced VT recurrence as compared with endocardial-only ablation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy", "Catheter ablation", "Ventricular tachycardia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Adult", "Anti-Arrhythmia Agents", "Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia", "Catheter Ablation", "Epicardial Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Tachycardia, Ventricular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062956299", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"34771700600": {"Name": "Mahida S.", "AuthorID": "34771700600", "AffiliationID": "60030565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital"}, "8410075100": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "8410075100", "AffiliationID": "60004437", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Westmead Hospital"}, "54923068800": {"Name": "Baldinger S.H.", "AuthorID": "54923068800", "AffiliationID": "60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital"}, "55879054500": {"Name": "Tedrow U.B.", "AuthorID": "55879054500", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Unit, Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "35477287900": {"Name": "John R.M.", "AuthorID": "35477287900", "AffiliationID": "60016782", "AffiliationName": "Arrhythmia Unit, Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital"}, "54952429200": {"Name": "Venlet J.", "AuthorID": "54952429200", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "8970255600": {"Name": "Zeppenfeld K.", "AuthorID": "8970255600", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "23095299100": {"Name": "Saguner A.M.", "AuthorID": "23095299100", "AffiliationID": "121598964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Heart Center Zurich"}, "7007038406": {"Name": "Duru F.", "AuthorID": "7007038406", "AffiliationID": "121598964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Heart Center Zurich"}, "16416980100": {"Name": "AbdelWahab A.", "AuthorID": "16416980100", "AffiliationID": "60000540, 60023750", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre"}, "57203056417": {"Name": "Sapp J.L.", "AuthorID": "57203056417", "AffiliationID": "60000540, 60023750", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre"}, "55318143300": {"Name": "Castelletti S.", "AuthorID": "55318143300", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias of Genetic Origin, Istituto Auxologico Italiano \u201cSan Carlo,\u201d"}, "6508359030": {"Name": "Pantazis A.", "AuthorID": "6508359030", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56672467900": {"Name": "McKenna W.J.", "AuthorID": "56672467900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Electrophysiology, The Heart Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35254420400": {"Name": "Stevenson W.G.", "AuthorID": "35254420400", "AffiliationID": "60030769", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular Division, Vanderbilt University Medical Center"}}}
