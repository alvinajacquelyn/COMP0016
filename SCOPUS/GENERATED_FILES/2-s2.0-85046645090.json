Ethanol reacted through dehydration (major) and dehydrogenation (minor) pathways on TiO2 and Au/TiO2 producing ethylene and acetaldehyde, with negligible hydrogen formation. On Pd/TiO2 and Au\u2013Pd/TiO2, carbon monoxide and methane were the main products, through C\u2013C bond cleavage, in addition to H2. TPD of ethanol on Au-Pd was almost identical to that of Pd indicating the much higher activity of Pd when compared to Au on TiO2. Ethanol desorption from all catalysts followed second order kinetics as evidenced from desorption peak shape, shift in peak temperatures with increasing initial coverages, and by data fitting of the Arrhenius plots. With increasing ethanol coverage, the activation energies calculated from the non-linear fitting of Polanyi Wigner equation as well as from leading edge analysis decreases due to repulsive lateral interactions. Both methods gave similar results (activation energy between 145 and 95 kJ/mol depending on the surface coverage), although the activation energy obtained by the leading edge method was more sensitive to surface coverage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Activation energy", "Au\u2013Pd/TiO2", "Carbon\u2013Carbon bond cleavage", "Ethanol-dehydration", "Ethanol-dehydrogenation", "Ethanol-TPD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon bond", "Ethanol dehydration", "Ethanol dehydrogenation", "High-vacuum conditions", "Lateral interactions", "Pd/TiO2", "Products distributions", "Second order kinetics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046645090", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56900735700": {"Name": "Bashir S.", "AuthorID": "56900735700", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SABIC Corporate Research and Development (CRD) Center at KAUST"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SABIC Corporate Research and Development (CRD) Center at KAUST"}}}
