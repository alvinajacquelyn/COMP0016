To be specific, we first provide a cross-layer de-sign analysis to obtain the achievable throughput using the TDD mode for transmission in LTE-A system. Under par-Ticular QoS requirements and certain channel conditions, the achievable throughput is derived and evaluated. The QoS requirements originate from the upper layers, where the file size, the TCP window size and the latency for efficient transmission are incorporated in the final formulation. Having obtained the formulation, simulation results high-light the impact of the QoS parameters to different TDD frame formats. We therefore propose a framework for TDD frame adaptation within the LTE-A system. The aim of this framework is to provide the options of choosing different TDD frame formats by calculating the DL:UL subframes ra-Tio under certain channel conditions and QoS requirements. Simulation results are carried out, which reveal the proba-bility of choosing the different TDD frame formats from the system under certain channel conditions and QoS require-ments. c 2017 ACM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-layer design", "Dual connectivity", "FDD.-TDD carrier aggregation", "LTE-Advanced", "TDD frame adaptation."], "IndexKeywords": ["Carrier aggregations", "Cross-layer design", "Dual connectivity", "Lte- advanced", "TDD frame adaptation"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038970795", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55608777700": {"Name": "Xenakis A.", "AuthorID": "55608777700", "AffiliationID": "119954943", "AffiliationName": "Athena Research and Innovation Center Platani, PATRAS"}, "55952568500": {"Name": "Foukalas F.", "AuthorID": "55952568500", "AffiliationID": "119954943", "AffiliationName": "Athena Research and Innovation Center Platani, PATRAS"}}}
