Methods: 51 UK EEG departments participated in the prospective study. A pro-forma was completed for all consecutive patients aged 5 years and over referred for EEG over a six month period. Information obtained included referral diagnosis, occurrence/type of attack during EEG, the use of suggestion, length of recording and who was present during the EEG. Results: 11,298 patients were entered into the study. 376 psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) occurred of which 337 were considered to be of the habitual type. In those patients suspected of having NEAD prior to referral, the use of verbal suggestion increased the yield of habitual attacks by a factor of three in both adults and children. Using suggestive techniques twice, improved the yield further. Non-habitual attacks occurred equally whether or not suggestion was used. At least 90% of habitual PNES occurred within the first 30 min of recording even in those patients having prolonged EEGs. In EEGs where additional professional personnel were present, PNES occurred more frequently. Conclusion: This large multicentre study provides evidence to inform recommendations for EEG to investigate NEAD. We recommend the use of verbal suggestion at least twice and where practical the presence of additional professional staff. A thirty minute recording is sufficient to record a habitual PNES in most instances.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EEG", "Epilepsy", "Non-epileptic attack disorder", "Provocation techniques", "Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures", "Suggestive techniques"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Child, Preschool", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Referral and Consultation", "Seizures", "Suggestion", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041378664", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6603540782": {"Name": "Kandler R.", "AuthorID": "6603540782", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "55922680200": {"Name": "Lawrence S.", "AuthorID": "55922680200", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "55844957400": {"Name": "Pang C.", "AuthorID": "55844957400", "AffiliationID": "60012191", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "55845226300": {"Name": "Lai M.", "AuthorID": "55845226300", "AffiliationID": "60024240", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Royal Victoria Infirmary"}, "37121242300": {"Name": "Whitehead K.", "AuthorID": "37121242300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
