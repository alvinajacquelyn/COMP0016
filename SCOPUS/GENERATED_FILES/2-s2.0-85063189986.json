It suggests that the global mathematics attainment \u2018spotlight\u2019, and the English policy context in particular, offer both opportunities and constraints for the development of such a high-quality mathematics education. The article also discusses the challenging implications for the curriculum, and for the nature of teacher expertise, particularly subject-specific expertise, that is needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human flourishing", "Mathematics education", "Powerful knowledge", "Qualification", "Socialization", "Subjectification"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063189986", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57189348176": {"Name": "Golding J.", "AuthorID": "57189348176", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
