It addresses the implications of an initiative to promote patient involvement in government-funded research in the context of a large cancer research network in England. We employ a socio-spatial theoretical framework inspired by insights from Henri Lefebvre and Judith Butler to examine how professional researchers, doctors and patients understand and perform accountability in an empirical context. Our data reveal fundamental tensions between formally required and routinely enacted dimensions of accountability as these are experienced by patients. Consequently, our analysis argues for a need to challenge abstract, professionalized discourse about accountability in health services by acknowledging embodied spaces of representation, in which patients themselves can contribute to making participatory accountability a reality. We suggest that such a shift will provide a more rounded appraisal of patient experiences within health research, and health systems more widely.", "AuthorKeywords": ["accountability spaces", "citizen participation", "ethnography", "health research", "Henri Lefebvre", "Judith Butler", "patient experience", "performativity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049894203", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"24465568100": {"Name": "Komporozos-Athanasiou A.", "AuthorID": "24465568100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7404620889": {"Name": "Thompson M.", "AuthorID": "7404620889", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "14046809700": {"Name": "Fotaki M.", "AuthorID": "14046809700", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}}}
