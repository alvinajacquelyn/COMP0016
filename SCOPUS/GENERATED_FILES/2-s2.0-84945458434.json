Psychology and Psychotherapy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the British Psychological Society.Objectives The clinical significance of self-criticism and self-compassion has prompted the development of questionnaires assessing these constructs. However, there is a lack of measures assessing their interaction within specific contexts and potential involvement in mood repair processes. Design To rectify this, we developed the Self-Compassion and Self-Criticism Scales (SCCS), based on responses to specific scenarios, and examined its psychometric properties in an online survey and an experimental situation. Method In study 1, standard psychometric procedures were used to investigate the reliability and validity of the SCCS. In study 2, an experimental challenge involving a difficult language task was used to test its sensitivity to change. Results In study 1, exploratory factor analysis (n = 413) showed a clear two-factor structure of the SCCS denoting two orthogonal scales, with high internal validity (\u03b1 \u2265.87). Correlations between the SCCS and existing measures also demonstrated appropriate convergent validity. Study 2 (n = 90) provided preliminary evidence that the SCCS can detect changes in self-appraisals. Participants receiving no performance feedback from the challenge task showed reduced state self-criticism and increased state self-compassion, demonstrating mood repair. Conclusions The SCCS has promise as a situational measure of self-compassion and self-criticism. Practitioner points In the context of specific problem situations, clients' levels of self-criticism and self-compassion may well be orthogonal and can be assessed with the SCCS. In setting treatment goals and assessing treatment outcome, it may be helpful to target both self-compassion and self-criticism separately.", "AuthorKeywords": ["feedback", "mood repair", "self-compassion", "self-criticism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Affect", "Depression", "Empathy", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self-Assessment", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945458434", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55175472000": {"Name": "Falconer C.", "AuthorID": "55175472000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7404245327": {"Name": "King J.", "AuthorID": "7404245327", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7006656085": {"Name": "Brewin C.", "AuthorID": "7006656085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
