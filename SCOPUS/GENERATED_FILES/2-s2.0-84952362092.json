All rights reserved.Congenital visual or hearing impairment challenges all aspects of development from the earliest days of life and is accompanied by risk of poor psycho-social adjustment and psychological wellbeing. The visually impaired child is particularly vulnerable in the social communicative and adaptive behavioural domain whereas language-related abilities are most affected in hearing impaired children. These aspects and other developmental and psychiatric risks are explored in the chapter. However, individual children vary greatly and individual progress depends on the interplay of multiple factors. The evidence for risk factors at neurobiological, sensory, cognitive, behavioural to environmental level (including psychosocial, educational and cultural) is described further. Some children show exceptional developmental progress and psychological resilience and current knowledge of protective factors is presented. From a clinical perspective, an understanding of both the risk and protective factors is essential for establishing tailored preventative and interventionist approaches and therapeutic goals which will enable affected children to reach their potential and enhance their wellbeing and reduce psychiatric risks. Strategies for management of care and support for children, young people and their families are described.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autism", "Behaviour", "Cognition", "Communication", "Hearing impairment", "Language", "Psychological adjustment", "Visual impairment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952362092", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7005776986": {"Name": "Dale N.", "AuthorID": "7005776986", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}, "36758693900": {"Name": "Edwards L.", "AuthorID": "36758693900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
