Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Summary: Genomewide position-specific scores, such as those estimating conservation, constraint, fitness or mutation tolerance, are ubiquitous in current genome analyses. The diversity of sources and formats of these scores, as well as their size, increase the burden to use them. We present GenomicScores, a Bioconductor package that provides efficient storage and seamless access of genomewide position-specific scores from R, facilitating their use in genome analysis workflows.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Genome", "Genomics", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061704371", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57204243502": {"Name": "Puigdevall P.", "AuthorID": "57204243502", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "6601957393": {"Name": "Castelo R.", "AuthorID": "6601957393", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}}}
