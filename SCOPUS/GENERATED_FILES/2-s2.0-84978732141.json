We here report on the progression of NMSs over 4 years from diagnosis in a cohort of de-novo, previously untreated, patients with PD. Methods: Consecutive de-novo (disease duration < 2 years), untreated patients with PD were enrolled in this observational study. Evaluations were then scheduled every 2 years and included assessment of motor and non-motor features as well as of quality of life measures. Results: Sixty-one patients were prospectively followed-up for 4 years from diagnosis. The majority of NMSs increased over time and significantly affected quality of life, whereas motor disability did not. There was no significant association between NMSs and dopaminergic therapy in terms of both drug class and total levodopa-equivalent daily dosage. Excessive daytime sleepiness was the only NMS correlating with therapy with dopamine agonists. Female patients were more likely to have worse quality of life. Conclusions: Non-motor symptoms significantly increase over time, with a different progression rate for each one. NMSs significantly affect quality of life in PD and we here demonstrated that this was especially the case when patients were in their (motor) honeymoon period. Future trials should target non-dopaminergic networks and consider NMSs in their outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["gender", "honeymoon", "non-motor", "Parkinson", "progression", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Progression", "Dopamine Agonists", "Female", "Humans", "Levodopa", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Parkinson Disease", "Quality of Life", "Severity of Illness Index", "Sex Factors", "Symptom Assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978732141", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36008087300": {"Name": "Erro R.", "AuthorID": "36008087300", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Biomedicine and Movement Science, University of Verona"}, "24172711500": {"Name": "Picillo M.", "AuthorID": "24172711500", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, Center for Neurodegenerative diseases (CEMAND), Neuroscience Section, University of Salerno"}, "7007039088": {"Name": "Pellecchia M.T.", "AuthorID": "7007039088", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, Center for Neurodegenerative diseases (CEMAND), Neuroscience Section, University of Salerno"}, "7102266387": {"Name": "Barone P.", "AuthorID": "7102266387", "AffiliationID": "60007061", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Surgery, Center for Neurodegenerative diseases (CEMAND), Neuroscience Section, University of Salerno"}, "7005091688": {"Name": "Vitale C.", "AuthorID": "7005091688", "AffiliationID": "112593698", "AffiliationName": "IDC-Hermitage-Capodimonte"}, "16232509200": {"Name": "Amboni M.", "AuthorID": "16232509200", "AffiliationID": "112593698", "AffiliationName": "IDC-Hermitage-Capodimonte"}, "36461391900": {"Name": "Moccia M.", "AuthorID": "36461391900", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Reproductive and Odontostomatologic Sciences, University of Naples Federico II"}, "7006968775": {"Name": "Santangelo G.", "AuthorID": "7006968775", "AffiliationID": "60026777", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Second University of Naples"}}}
