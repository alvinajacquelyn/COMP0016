Herein, a facile, easily scalable technique is reported to fabricate white-light-activated bactericidal surfaces by incorporating zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles and crystal violet (CV) dye into poly(dimethylsiloxane). The effect of ZnO concentration on photobactericidal activity of CV is investigated, and we show that there is synergy between ZnO and CV. These materials showed highly significant antibacterial activity when tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli under white light conditions. These surfaces have potential to be used in healthcare environments to decrease the impact of HAIs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044210527", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56395043500": {"Name": "Ozkan E.", "AuthorID": "56395043500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
