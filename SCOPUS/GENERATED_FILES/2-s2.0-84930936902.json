The ASIC can deliver up to 1 mA fully programmable monophasic or biphasic stimulus current pulses, to 13 electrodes selected in any possible configuration. It also supports interleaved stimulation. Communication is achieved via only 3 wires. The current source and the control of the stimulation timing were kept off-chip to reduce the heat dissipation close to the spinal cord. The ASIC was designed in a 0.18-\\mum high voltage CMOS process. Its output voltage compliance can be up to 25 V. It features a small core area (< 0.36 mm2) and consumes a maximum of 114 \u03bcW during a full stimulation cycle. The layout of the ASIC was developed to be suitable for integration on the epidural electrode array, and two different versions were fabricated and electrically tested. Results from both versions were almost indistinguishable. The performance of the system was verified for different loads and stimulation parameters. Its suitability to drive a passive epidural 12-electrode array in saline has also been demonstrated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)", "electrode array", "electrode driver", "epidural stimulation", "implantable electronics", "low power", "rats"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical stimulations", "Electrode arrays", "epidural stimulation", "Fully programmables", "High voltage CMOS process", "Implantable electronics", "Low Power", "Stimulation parameters", "Animals", "Electric Stimulation", "Equipment Design", "Implantable Neurostimulators", "Rats", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Spinal Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930936902", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56180718800": {"Name": "Giagka V.", "AuthorID": "56180718800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "23008354200": {"Name": "Eder C.", "AuthorID": "23008354200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15723130500": {"Name": "Donaldson N.", "AuthorID": "15723130500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}}}
