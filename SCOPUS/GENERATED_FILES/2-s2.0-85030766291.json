The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We present an optical eclipse observation of the hot Jupiter WASP-12b using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. These spectra allow us to place an upper limit of Ag < 0.064 (97.5% confidence level) on the planet's white light geometric albedo across 290-570 nm. Using six wavelength bins across the same wavelength range also produces stringent limits on the geometric albedo for all bins. However, our uncertainties in eclipse depth are \u223c40% greater than the Poisson limit and may be limited by the intrinsic variability of the Sun-like host star - the solar luminosity is known to vary at the 10-4 level on a timescale of minutes. We use our eclipse depth limits to test two previously suggested atmospheric models for this planet: Mie scattering from an aluminum-oxide haze or cloud-free Rayleigh scattering. Our stringent nondetection rules out both models and is consistent with thermal emission plus weak Rayleigh scattering from atomic hydrogen and helium. Our results are in stark contrast with those for the much cooler HD 189733b, the only other hot Jupiter with spectrally resolved reflected light observations; those data showed an increase in albedo with decreasing wavelength. The fact that the first two exoplanets with optical albedo spectra exhibit significant differences demonstrates the importance of spectrally resolved reflected light observations and highlights the great diversity among hot Jupiters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["planets and satellites: atmospheres", "stars: individual (WASP-12)", "techniques: photometric"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030766291", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57195994645": {"Name": "Bell T.J.", "AuthorID": "57195994645", "AffiliationID": "60193861, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "McGill Space Institute, Institute for Research on Exoplanets"}, "16309079300": {"Name": "Cowan N.B.", "AuthorID": "16309079300", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, McGill University"}, "56645462400": {"Name": "Schwartz J.C.", "AuthorID": "56645462400", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, McGill University"}, "36627560700": {"Name": "Nikolov N.", "AuthorID": "36627560700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "35314666000": {"Name": "Evans T.M.", "AuthorID": "35314666000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "15838180100": {"Name": "Sing D.K.", "AuthorID": "15838180100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}, "55660948300": {"Name": "Barstow J.K.", "AuthorID": "55660948300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55958101800": {"Name": "Barman T.S.", "AuthorID": "55958101800", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona"}, "57190218925": {"Name": "Lothringer J.D.", "AuthorID": "57190218925", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona"}, "14629833700": {"Name": "Crossfield I.J.M.", "AuthorID": "14629833700", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "34769688700": {"Name": "Gibson N.P.", "AuthorID": "34769688700", "AffiliationID": "60029738", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Research Centre, School of Mathematics and Physics, Queens University Belfast"}, "12445686100": {"Name": "Knutson H.A.", "AuthorID": "12445686100", "AffiliationID": "60086312, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences, California Institute of Technology"}, "36118126800": {"Name": "Kataria T.", "AuthorID": "36118126800", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "52063171200": {"Name": "Benneke B.", "AuthorID": "52063171200", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}}}
