Modern dialysis machines can estimate clearances each session, so we wished to compare online measurements with standard Kt/Vurea. Methods: Urea clearance was estimated by intermittent changes in effective ionic dialysance and by continuous ultraviolet light absorption spent during the mid-week dialysis session. Total body water was calculated by the Watson equation and measured by multifrequency bioimpedance. Results: We compared Kt/Vurea measurements in 162 patients with online assessments: 38 by ultraviolet absorption and 124 by effective ionic dialysance (50 Fresenius 4008 and 74 Fresenius 5008). All online measurements overestimated single-pool Kt/Vurea (ultraviolet absorption mean bias 0.25 \u00b1 0.24, effective ionic dialysance 4008H 0.25 \u00b1 0.21 and 5008H 0.20 \u00b1 0.25; p < 0.001). However, there was no difference between dual-pool Kt/V and ultraviolet absorbance (1.28 \u00b1 0.26 vs 1.29 \u00b1 0.27) or by effective ionic dialysance with the 4008 (1.40 \u00b1 0.26 vs 1.46 \u00b1 0.33), although the effective ionic dialysance 5008 overestimated clearance (1.39 \u00b1 0.27 vs 1.31 \u00b1 0.22; p < 0.01). Similarly, with dual-pool Kt/Vurea, the mean bias for ultraviolet absorption was 0.08 \u00b1 0.35, for effective ionic dialysance (EID) 4008 was 0.13 \u00b1 0.55 and for EID 5008 was \u22120.2 \u00b1 0.36. Hence, the mean bias was greater with the EID 5008 compared to ultraviolet absorption (0.08 \u00b1 0.35 vs \u22120.2 \u00b1 0.36 vs p < 0.01). Conclusions: Online measurements allow dialysis adequacy to be measured every session. We found that although online clearances overestimated single-pool Kt/Vurea measurements, there were no significant differences between the continuous ultraviolet light absorbance method and intermittent effective ionic dialysance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adequacy", "Bioimpedance", "Clearance", "Haemodialysis", "Sodium", "Urea"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Blood Urea Nitrogen", "Female", "Humans", "Kinetics", "Male", "Metabolic Clearance Rate", "Middle Aged", "Renal Dialysis", "Retrospective Studies", "Urea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045268783", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57203348814": {"Name": "Mohamed A.", "AuthorID": "57203348814", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}, "55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Nephrology, Royal Free Hospital, University College London Medical School"}}}
