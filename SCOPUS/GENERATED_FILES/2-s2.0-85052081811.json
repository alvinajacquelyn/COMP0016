Recent Findings: The use of organoids for airway basal cells is routine. However, the development of organoids for the other regions of the lung is still in its infancy. Such cultures usually rely on cell-cell interactions between the stem cells and a putative niche cell for their growth and differentiation. Summary: The use of co-culture organoid systems has facilitated the in vitro cultivation of previously inaccessible stem cell populations, providing a novel method for dissecting the molecular requirements of these cell-cell interactions. Future technology development will allow the growth of epithelial-only organoids in more defined media and also the introduction of specific non-epithelial cells for the study of cell interactions. These developments will require an improved understanding of the epithelial and non-epithelial cell types present in the lung and their lineage relationships.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human lung", "iPSCs", "Lung progenitors", "Mouse lung", "Organoids"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052081811", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57202794185": {"Name": "Nikoli\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "57202794185", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}, "8526257400": {"Name": "Rawlins E.", "AuthorID": "8526257400", "AffiliationID": "60028377, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Gurdon Institute, University of Cambridge"}}}
