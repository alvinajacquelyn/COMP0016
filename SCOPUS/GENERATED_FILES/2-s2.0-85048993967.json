The recently characterized startle disease mouse mutant shaky carries a missense mutation (Q177K) in the \u03b28-\u03b29 loop within the large extracellular N-terminal domain of the GlyR \u03b11 subunit. This results in a disrupted hydrogen bond network around K177 and faster GlyR decay times. Symptoms in mice start at postnatal day 14 and increase until premature death of homozygous shaky mice around 4\u20136 weeks after birth. Here we investigate the in vivo functional effects of the Q177K mutation using behavioral analysis coupled to protein biochemistry and functional assays. Western blot analysis revealed GlyR \u03b11 subunit expression in wild-type and shaky animals around postnatal day 7, a week before symptoms in mutant mice become obvious. Before 2 weeks of age, homozygous shaky mice appeared healthy and showed no changes in body weight. However, analysis of gait and hind-limb clasping revealed that motor coordination was already impaired. Motor coordination and the activity pattern at P28 improved significantly upon diazepam treatment, a pharmacotherapy used in human startle disease. To investigate whether functional deficits in glycinergic neurotransmission are present prior to phenotypic onset, we performed whole-cell recordings fromhypoglossal motoneurons (HMs) in brain stem slices from wild-type and shaky mice at different postnatal stages. Shaky homozygotes showed a decline in mIPSC amplitude and frequency at P9-P13, progressing to significant reductions in mIPSC amplitude and decay time at P18-24 compared to wild-type littermates. Extrasynaptic GlyRs recorded by bath-application of glycine also revealed reduced current amplitudes in shaky mice compared to wild-type neurons, suggesting that presynaptic GlyR function is also impaired. Thus, a distinct, but behaviorally ineffective impairment of glycinergic synapses precedes the symptoms onset in shaky mice. These findings extend our current knowledge on startle disease in the shaky mouse model in that they demonstrate howthe progression of GlyR dysfunction causes, with a delay of about 1 week, the appearance of disease symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fast decay", "Glycine receptor", "Mouse model", "Shaky", "Startle disease", "\u03b28-\u03b29 loop"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048993967", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55420655000": {"Name": "Schaefer N.", "AuthorID": "55420655000", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "6603164094": {"Name": "Villmann C.", "AuthorID": "6603164094", "AffiliationID": "60012689", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical Neurobiology, Julius-Maximilians-University of W\u00fcrzburg"}, "37021903300": {"Name": "Zheng F.", "AuthorID": "37021903300", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "7004292958": {"Name": "van Brederode J.", "AuthorID": "7004292958", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "15030878900": {"Name": "Alzheimer C.", "AuthorID": "15030878900", "AffiliationID": "60000765", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg"}, "7402970504": {"Name": "Berger A.", "AuthorID": "7402970504", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "7006277578": {"Name": "Paige C.J.", "AuthorID": "7006277578", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto"}, "55848440600": {"Name": "Leacock S.", "AuthorID": "55848440600", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Pharmacology, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7202342650": {"Name": "Hirata H.", "AuthorID": "7202342650", "AffiliationID": "60012461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biological Science, College of Science and Engineering, Aoyama Gakuin University"}, "57203196300": {"Name": "Harvey R.J.", "AuthorID": "57203196300", "AffiliationID": "60159369", "AffiliationName": "Sunshine Coast Health Institute"}}}
