We demonstrate the imaging of dummy targets of varying conductivities placed in the proximity of the sensor, in an unshielded environment at room-temperature and without background subtraction. The images produced by the system accurately reproduce the characteristics of the actual objects. Furthermore, we perform finite element simulations in order to assess the potential for measuring low-conductivity biological tissues with our system. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of an instrument based on optical atomic magnetometers for magnetic induction tomography imaging of biological samples, in particular for mapping anomalous conductivity in the heart.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Magnetic Induction Tomography", "Medical Imaging", "Optical Atomic Magnetometers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anomalous conductivity", "Atomic magnetometers", "Atomic magnetometries", "Background subtraction", "Biological samples", "Finite element simulations", "Magnetic induction tomography", "Unshielded environment"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985019027", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57117691900": {"Name": "Deans C.", "AuthorID": "57117691900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23477770400": {"Name": "Marmugi L.", "AuthorID": "23477770400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57206413356": {"Name": "Hussain S.", "AuthorID": "57206413356", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603770390": {"Name": "Renzoni F.", "AuthorID": "6603770390", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
