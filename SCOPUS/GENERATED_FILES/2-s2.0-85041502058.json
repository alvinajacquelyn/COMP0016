Methods: Patients with SSc were treated for 48 weeks in an open-label extension phase of the faSScinate study with weekly 162 mg subcutaneous tocilizumab. Exploratory end points included modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS) and per cent predicted forced vital capacity (%pFVC) through week 96. Results: Overall, 24/44 (55%) placebo-tocilizumab and 27/43 (63%) continuous-tocilizumab patients completed week 96. Observed mean (SD (95% CI)) change from baseline in mRSS was -3.1 (6.3 (-5.4 to -0.9)) for placebo and -5.6 (9.1 (-8.9 to-2.4)) for tocilizumab at week 48 and -9.4 (5.6 (-8.9 to -2.4)) for placebo-tocilizumab and -9.1 (8.7 (-12.5 to -5.6)) for continuous-tocilizumab at week 96. Of patients who completed week 96, any decline in %pFVC was observed for 10/24 (42% (95% CI 22% to 63%)) placebotocilizumab and 12/26 (46% (95% CI 27% to 67%)) continuous-tocilizumab patients in the open-label period; no patients had >10% absolute decline in %pFVC. Serious infection rates/100 patient-years (95% CI) were 10.9 (3.0 to 27.9) with placebo and 34.8 (18.0 to 60.8) with tocilizumab during the double-blind period by week 48 and 19.6 (7.2 to 42.7) with placebo-tocilizumab and 0.0 (0.0 to 12.2) with continuous-tocilizumab during the open-label period. Conclusions: Skin score improvement and FVC stabilisation in the double-blind period were observed in placebo-treated patients who transitioned to tocilizumab and were maintained in the open-label period. Safety data indicated increased serious infections in patients with SSc but no new safety signals with tocilizumab.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Injections, Subcutaneous", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Scleroderma, Systemic", "Severity of Illness Index", "Skin", "Treatment Outcome", "Vital Capacity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041502058", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"24066781200": {"Name": "Khanna D.", "AuthorID": "24066781200", "AffiliationID": "60007200", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Scleroderma Program"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "University College London Medical School"}, "57200534741": {"Name": "Lin C.J.F.", "AuthorID": "57200534741", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech"}, "7403199141": {"Name": "Siegel J.", "AuthorID": "7403199141", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech"}, "8880273000": {"Name": "Jahreis A.", "AuthorID": "8880273000", "AffiliationID": "60026209", "AffiliationName": "Genentech"}, "57213878112": {"Name": "Van Laar J.M.", "AuthorID": "57213878112", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "22940566300": {"Name": "Frech T.M.", "AuthorID": "22940566300", "AffiliationID": "60025488, 60014232", "AffiliationName": "University of Utah, Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "7404766016": {"Name": "Anderson M.E.", "AuthorID": "7404766016", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60014875", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool, Aintree University Hospital"}, "25952078200": {"Name": "Baron M.", "AuthorID": "25952078200", "AffiliationID": "60018916", "AffiliationName": "Jewish General Hospital"}, "57207967935": {"Name": "Chung L.", "AuthorID": "57207967935", "AffiliationID": "60032838, 60014232", "AffiliationName": "Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto VA Health Care System"}, "7006196969": {"Name": "Fierlbeck G.", "AuthorID": "7006196969", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "7003584378": {"Name": "Lakshminarayanan S.", "AuthorID": "7003584378", "AffiliationID": "60000209", "AffiliationName": "University of Connecticut Health Center"}, "7003519327": {"Name": "Allanore Y.", "AuthorID": "7003519327", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Paris Descartes University"}, "57203074234": {"Name": "Pope J.E.", "AuthorID": "57203074234", "AffiliationID": "60031619, 60008242, 60010884", "AffiliationName": "Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Western Ontario, St Joseph's Health Care"}, "57203073213": {"Name": "Riemekasten G.", "AuthorID": "57203073213", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "University of L\u00fcbek, Charit\u00e9 University Hospital"}, "7005011211": {"Name": "Steen V.", "AuthorID": "7005011211", "AffiliationID": "60023927", "AffiliationName": "Georgetown University"}, "35371571700": {"Name": "M\u00fcller-Ladner U.", "AuthorID": "35371571700", "AffiliationID": "60017134, 60072281", "AffiliationName": "Justus-Liebig University Giessen, Kerckhoff Clinic"}, "57189061932": {"Name": "Spotswood H.", "AuthorID": "57189061932", "AffiliationID": "60001946", "AffiliationName": "Roche Products Ltd"}, "57197947885": {"Name": "Burke L.", "AuthorID": "57197947885", "AffiliationID": "60001946", "AffiliationName": "Roche Products Ltd"}, "7102326195": {"Name": "Furst D.E.", "AuthorID": "7102326195", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "University of California"}}}
