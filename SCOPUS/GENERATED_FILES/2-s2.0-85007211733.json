The analyses show 85 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), conservation with sequenced HHV-6A reference strain U1102, and closest identity to the recently determined GS strain, despite different geographic origins (United States and Gambia).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007211733", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"56494711700": {"Name": "Tweedy J.", "AuthorID": "56494711700", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of London"}, "56441755200": {"Name": "Spyrou M.A.", "AuthorID": "56441755200", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archeological Sciences, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "7004185781": {"Name": "Gompels U.A.", "AuthorID": "7004185781", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathogen Molecular Biology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of London"}, "56193808900": {"Name": "Donaldson C.D.", "AuthorID": "56193808900", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55800090700": {"Name": "Depledge D.", "AuthorID": "55800090700", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60176023", "AffiliationName": "MRC/UCL Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
