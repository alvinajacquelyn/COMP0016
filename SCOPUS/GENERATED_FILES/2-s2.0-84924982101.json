Methods IC-EEG implantation preparation entails first designing of the overall strategy of implantation (strategy) and second the precise details of implantation (planning). For each case, the multidisciplinary team made decisions on strategy and planning before the disclosure of multimodal brain imaging models. Any changes to decisions, following disclosure of the multimodal models, were recorded. Results Disclosure of 3DMMI led to a change in strategy in 15 (34%) of 44 individuals. The changes included addition and subtraction of electrodes, addition of grids, and going directly to resection. For the detailed surgical planning, 3DMMI led to a change in 35 (81%) of 43 individuals. Twenty-five (100%) of 25 patients undergoing stereo-EEG (SEEG) underwent a change in electrode placement, with 158 (75%) of 212 electrode trajectories being altered. Significance The use of 3DMMI makes substantial changes in clinical decision making.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epilepsy surgery", "Image integration", "Presurgical evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924982101", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"34067763300": {"Name": "Nowell M.", "AuthorID": "34067763300", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "35307885500": {"Name": "Rodionov R.", "AuthorID": "35307885500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "24172309000": {"Name": "Winston G.", "AuthorID": "24172309000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Medical Imaging and Computing, UCL"}, "56950315900": {"Name": "Kinghorn J.", "AuthorID": "56950315900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55913795300": {"Name": "Wehner T.", "AuthorID": "55913795300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57215499053": {"Name": "Miserocchi A.", "AuthorID": "57215499053", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.W.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "36538645500": {"Name": "Zombori G.", "AuthorID": "36538645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Medical Imaging and Computing, UCL"}, "57219298090": {"Name": "Sparks R.", "AuthorID": "57219298090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Medical Imaging and Computing, UCL"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Medical Imaging and Computing, UCL"}}}
