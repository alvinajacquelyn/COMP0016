Methods: The sequence utilized spiral trajectories with an acquisition strategy that allowed a combination of temporal encoding (Unaliasing by fourier-encoding the overlaps using the temporal dimension; UNFOLD) and parallel imaging (Sensitivity encoding; SENSE) to be used (UNFOLDed-SENSE). An in silico experiment was performed to determine the optimum UNFOLD filter. In vitro experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of time intervals calculation and peak mean velocity quantification. In addition, 15 healthy volunteers were imaged with the new sequence, and cardiac time intervals were compared to reference standard Doppler echocardiography measures. For comparison, in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experiments were also carried out using sliding window reconstructions. Results: The in vitro experiments demonstrated good agreement between real-time spiral UNFOLDed-SENSE phase contrast MR and the reference standard measurements of velocity and time intervals. The protocol was successfully performed in all volunteers. Subsequent measurement of time intervals produced values in keeping with literature values and good agreement with the gold standard echocardiography. Importantly, the proposed UNFOLDed-SENSE sequence outperformed the sliding window reconstructions. Conclusion: Cardiac time intervals can be successfully assessed with UNFOLDed-SENSE real-time spiral phase contrast. Real-time MR assessment of cardiac time intervals may be beneficial in assessment of patients with cardiac conditions such as diastolic dysfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac timing intervals", "Real-time spiral PC-MR", "UNFOLD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acquisition strategies", "Diastolic dysfunction", "Doppler echocardiography", "High temporal resolution", "Real time", "Sensitivity encoding", "Timing interval", "UNFOLD", "Adult", "Aged", "Algorithms", "Artifacts", "Computer Systems", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Image Enhancement", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reference Values", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921436734", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"6602362169": {"Name": "Kowalik G.T.", "AuthorID": "6602362169", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging"}, "55589453200": {"Name": "Knight D.S.", "AuthorID": "55589453200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "36605240600": {"Name": "Steeden J.A.", "AuthorID": "36605240600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging"}, "24339325500": {"Name": "Tann O.", "AuthorID": "24339325500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57195810900": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "57195810900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiorespiratory Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "24463413800": {"Name": "Odille F.", "AuthorID": "24463413800", "AffiliationID": "60104289", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine"}, "7202372276": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "7202372276", "AffiliationID": "60182839, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL Division of Medicine"}}}
