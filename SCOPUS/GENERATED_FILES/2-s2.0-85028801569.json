Here we investigate whether changes in the metabolic profile of PCOS women are driven by increased tendency to obesity or are specific features of PCOS related to increased testosterone levels.Design and methods:We conducted an NMR metabolomics association study of PCOS cases (n=145) and controls (n=687) nested in a population-based birth cohort (n=3127). Subjects were 31 years old at examination. The main analyses were adjusted for waist circumference (WC) as a proxy measure of central obesity. Subsequently, metabolite concentrations were compared between cases and controls within pre-defined WC strata. In each stratum, additional metabolomics association analyses with testosterone levels were conducted separately among cases and controls.Results:Overall, women with PCOS showed more adverse metabolite profiles than the controls. Four lipid fractions in different subclasses of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) were associated with PCOS, after adjusting for WC and correction for multiple testing (P<0.002). In stratified analysis the PCOS women within large WC strata (\u00e2", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Dyslipidemias", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Female", "Finland", "Humans", "Hyperandrogenism", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Metabolomics", "Obesity, Abdominal", "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome", "Testosterone", "Waist Circumference"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028801569", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55675223986": {"Name": "Couto Alves A.", "AuthorID": "55675223986", "AffiliationID": "60175886", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, MRC Health Protection Agency (HPE) Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health"}, "55170819300": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55170819300", "AffiliationID": "60175886", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, MRC Health Protection Agency (HPE) Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health"}, "7003418142": {"Name": "Ala-Korpela M.", "AuthorID": "7003418142", "AffiliationID": "60016622", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Primary Care, Oulu University Hospital"}, "57207896735": {"Name": "J\u00e4rvelin M.R.", "AuthorID": "57207896735", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "NMR Metabolomics Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland"}, "24340185900": {"Name": "Valcarcel B.", "AuthorID": "24340185900", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "10039068700": {"Name": "M\u00e4kinen V.P.", "AuthorID": "10039068700", "AffiliationID": "60016622, 60012954", "AffiliationName": "Computational Medicine, Center for Life-Course Health Research, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital"}, "6603924570": {"Name": "Soininen P.", "AuthorID": "6603924570", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "NMR Metabolomics Laboratory, School of Pharmacy, University of Eastern Finland"}, "55889865800": {"Name": "Coin L.", "AuthorID": "55889865800", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "Computational Medicine, Sch. of Social and Community Medicine and the Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit, University of Bristol"}, "24597745500": {"Name": "Kangas A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597745500", "AffiliationID": "60016622, 60012954", "AffiliationName": "Computational Medicine, Center for Life-Course Health Research, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital"}, "6602491318": {"Name": "Morin-Papunen L.", "AuthorID": "6602491318", "AffiliationID": "60016622, 60012954", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital of Oulu, University of Oulu"}, "57203721635": {"Name": "Sebert S.", "AuthorID": "57203721635", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Biocenter Oulu, University of Oulu"}, "54790582600": {"Name": "De Iorio M.", "AuthorID": "54790582600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7102615765": {"Name": "Franks S.", "AuthorID": "7102615765", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial College London"}}}
