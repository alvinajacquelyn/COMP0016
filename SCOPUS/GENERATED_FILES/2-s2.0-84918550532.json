The performance of bootstrap resampling as applied to PET list-mode data of the human brain and dedicated phantoms is assessed in a novel and systematic way such that: (1) the assessment is carried out in two resampling stages: the 'real world' stage where multiple reference datasets of varying statistical level are generated and the 'bootstrap world' stage where corresponding bootstrap replicates are generated from the reference datasets. (2) All resampled datasets were reconstructed yielding images from which multiple voxel and regions of interest (ROI) values were extracted to form corresponding distributions between the two stages. (3) The difference between the distributions from both stages was quantified using the Jensen-Shannon divergence and the first four moments. It was found that the bootstrap distributions are consistently different to the real world distributions across the statistical levels. The difference was explained by a shift in the mean (up to 33% for voxels and 14% for ROIs) being proportional to the inverse square root of the statistical level (number of counts). Other moments were well replicated by the bootstrap although for very low statistical levels the estimation of the variance was poor. Therefore, the bootstrap method should be used with care when estimating systematic errors (bias) and variance when very low statistical levels are present such as in early time frames of dynamic acquisitions, when the underlying population may not be sufficiently represented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bootstrap", "Image analysis", "Positron emission tomography", "Resampling", "Statistical uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bootstrap", "Bootstrap replicates", "Bootstrap resampling", "Jensen-Shannon divergence", "Multiple references", "Regions of interest", "Resampling", "Statistical uncertainty", "Algorithms", "Brain", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Likelihood Functions", "Models, Theoretical", "Monte Carlo Method", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Spinal Cord"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918550532", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"8699700500": {"Name": "Markiewicz P.J.", "AuthorID": "8699700500", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Sciences, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, University of Manchester"}, "7402837445": {"Name": "Matthews J.C.", "AuthorID": "7402837445", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Sciences, Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre, University of Manchester"}, "7005446767": {"Name": "Reader A.J.", "AuthorID": "7005446767", "AffiliationID": "60030616, 60002494", "AffiliationName": "Brain Imaging Centre, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University"}}}
