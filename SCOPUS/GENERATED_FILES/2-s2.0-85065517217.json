Yet there are only a few empirical tests of how opposition protests influence voter defections in these regimes. To gain empirical traction on this question, I draw on evidence from Russia. Tying together evidence from a protest-event dataset and a panel survey of voters conducted prior to and during the 2011-2012 protest wave, I examine how voters who supported the ruling regime in the past respond to anti-regime mobilization. Results reveal differentiation in defections. While opposition protests dampen support for the ruling regime and depress engagement, they do not necessarily translate into greater support for the regime\u2019s challengers. Findings, which have implications for debates on defection cascades in autocracies, speak to the literatures on authoritarian endurance and the legacies of (attempted) revolutions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electoral autocracies", "protests", "public opinion", "Russia", "voter defections"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065517217", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"57203016112": {"Name": "Tertytchnaya K.", "AuthorID": "57203016112", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
