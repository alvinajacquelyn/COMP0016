They represent the last indirect bounce of illumination before the camera as the composite radiance field emitted by a set of virtual point light sources (VPLs). In complex scenes, current algorithms suffer from a difficult combination of two issues: it remains a challenge to distribute VPLs in a manner that simultaneously gives a high-quality indirect illumination solution for each frame, and to do so in a temporally coherent manner. We address both issues by building, and maintaining over time, an adaptive and temporally coherent distribution of VPLs in locations where they bring indirect light to the image. We introduce a novel heuristic sampling method that strives to only move as few of the VPLs between frames as possible. The result is, to the best of our knowledge, the first interactive global illumination algorithm that works in complex, highly-occluded scenes, suffers little from temporal flickering, supports moving cameras and light sources, and is output-sensitive in the sense that it places VPLs in locations that matter most to the final result.", "AuthorKeywords": ["global illumination", "Instant radiosity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Global illumination", "Heuristic sampling", "Indirect illumination", "Instant radiosity", "Interactive global illumination", "Interactive methods", "Sequential Monte Carlo", "Virtual point light sources"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017406848", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57189037017": {"Name": "Hedman P.", "AuthorID": "57189037017", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36022486900": {"Name": "Karras T.", "AuthorID": "36022486900", "AffiliationID": "60076695", "AffiliationName": "NVIDIA Research"}, "7005279290": {"Name": "Lehtinen J.", "AuthorID": "7005279290", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Aalto University"}}}
