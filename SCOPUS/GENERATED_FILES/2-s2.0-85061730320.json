The paper draws from the experiences of London, Copenhagen, Malmo and Oslo to explore processes of the design, development, use and management of public spaces during this period. The evidence suggests that we have witnessed a period of significant innovation, side by side with major challenges to the collective approach to public spaces. This has led to distinct forms of public spaces that for good or ill have multiplied as a result of the trends discussed in the paper, spaces of; expectation; the private/public sphere; spectacle; respite; infrastructure; diversion; income generation; security; the ephemeral city; community control; occupation; disadvantage; and decline. Episodes of changing practice are set out in the paper and cumulatively reveal distinct and significant changes during the austerity era, although not necessarily in the manner that might have been expected. Instead, in these four cities, the impact of austerity seems to have been eclipsed by other evolving and competing public policy goals, and by the evolving range of public space types.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Austerity", "Innovation", "Public space"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061730320", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"]], "AuthorData": {"7102234035": {"Name": "Carmona M.", "AuthorID": "7102234035", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Planning, UCL"}, "16549629300": {"Name": "Hanssen G.S.", "AuthorID": "16549629300", "AffiliationID": "60068730", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute of Urban and Regional Research, Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences"}, "55894233300": {"Name": "Lamm B.", "AuthorID": "55894233300", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Section for Landscape Architecture and Planning, Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, University of Copenhagen"}, "57221192050": {"Name": "Tietjen A.", "AuthorID": "57221192050", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Section for Landscape Architecture and Planning, Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, University of Copenhagen"}, "8144871200": {"Name": "Nylund K.", "AuthorID": "8144871200", "AffiliationID": "60007905", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urban Studies, Malm\u00f6 University College"}, "6507465101": {"Name": "Saglie I.L.", "AuthorID": "6507465101", "AffiliationID": "60007008", "AffiliationName": "Department of Landscape Architecture and Spatial Planning, Norwegian University of Life Sciences"}}}
