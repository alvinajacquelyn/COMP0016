Most PD cases are considered to be sporadic and despite considerable scientific effort, the underlying cause(s) still remain(s) enigmatic. In particular, it is unknown to which extent epigenetic alterations contribute to the pathophysiology of this devastating disorder. This is partly due to the fact that appropriate PD models are not yet available. Moreover, epigenetic patterns and mechanisms are species specific and murine systems reflect only a few of the idiosyncrasies of human neurons. For several years now, patient-specific stem cell-derived neural and non-neural cells have been employed to overcome this limitation allowing the analysis and establishment of humanized disease models for PD. Thus, several studies tried to dissect epigenetic alterations such as aberrant DNA methylation or microRNA patterns using lund human mesencephalic cell lines or neurons derived from (patient-specific) induced pluripotent stem cells. These studies demonstrate that human neurons have the potential to be used as model systems for the study of epigenetic modifications in PD such as characterizing epigenetic changes, correlating epigenetic changes to gene expression alterations and hopefully using these insights for the development of novel therapeutics. However, more research is required to define the epigenetic (age-associated) landscape of human in vitro neurons and compare these to native neurons before they can be established as suitable models for epigenetic studies in PD. In this review, we summarize the knowledge about epigenetic studies performed on human neuronal PD models, and we discuss advantages and current limitations of these (stem cell-derived) neuronal models for the study of epigenetic alterations in PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epigenetics", "Human", "IPSC", "Neurons", "Parkinson's disease", "Stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068403931", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"39061254700": {"Name": "De Boni L.", "AuthorID": "39061254700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Institute, University College London"}, "57203104223": {"Name": "W\u00fcllner U.", "AuthorID": "57203104223", "AffiliationID": "60030465", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Bonn, German Center for Neurologic Diseases"}}}
