Management of uveitic glaucoma remains challenging. Treatment is targeted at reducing the inflammation and lowering the intraocular pressure. Recent studies have highlighted the role of viruses, such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and more recently Ebola virus, in the pathogenesis of uveitic glaucoma. Antiviral therapy may be beneficial in eyes with detectable viral DNA. The success of glaucoma surgery is decreased in eyes with uveitic glaucoma, and surgical interventions are associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications. Novel glaucoma surgical and laser treatments may improve the predictability of surgery for uveitic glaucoma, but these require further evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Glaucoma", "Ocular infections", "Ocular surgery", "Uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Glaucoma", "Humans", "Uveitis"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027928427", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"24279147300": {"Name": "Sng C.C.A.", "AuthorID": "24279147300", "AffiliationID": "60024285", "AffiliationName": "Singapore Eye Research Institute"}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Genetics, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College"}, "23767097100": {"Name": "Ang M.", "AuthorID": "23767097100", "AffiliationID": "60008970", "AffiliationName": "Singapore National Eye Centre"}}}
