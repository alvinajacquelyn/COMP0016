We review the treatment of political parties in political geography and beyond, finding fault with the purported divide between society and political parties. In contrast, we argue that political parties are necessarily embroiled and enmeshed in and of society, and that assemblage and affect provide potentially vibrant ways to reengage with their importance and meaning. Assemblage theory foregrounds embodied and affective aspects of voters as well as the multiple temporalities that come together to create the election as an event. In order to ground this theoretical argument, we investigate the potentials of an election campaign flyer, as well as suggesting other avenues of study.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928809086", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Computers in Earth Sciences", "EART", "1903"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"56612870800": {"Name": "Page S.", "AuthorID": "56612870800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "10139031000": {"Name": "Dittmer J.", "AuthorID": "10139031000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
