Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Institute of Mathematics and its Applications. All rights reserved.This paper addresses the problems of disparity and optical flow partitioning based on the brightness invariance assumption. We investigate new variational approaches to these problems with Potts priors and possibly box constraints. For the optical flow partitioning, our model includes vector-valued data and an adapted Potts regularizer. Using the notion of asymptotically level stable (als) functions, we prove the existence of global minimizers of our functionals. We propose a modified alternating direction method of multipliers. This iterative algorithm requires the computation of global minimizers of classical univariate Potts problems which can be done efficiently by dynamic programming. We prove that the algorithm converges both for the constrained and unconstrained problems. Numerical examples demonstrate the very good performance of our partitioning method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["0 minimization", "ADMM-like algorithm", "Disparity partitioning", "Jump sparsity", "Optical flow partitioning", "Potts priors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947417520", "SubjectAreas": [["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"], ["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"]], "AuthorData": {"56669096900": {"Name": "Cai X.", "AuthorID": "56669096900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Plant Sciences"}, "56685496900": {"Name": "Fitschen J.H.", "AuthorID": "56685496900", "AffiliationID": "60009941", "AffiliationName": "University of Kaiserslautern, Department of Mathematics"}, "56269713300": {"Name": "Steidl G.", "AuthorID": "56269713300", "AffiliationID": "60009941", "AffiliationName": "University of Kaiserslautern, Department of Mathematics"}, "7102804796": {"Name": "Nikolova M.", "AuthorID": "7102804796", "AffiliationID": "60004981, 60180341, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "CMLA, ENS Cachan, CNRS"}, "35148468300": {"Name": "Storath M.", "AuthorID": "35148468300", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Imaging Group EPFL"}}}
