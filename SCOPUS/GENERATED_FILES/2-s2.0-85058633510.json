Existing theories suggest that scale errors may result from immaturities in children's action planning system, which might be overpowered by increased complexity of object representations or developing teleofunctional bias. We used computational modelling to emulate children's learning to associate objects with actions and to select appropriate actions, given object shape and size. A computational Developmental Deep Model of Action and Naming (DDMAN) was built on the dual-route theory of action selection, in which actions on objects are selected via a direct (nonsemantic or visual) route or an indirect (semantic) route. As in case of children, DDMAN produced scale errors: the number of errors was high at the beginning of training and decreased linearly but did not disappear completely. Inspection of emerging object\u2013action associations revealed that these were coarsely organized by shape, hence leading DDMAN to initially select actions based on shape rather than size. With experience, DDMAN gradually learned to use size in addition to shape when selecting actions. Overall, our simulations demonstrate that children's scale errors are a natural consequence of learning to associate objects with actions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["action selection", "computational model", "perception\u2013action coupling", "scale errors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Association Learning", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Computer Simulation", "Decision Making", "Female", "Humans", "Judgment", "Male", "Semantics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058633510", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"25649411600": {"Name": "Grzyb B.J.", "AuthorID": "25649411600", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Osaka University"}, "8629334500": {"Name": "Cattani A.", "AuthorID": "8629334500", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "University of Plymouth"}, "24376377900": {"Name": "Floccia C.", "AuthorID": "24376377900", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "University of Plymouth"}, "6701387796": {"Name": "Cangelosi A.", "AuthorID": "6701387796", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science, University of Manchester"}, "55843502400": {"Name": "Asada M.", "AuthorID": "55843502400", "AffiliationID": "60024322", "AffiliationName": "Osaka University"}, "7402580650": {"Name": "Nagai Y.", "AuthorID": "7402580650", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"}}}
