As such, the design of interaction mechanisms that enable users to understand the operation of autonomous systems and flexibly delegate or regain control is an open challenge for HCI. Against this background, in this paper we report on a lab study designed to investigate whether displaying the confidence of an autonomous system about the quality of its work, which we call its confidence information, can improve user acceptance and interaction with autonomous systems. The results demonstrate that confidence information encourages the usage of the autonomous system we tested, compared to a situation where such information is not available. Furthermore, an additional contribution of our work is the method we employ to study users' incentives to do work in collaboration with the autonomous system. In experiments comparing different incentive strategies, our results indicate that our translation of behavioural economics research methods to HCI can support the study of interactions with autonomous systems in the lab.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomous agent", "Behavioural economics", "Confidence information", "Lab study"], "IndexKeywords": ["Autonomous systems", "Confidence information", "Incentive strategies", "Interaction mechanisms", "Lab study", "Online sources", "User acceptance"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991090781", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"57191504484": {"Name": "Verame J.", "AuthorID": "57191504484", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "22834126300": {"Name": "Costanza E.", "AuthorID": "22834126300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}, "6603260372": {"Name": "Ramchurn S.", "AuthorID": "6603260372", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "University of Southampton"}}}
