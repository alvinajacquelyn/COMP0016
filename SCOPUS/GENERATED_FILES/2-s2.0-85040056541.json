Dynamics and kinetics of homo-molecular PAH collision under different temperatures, impact parameters, and orientations are studied at an atomic level, which is of great value to understand and model the PAH dimerization. In the collision process, the enhancement factors of homo-molecular dimerizations are quantified and found to be larger at lower temperatures or with smaller PAH instead of size independent. Within the capture radius, the lifetime of the formed PAH dimer decreases as the impact parameter increases. Temperature and PAH characteristic dependent forward and reverse rate constants of homo-molecular PAH dimerization are derived from MD simulations, on the basis of which a reversible model is developed. This model can predict the tendency of PAH dimerization as validated by pyrene dimerization experiments [H. Sabbah et al., J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 1(19), 2962 (2010)]. Results from this study indicate that the physical dimerization cannot be an important source under the typical flame temperatures and PAH concentrations, which implies a more significant role played by the chemical route.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Collision process", "Enhancement factor", "Flame temperatures", "Lower temperatures", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS)", "Reactive force field", "Size independents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040056541", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56701945600": {"Name": "Mao Q.", "AuthorID": "56701945600", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering, Ministry of Education, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55982043400": {"Name": "Ren Y.", "AuthorID": "55982043400", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60001604, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering, Ministry of Education, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "7004035944": {"Name": "Van Duin A.C.T.", "AuthorID": "7004035944", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering, Pennsylvania State University"}}}
