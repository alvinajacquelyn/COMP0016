The reconstruction technique is based on Tikhonov regularization with a Sobolev smoothness penalty and discretizing the forward model using continuous piecewise linear finite elements.We derive an adaptive finite element algorithm with an a posteriori error estimator involving the concerned state and adjoint variables and the recovered conductivity. The convergence of the algorithm is established, in the sense that the sequence of discrete solutions contains a convergent subsequence to a solution of the optimality system for the continuous formulation. Numerical results are presented to verify the convergence and efficiency of the algorithm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["a posteriori error estimator", "adaptive finite element method", "convergence analysis", "Electrical impedance tomography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026999561", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"8268296700": {"Name": "Jin B.", "AuthorID": "8268296700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57192201950": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192201950", "AffiliationID": "60022279", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Scientific Computing Key Laboratory, Shanghai Universities, E-Institute for Computational Science of Shanghai, Shanghai Normal University"}, "8389644300": {"Name": "Zou J.", "AuthorID": "8389644300", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin"}}}
