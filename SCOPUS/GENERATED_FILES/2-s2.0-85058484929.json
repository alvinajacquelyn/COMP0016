Multiple detector prototypes are being tested, each one with slightly different requirements regarding the format of the data to be analysed. This has generated a variety of ad-hoc solutions for data acquisition and online data monitoring. We present a generic C++11 online monitoring framework called DQM4HEP, which is designed for use as a generic online monitor for particle physics experiments, ranging from small tabletop experiments to large multi-detector testbeams, such as those currently ongoing/planned at the DESY II or CERN SPS beamlines. We present results obtained using DQM4HEP at several testbeams where the CALICE AHCAL, SDHCAL and SiWECAL detector prototypes have been tested. During these testbeams, online analysis using DQM4HEP's framework has been developed and used. We also present the currently ongoing work to integrate DQM4HEP within the EUDAQ tool. EUDAQ is a tool for common and generic data acquisition within the AIDA-2020 collaboration. This will allow these two frameworks to work together as a generic and complete DAQ and monitoring system for any type of detector prototype tested on beam tests, which is one of the goals of the AIDA-2020 project.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Monitoring system", "Multi-detectors", "Multiple detectors", "On-line analysis", "On-line monitors", "Online data", "Online monitoring", "Particle physics experiments"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058484929", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"48460959100": {"Name": "Chavez-Barajas C.", "AuthorID": "48460959100", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}, "57203094876": {"Name": "Coates T.", "AuthorID": "57203094876", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}, "35278894500": {"Name": "Salvatore F.", "AuthorID": "35278894500", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}, "35239832600": {"Name": "Cussans D.", "AuthorID": "35239832600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol"}, "56301395600": {"Name": "Ete R.", "AuthorID": "56301395600", "AffiliationID": "60030635", "AffiliationName": "Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron - DESY"}, "55957980700": {"Name": "Irles A.", "AuthorID": "55957980700", "AffiliationID": "60073296, 60106017, 60025995", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de l'Acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur Lin\u00e9aire, Centre Scientifique d'Orsay, Universit\u00e9 de Paris-Sud XI, CNRS/IN2P3"}, "24299427000": {"Name": "Mirabito L.", "AuthorID": "24299427000", "AffiliationID": "60084311, 60025995, 60102126", "AffiliationName": "Universite Lyon et Institut de Physique Nuclaire de Lyon - IPNL, CNRS/IN2P3"}, "57188758738": {"Name": "Pingault A.", "AuthorID": "57188758738", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Ghent Univiersity"}, "35279041700": {"Name": "Wing M.", "AuthorID": "35279041700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
