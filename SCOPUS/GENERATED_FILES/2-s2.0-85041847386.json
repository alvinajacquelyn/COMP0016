Previous results have shown in simulations that it converges using around 40 projections independent of many factors. The aim of this study is to improve the algorithm further by using a better initial image and a modified preconditioner that is less sensitive to noise and data scale. By initializing the algorithm with the best initial image (one full iteration of OSEM with 35 subsets), ROI values can converge almost twice as fast for the same computation time. Moreover, the new preconditioner makes the performance more consistent between high and low count data sets. In addition, we have found a means to choose the stopping criteria to reach a desired level of quantitative accuracy in the reconstructed image. Based on the results with patient data, the optimized LBFGS-B-PC shows promise for clinical imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Computation time", "Limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno", "Map reconstruction", "Maximum a posteriori algorithm", "Preconditioners", "Quantitative accuracy", "Reconstructed image", "Stopping criteria"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041847386", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"35621323500": {"Name": "Tsai Y.J.", "AuthorID": "35621323500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "15842886700": {"Name": "Bousse A.", "AuthorID": "15842886700", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospital"}, "57203050071": {"Name": "Hutton B.F.", "AuthorID": "57203050071", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London Hospital"}, "7006642803": {"Name": "Stearns C.W.", "AuthorID": "7006642803", "AffiliationID": "60106890", "AffiliationName": "MICT Engineering, GE Healthcare"}, "7401988960": {"Name": "Ahn S.", "AuthorID": "7401988960", "AffiliationID": "60021211", "AffiliationName": "Image Reconstruction Lab, GE Global Research"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60011664", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong"}, "23480655200": {"Name": "Thielemans K.", "AuthorID": "23480655200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
