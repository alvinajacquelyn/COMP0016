To facilitate the interpretation of experimental photoabsorption and photoluminescence spectra we provide (i) statistically exact diffusion quantum Monte Carlo binding-energy data for a Mott-Wannier model of (donor/acceptor-bound) excitons, trions, and biexcitons in two-dimensional semiconductors in which charges interact via the Keldysh potential, (ii) contact pair-distribution functions to allow a perturbative description of contact interactions between charge carriers, and (iii) an analysis and classification of the different types of bright trions and biexcitons that can be seen in single-layer molybdenum and tungsten dichalcogenides. We investigate the stability of biexcitons in which two charge carriers are indistinguishable, finding that they are only bound when the indistinguishable particles are several times heavier than the distinguishable ones. Donor/acceptor-bound biexcitons have similar binding energies to the experimentally measured biexciton binding energies. We predict the relative positions of all stable free and bound excitonic complexes of distinguishable charge carriers in the photoluminescence spectra of WSe2 and MoSe2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028973664", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55874911100": {"Name": "Mostaani E.", "AuthorID": "55874911100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Centre, Engineering Department, University of Cambridge"}, "55341206900": {"Name": "Szyniszewski M.", "AuthorID": "55341206900", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "National Graphene Institute, University of Manchester"}, "57214411707": {"Name": "Price C.H.", "AuthorID": "57214411707", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "57195590075": {"Name": "Hunt R.J.", "AuthorID": "57195590075", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "8241383700": {"Name": "Drummond N.D.", "AuthorID": "8241383700", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "14047896100": {"Name": "Danovich M.", "AuthorID": "14047896100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "National Graphene Institute, University of Manchester"}, "7004414785": {"Name": "Fal'Ko V.I.", "AuthorID": "7004414785", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "National Graphene Institute, University of Manchester"}, "6603499335": {"Name": "Maezono R.", "AuthorID": "6603499335", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, School of Information Science"}}}
