{"Title": "TIMEDELN: A programme for the detection and parametrization of overlapping resonances using the time-delay method", "Year": 2017, "Source": "Comput Phys Commun", "Volume": "215", "Issue": null, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 137, "PageEnd": 148, "CitedBy": 7, "DOI": "10.1016/j.cpc.2017.01.005", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85014428431&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2017 Elsevier B.V.TIMEDELN implements the time-delay method of determining resonance parameters from the characteristic Lorentzian form displayed by the largest eigenvalues of the time-delay matrix. TIMEDELN constructs the time-delay matrix from input K-matrices and analyses its eigenvalues. This new version implements multi-resonance fitting and may be run serially or as a high performance parallel code with three levels of parallelism. TIMEDELN takes K-matrices from a scattering calculation, either read from a file or calculated on a dynamically adjusted grid, and calculates the time-delay matrix. This is then diagonalized, with the largest eigenvalue representing the longest time-delay experienced by the scattering particle. A resonance shows up as a characteristic Lorentzian form in the time-delay: the programme searches the time-delay eigenvalues for maxima and traces resonances when they pass through different eigenvalues, separating overlapping resonances. It also performs the fitting of the calculated data to the Lorentzian form and outputs resonance positions and widths. Any remaining overlapping resonances can be fitted jointly. The branching ratios of decay into the open channels can also be found. The programme may be run serially or in parallel with three levels of parallelism. The parallel code modules are abstracted from the main physics code and can be used independently. New version programme summary Programme Title:TIMEDELN Programme Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/wmv4f42xnz.1 Licencing provisions: MIT Programming language: FORTRAN Journal reference of previous version: Computer Phys. Comms., 114, 236\u2013242 (1998). Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Nature of problem:TIMEDELN detects and parametrizes resonances, including overlapping resonances when provided with the K-matrix of the scattering problem. Solution method: Resonances are identified by peaks in the largest few eigenvalues of the time-delay matrix. Reasons for the new version:TIMEDELN includes a new procedure for fitting multiple overlapping resonances. It has also been parallelized to allow studies of complex systems (atoms and molecules) and generation of bulk data. Summary of revisions:TIMEDELN analyses the largest eigenvalues of the time-delay matrix and identifies those with resonance features which are then separated and fitted [6]. It has been modularized with calls to external libraries and user supplied routines abstracted for ease of modification. It has been parallelized, with a choice of a specific module allowing multi-level parallel structures or serial execution if preferred. It can run bulk simulations of \u2018similar but different\u2019 calculations (for example, varying fixed-nuclear geometries). Restrictions: When \u2018target\u2019 energies are calculated or supplied, the energy of the incident particle (electron) is currently defined with respect to the lowest supplied target energy (the ground state), although an expert user or developer would be able to modify this. Unusual features:TIMEDELN can be run from a user-supplied file for K-matrices or can be implemented to generate these as required. External routines/libraries: Lapack [1], Minpack [2], options for alternatives (e.g. NAG [3]), option for MPI [4] Additional comments:TIMEDELN has been implemented as part of the UKRMol suite of codes [7].
