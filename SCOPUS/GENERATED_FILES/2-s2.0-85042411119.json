From 2006 NICE had produced public health guidelines based on the principles of evidence-based medicine. This study explores how the guidelines were received in the new environment in local government and related issues raised relating to the use of evidence in local authoritites. Methods In depth, interviews with 31 elected members and officers, including Directors of Public Health, from four very different local government organizations (\u2018local authorities\u2019). Results Participants reported that (i) there were tensions between evidence-based, and political decision-making; (ii) there were differences in views about what constituted \u2018good\u2019 evidence and (iii) that organizational life is an important mediator in the way evidence is used. Conclusions Democratic political decision-making does not necessarily naturally align with decision-making based on evidence from the international scientific literature, and local knowledge and local evidence are very important in the ways that public health decisions are made.", "AuthorKeywords": ["communities", "Methods", "Organizations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making", "Democracy", "England", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Guidelines as Topic", "Humans", "Interprofessional Relations", "Interviews as Topic", "Local Government", "Politics", "Public Health", "Public Health Administration", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042411119", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57040355200": {"Name": "Kelly M.", "AuthorID": "57040355200", "AffiliationID": "60009587, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Unit, Institute of Public Health, University of Cambridge"}, "7005842007": {"Name": "Atkins L.", "AuthorID": "7005842007", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "55985851100": {"Name": "Littleford C.", "AuthorID": "55985851100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Behaviour Change, University College London"}, "21334820200": {"Name": "Leng G.", "AuthorID": "21334820200", "AffiliationID": "60022176", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Care Excellence"}}}
