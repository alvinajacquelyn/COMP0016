The main part of the block is an infinite wedge cylinder and the front of the body is part of an elliptical cone. Incompressible velocity potential theory is used together with fully nonlinear boundary conditions. When gravity is ignored, it is found that self-similar solution is possible. The boundary element method is used to solve the problem. The free surface shape is updated together with the potential on the free surface until the flow has become self-similar. Convergence studies are taken with respect to marching step and element size. Simulations are made for different bodies and different beach angles. Extensive results are provided for the pressure as well as the free surface shape, and their implications in physics are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D sliding block", "Boundary element method", "Fully nonlinear boundary conditions", "Impact with liquid", "Velocity potential theory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Element sizes", "Free surface shapes", "Free surfaces", "Fully nonlinear", "Self-similar solution", "Sliding blocks", "Three dimensional (3D) problems", "Velocity potentials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985010548", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"57214320174": {"Name": "Sun S.", "AuthorID": "57214320174", "AffiliationID": "60003353", "AffiliationName": "College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering University"}, "14012675900": {"Name": "Wu G.", "AuthorID": "14012675900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "55433992900": {"Name": "Sun S.", "AuthorID": "55433992900", "AffiliationID": "60069706", "AffiliationName": "School of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology"}}}
