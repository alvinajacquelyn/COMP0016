This paper presents the design of a stated preference (SP) experiment that captures the complex decision making process of purchasing MaaS products. It uses a prompted recall smartphone based travel survey tool that is expanded by a SP experiment regarding MaaS plan choices. Respondents are presented with repeated choices between four hypothetical MaaS plans out of which three are fixed plans and one is a menu option. This approach allows for testing people's preferences and willingness to pay for flexibility. The attributes of the plans include transport modes and amounts, mode specific features (e.g. 10-minute taxi guarantee), transferability (meaning how much of left over mode-attributes can be transferred to the next month), special prizes (e.g. a free dinner for two) and the price of the plan.", "AuthorKeywords": ["demand", "MaaS plans/packages", "Mobility as a Service", "Stated preference design"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex decision", "demand", "MaaS plans/packages", "Service plan", "Stated preferences", "Transport modes", "Travel surveys", "Willingness to pay"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030259546", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Transportation", "SOCI", "3313"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57191516867": {"Name": "Matyas M.", "AuthorID": "57191516867", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MaaSLab, UCL Energy Institute, BSEER, University College London"}, "49861504700": {"Name": "Kamargianni M.", "AuthorID": "49861504700", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MaaSLab, UCL Energy Institute, BSEER, University College London"}}}
