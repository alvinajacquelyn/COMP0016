Methods Medical records between March 2007 and June 2015 were searched for cases of spontaneous septic elbow arthritis with a diagnosis based on clinical signs, arthrocentesis, cytological and microbiological analysis of elbow joint synovial fluid, radiography and outcome following treatment. Results Twenty-one cases of septic arthritis were identified. Pre-existing osteoarthritis was present in 14/15 elbows for which diagnostic imaging was available. Although all cases had increased neutrophil count on synovial fluid cytology, culture was only positive in 12/21. Despite initial improvement in lameness scores (pre-treatment 9/10 [range: 1-10] versus post-treatment 3/10 [range: 1-5]), 11/12 had residual long-term lameness. Recurrence of infection was noted in 3/12 elbows for which long-term (>8 weeks) follow-up was available. There was an acute mortality rate of 2/21 associated with severe systemic sepsis. Clinical Significance Septic arthritis, even in the absence of pyrexia, should be considered as a major differential diagnosis in middle aged, large breed dogs, with pre-existing elbow arthritis, that suffer an acute onset lameness, with elbow joint effusion and discomfort. Antibiotic therapy alone was effective for treatment with high initial response rates. Chronic lameness post-treatment was common, and a high rate of recurrence was seen with 3/12 dogs suffering more than one episode.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elbow", "elbow dysplasia", "infections", "osteoarthritis", "Septic arthritis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056338832", "SubjectAreas": [["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"57217560388": {"Name": "Mielke B.", "AuthorID": "57217560388", "AffiliationID": "60170523, 60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences and Services, Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, Royal Veterinary College"}, "26429775100": {"Name": "Meeson R.", "AuthorID": "26429775100", "AffiliationID": "60170523, 60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences and Services, Queen Mother Hospital for Animals, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6505947941": {"Name": "Comerford E.", "AuthorID": "6505947941", "AffiliationID": "113704192", "AffiliationName": "Small Animal Teaching Hospital, Institute of Veterinary Science"}, "7007090746": {"Name": "English K.", "AuthorID": "7007090746", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology and Population Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}}}
