Here, we utilized first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to demonstrate the growth mode transition from prolate to multiunit configurations for Ge<inf>n</inf> (n=10-50) clusters. In agreement with the injected ion drift tube techniques that \"clusters with n < 70 can be thought of as loosely bound assemblies of small strongly bound fragments (such as Ge<inf>7</inf> and Ge<inf>10</inf>),\" we found these stable fragments are connected by Ge<inf>6</inf>, Ge<inf>9</inf>, or Ge<inf>10</inf> unit (from bulk diamond), via strong covalent bonds. Our calculated cations usually fragment to Ge<inf>7</inf> and Ge<inf>10</inf> clusters, in accordance with the experiment results that the spectra Ge<inf>7</inf> and Ge<inf>10</inf> correspond to the mass abundance spectra. By controlling a germanium cluster with vdW interactions parameters in the program or not, we found that the vdW effects strengthen the covalent bond from different units more strikingly than that in a single unit. With more bonds between units than the threadlike structures, the multiunit structures have larger vdW energies, explaining why the isolated nanowires are harder to produce.", "AuthorKeywords": ["covalent bond", "first-principles calculations", "germanium cluster", "PBE-TS+SCS", "Van der Waals interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["First-principles calculation", "Germanium clusters", "Growth-mode transition", "Injected-ion drift tube techniques", "PBE-TS+SCS", "Semiconductor clusters", "Van der Waals interaction", "Van Der Waals interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940451400", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"57218390131": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57218390131", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clean Energy and Quantum Structures, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "55737153600": {"Name": "Li L.", "AuthorID": "55737153600", "AffiliationID": "60073587", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Engineering, Henan University of Science and Technology"}, "35619926500": {"Name": "Chen W.", "AuthorID": "35619926500", "AffiliationID": "60102079", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Electronic Science, Zhengzhou Normal University"}, "56472195100": {"Name": "Sun Q.", "AuthorID": "56472195100", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clean Energy and Quantum Structures, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "7401504128": {"Name": "Jia Y.", "AuthorID": "7401504128", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "Center for Clean Energy and Quantum Structures, School of Physics and Engineering, Zhengzhou University"}, "56328578400": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "56328578400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57198560184": {"Name": "Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57198560184", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
