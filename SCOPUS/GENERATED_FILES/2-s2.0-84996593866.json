NIPD avoids the risks associated with invasive testing, making prenatal diagnosis more accessible to families at high genetic risk. However, the challenge remains in offering defi nitive diagnosis for autosomal recessive diseases, which is complicated by the predominance of the maternal mutant allele in the cell-free DNA sample and thus requires a variety of different approaches. Validation and diagnostic implementation for NIPD of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is further complicated by presence of a pseudogene that requires a different approach. We have used an assay targeting approximately 6700 heterozygous SNPs around the CAH gene (CYP21A2) to construct the high-risk parental haplotypes and tested this approach in fi ve cases, showing that inheritance of the parental alleles can be correctly identifi ed using NIPD. We are evaluating various measures of the fetal fraction to help determine inheritance of parental mutations. We are currently exploring the utility of an NIPD multi-disorder panel for autosomal recessive disease, to make testing more widely applicable to families with a variety of serious genetic conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell free DNA", "Fetal", "Monogenic disorders", "Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenal Hyperplasia, Congenital", "DNA", "Female", "Genes, Dominant", "Genes, Recessive", "Genetic Diseases, Inborn", "Haplotypes", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Medical Laboratory Science", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "State Medicine", "Steroid 21-Hydroxylase", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996593866", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"23027459500": {"Name": "Drury S.", "AuthorID": "23027459500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57208066633": {"Name": "Mason S.", "AuthorID": "57208066633", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57204295860": {"Name": "McKay F.", "AuthorID": "57204295860", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "18433631700": {"Name": "Boustred C.", "AuthorID": "18433631700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "9535391900": {"Name": "Jenkins L.", "AuthorID": "9535391900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "North East Thames Regional Genetics Laboratory, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7006741537": {"Name": "Chitty L.S.", "AuthorID": "7006741537", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57054874900": {"Name": "Lo K.", "AuthorID": "57054874900", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
