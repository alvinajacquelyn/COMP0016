Many patients with intractable epilepsy can benefit from surgical resection of the tissue generating the seizures; however, difficulty in precisely localising seizure foci has limited the number of patients undergoing surgery as well as potentially lowered its effectiveness. Here we demonstrate a novel imaging method for monitoring rapid changes in cerebral tissue impedance occurring during interictal and ictal activity, and show that it can reveal the propagation of pathological activity in the cortex. Cortical impedance was recorded simultaneously to ECoG using a 30-contact electrode mat placed on the exposed cortex of anaesthetised rats, in which interictal spikes (IISs) and seizures were induced by cortical injection of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), picrotoxin or penicillin. We characterised the tissue impedance responses during IISs and seizures, and imaged these responses in the cortex using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). We found a fast, transient drop in impedance occurring as early as 12. ms prior to the IISs, followed by a steep rise in impedance within ~. 120. ms of the IIS. EIT images of these impedance changes showed that they were co-localised and centred at a depth of 1. mm in the cortex, and that they closely followed the activity propagation observed in the surface ECoG signals. The fast, pre-IIS impedance drop most likely reflects synchronised depolarisation in a localised network of neurons, and the post-IIS impedance increase reflects the subsequent shrinkage of extracellular space caused by the intense activity. EIT could also be used to picture a steady rise in tissue impedance during seizure activity, which has been previously described. Thus, our results demonstrate that EIT can detect and localise different physiological changes during interictal and ictal activity and, in conjunction with ECoG, may in future improve the localisation of seizure foci in the clinical setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EIT", "Epilepsy", "Imaging", "Interictal spike", "Seizure", "Tissue impedance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anesthesia", "Animals", "Cerebral Cortex", "Convulsants", "Electric Impedance", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Reproducibility of Results", "Seizures", "Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943753243", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"15073437400": {"Name": "Vongerichten A.", "AuthorID": "15073437400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56180639400": {"Name": "Santos G.", "AuthorID": "56180639400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "26040428500": {"Name": "Aristovich K.", "AuthorID": "26040428500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56673693400": {"Name": "Avery J.", "AuthorID": "56673693400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205935474": {"Name": "Holder D.", "AuthorID": "57205935474", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204026204": {"Name": "McEvoy A.", "AuthorID": "57204026204", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35243898700": {"Name": "Walker M.", "AuthorID": "35243898700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
