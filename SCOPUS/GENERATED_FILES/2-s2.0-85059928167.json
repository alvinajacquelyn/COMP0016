Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is an important anti-inflammatory protein that regulates host immune defense in the lungs. Here, we investigated the role of SP-D in a murine model of CS-induced inflammation. Pulmonary SP-D localization and abundance was compared between smoker and non-smoker individuals. For in vivo studies, wildtype, and SP-D-deficient mice were exposed to CS for either 12 weeks or 3 days. Moreover, the effect of therapeutic administration of recombinant fragment of human SP-D on the acute CS-induced changes was evaluated. Pulmonary SP-D appeared with heterogenous expression in human smokers, while mouse lung SP-D was uniformly upregulated after CS exposure. We found that SP-D-deficient mice were more susceptible to CS-induced macrophage-rich airway inflammation. SP-D deficiency influenced local pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, with increased CCL3 and interleukin-6 but decreased CXCL1. Furthermore, CS exposure caused significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory ceramides and related ceramide synthase gene transcripts in SP-D-deficient mice compared to wildtype littermates. Administration of recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) alleviated CS-induced macrophage infiltration and prevented induction of ceramide synthase gene expression. Finally, rfhSP-D treatment attenuated CS-induced human epithelial cell apoptosis in vitro. Our results indicate that SP-D deficiency aggravates CS-induced lung inflammation partly through regulation of ceramide synthesis and that local SP-D enrichment rescues CS-induced inflammation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ceramide", "ceramide synthase", "cigarette smoke (CS)", "mouse models", "surfactant protein D (SP-D)"], "IndexKeywords": ["A549 Cells", "Aged", "Animals", "Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid", "Ceramides", "Female", "Humans", "Lung", "Macrophages", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Middle Aged", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "Pulmonary Surfactant-Associated Protein D", "Smoke", "Smoking", "Tobacco", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059928167", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56678464300": {"Name": "Pilecki B.", "AuthorID": "56678464300", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "31967875500": {"Name": "Wulf-Johansson H.", "AuthorID": "31967875500", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "57194752165": {"Name": "St\u00f8ttrup C.", "AuthorID": "57194752165", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "56678309800": {"Name": "J\u00f8rgensen P.T.", "AuthorID": "56678309800", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "57203539887": {"Name": "Nex\u00f8e A.B.", "AuthorID": "57203539887", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "7005888983": {"Name": "Schlosser A.", "AuthorID": "7005888983", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "35467960200": {"Name": "Hansen S.W.K.", "AuthorID": "35467960200", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "57202565360": {"Name": "Holmskov U.", "AuthorID": "57202565360", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "7102982904": {"Name": "Sorensen G.L.", "AuthorID": "7102982904", "AffiliationID": "60019160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer and Inflammation Research, Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of Southern Denmark"}, "15058828500": {"Name": "Djiadeu P.", "AuthorID": "15058828500", "AffiliationID": "60085584", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine, Lung Innate Immunity Research Laboratory, Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, ON"}, "6701610030": {"Name": "Palaniyar N.", "AuthorID": "6701610030", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, Institute of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, ON"}, "35449178600": {"Name": "Madsen J.", "AuthorID": "35449178600", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60175924, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Southampton Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Centre for Biomedical Research, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202405777": {"Name": "Clark H.W.", "AuthorID": "7202405777", "AffiliationID": "60000703, 60175924, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Southampton Respiratory Biomedical Research Unit, Centre for Biomedical Research, University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201429412": {"Name": "Nielsen C.H.", "AuthorID": "7201429412", "AffiliationID": "60006564", "AffiliationName": "Center for Rheumatology and Spine Diseases, Institute for Inflammation Research, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet"}, "34573970200": {"Name": "Vestbo J.", "AuthorID": "34573970200", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801, 60172345", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection, Immunity and Respiratory Medicine, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
