The family consists of p53, p63 and p73 proteins, which share similar structure and function. Activation of wild-type p53 or TAp73 in tumors leads to tumor regression, and small molecules restoring the p53 pathway are in clinical development. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a metabolite of aminolevulinic acid, is a clinically approved drug applied in photodynamic diagnosis and therapy. PpIX induces p53-dependent and TAp73-dependent apoptosis and inhibits TAp73/MDM2 and TAp73/MDM4 interactions. Here we demonstrate that PpIX is a dual inhibitor of p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 interactions and activates apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells without illumination and without affecting normal cells. PpIX stabilizes p53 and TAp73 proteins, induces p53-downstream apoptotic targets and provokes cancer cell death at doses non-toxic to normal cells. Our findings open up new opportunities for repurposing PpIX for treating lymphoblastic leukemia with wild-type TP53.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071145194", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57210597293": {"Name": "Jiang L.", "AuthorID": "57210597293", "AffiliationID": "60082819, 60031584", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology Center, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine"}, "57204277382": {"Name": "Malik N.", "AuthorID": "57204277382", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet"}, "24479628600": {"Name": "Acedo P.", "AuthorID": "24479628600", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet"}, "15123587500": {"Name": "Zawacka-Pankau J.", "AuthorID": "15123587500", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
