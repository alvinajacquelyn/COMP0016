CO2 hydrogenation on the Cu2O (111) surface was investigated systematically, and the respective microscopic reaction mechanisms were elucidated. We show that, whereas CO2 dissociation is not energetically allowed on the Cu2O (111) surface, CO2 hydrogenation to a formate intermediate is more favourable than the formation of a carboxyl intermediate. Further hydrogenation from formate to formic acid is energetically allowed, where formate combines with strongly adsorbed surface hydrogen to form bidentate formic acid moieties. Formation of both the formate and the formic acid from adsorbed CO2 and surface hydrogen are exothermic reactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CO2 hydrogenation", "Copper oxide", "DFT-D", "Formate", "Formic acid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acid moiety", "Catalyzed conversion", "CO2 activation", "CO2 hydrogenation", "Dispersive forces", "Formate", "Reaction mechanism", "Surface hydrogen"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959906229", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"]], "AuthorData": {"55578808242": {"Name": "Mishra A.", "AuthorID": "55578808242", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "De Leeuw N.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}}}
