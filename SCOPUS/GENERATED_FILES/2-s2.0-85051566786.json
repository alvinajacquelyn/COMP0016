Such systems are increasingly deployed by Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) such as Foursquare and Yelp to enhance their usefulness to users. Recently, various RNN architectures have been proposed to incorporate contextual information associated with the users' sequence of checkins (e.g. time of the day, location of venues) to effectively capture the users' dynamic preferences. However, these architectures assume that different types of contexts have an identical impact on the users' preferences, which may not hold in practice. For example, an ordinary context such as the time of the day reflects the user's current contextual preferences, whereas a transition context - such as a time interval from their last visited venue - indicates a transition effect from past behaviour to future behaviour. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Contextual Attention Recurrent Architecture (CARA) that leverages both sequences of feedback and contextual information associated with the sequences to capture the users' dynamic preferences. Our proposed recurrent architecture consists of two types of gating mechanisms, namely 1) a contextual attention gate that controls the influence of the ordinary context on the users' contextual preferences and 2) a time- and geo-based gate that controls the influence of the hidden state from the previous checkin based on the transition context. Thorough experiments on three large checkin and rating datasets from commercial LBSNs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CARA architecture by significantly outperforming many state-of-the-art RNN architectures and factorisation approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Context-aware venue recommendation", "Recurrent neural networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Check-in", "Context-Aware", "Contextual information", "Gating mechanisms", "Hidden state", "Location-based social networks", "State of the art", "Time interval"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051566786", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"56731060600": {"Name": "Manotumruksa J.", "AuthorID": "56731060600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow"}, "8727665600": {"Name": "Macdonald C.", "AuthorID": "8727665600", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow"}, "8061165800": {"Name": "Ounis I.", "AuthorID": "8061165800", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "University of Glasgow"}}}
