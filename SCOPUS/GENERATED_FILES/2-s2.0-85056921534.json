Although there are already some high-end commercial products based on OLEDs, costs must decrease whilst maintaining high operational efficiencies for the technology to realise wider impact. Here we demonstrate efficient action of radical-based OLEDs16, whose emission originates from a spin doublet, rather than a singlet or triplet exciton. While the emission process is still spin-allowed in these OLEDs, the efficiency limitations imposed by triplet excitons are circumvented for doublets. Using a luminescent radical emitter, we demonstrate an OLED with maximum external quantum efficiency of 27 per cent at a wavelength of 710 nanometres\u2014the highest reported value for deep-red and infrared LEDs. For a standard closed-shell organic semiconductor, holes and electrons occupy the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs and LUMOs), respectively, and recombine to form singlet or triplet excitons. Radical emitters have a singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) in the ground state, giving an overall spin-1/2 doublet. If\u2014as expected on energetic grounds\u2014both electrons and holes occupy this SOMO level, recombination returns the system to the ground state, giving no light emission. However, in our very efficient OLEDs, we achieve selective hole injection into the HOMO and electron injection to the SOMO to form the fluorescent doublet excited state with near-unity internal quantum efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056921534", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57192708462": {"Name": "Ai X.", "AuthorID": "57192708462", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University"}, "56872237700": {"Name": "Dong S.", "AuthorID": "56872237700", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University"}, "56872121900": {"Name": "Guo H.", "AuthorID": "56872121900", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University"}, "57196268860": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57196268860", "AffiliationID": "60007711", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Supramolecular Structure and Materials, College of Chemistry, Jilin University"}, "56427161200": {"Name": "Li F.", "AuthorID": "56427161200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57203098115": {"Name": "Evans E.W.", "AuthorID": "57203098115", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "57200150084": {"Name": "Gillett A.J.", "AuthorID": "57200150084", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "55619838400": {"Name": "Hele T.J.H.", "AuthorID": "55619838400", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}, "8077782000": {"Name": "Friend R.H.", "AuthorID": "8077782000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge"}}}
