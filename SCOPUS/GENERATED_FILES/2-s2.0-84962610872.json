However, advanced RTMs can take a long computational time, which makes them unfeasible in many real applications. To overcome this problem, it has been proposed to substitute RTMs through so-called emulators. Emulators are statistical models that approximate the functioning of RTMs. They are advantageous in real practice because of the computational efficiency and excellent accuracy and flexibility for extrapolation. We here present an 'Emulator toolbox' that enables analyzing three multi-output machine learning regression algorithms (MO-MLRAs) on their ability to approximate an RTM. As a proof of concept, a case study on emulating sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) is presented. The toolbox is foreseen to open new opportunities in the use of advanced RTMs, in which both consistent physical assumptions and data-driven machine learning algorithms live together.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ARTMO", "Emulator", "FLEX", "Fluorescence", "multi-output regression algorithms"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962610872", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57208121325": {"Name": "Verrelst J.", "AuthorID": "57208121325", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Image Processing Lab (IPL), University of Valencia"}, "54684821900": {"Name": "Rivera J.", "AuthorID": "54684821900", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Image Processing Lab (IPL), University of Valencia"}, "6603888005": {"Name": "Camps-Valls G.", "AuthorID": "6603888005", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Image Processing Lab (IPL), University of Valencia"}, "7401925341": {"Name": "Moreno J.", "AuthorID": "7401925341", "AffiliationID": "60002644", "AffiliationName": "Image Processing Lab (IPL), University of Valencia"}, "6506374439": {"Name": "Gomez-Dans J.", "AuthorID": "6506374439", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
