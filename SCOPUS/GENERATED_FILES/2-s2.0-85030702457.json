Published by Taylor & Francis.Background: Understanding how people transition between phases of not making a quit attempt to stopping smoking successfully is important in order to optimize interventions. This study aimed to explore differences in attitudes towards smoking and quitting among smokers and ex-smokers. Methods: Adult (age 18 and over) successful (n = 8), unsuccessful (n = 8) and never quitters (n = 7) were recruited through stop-smoking services in England. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and data were analysed using framework analysis. Results: Seven themes (starting to smoke, positive appraisal of smoking, responsibility for past/current smoking, negative effects of smoking, reasons to quit, process of quitting, and identity) were identified in all groups. Sub-group differences were explored and used to derive six typologies with descriptive characteristics: committed smokers, aware smokers, forced attempters, struggling attempters, pragmatic ex-smokers, and committed non-smokers. Using these typologies and the smallest number of differentiating factors between them (awareness of negative effects, motivation to stop and acceptance of responsibility), a parsimonious model of progression towards smoking cessation was developed. Conclusions: Awareness of negative effects, motivation and, crucially, a sense of commitment for taking responsibility to take actions towards behavior change may be important for whether smokers attempt to quit and progress to a successful quit attempt.", "AuthorKeywords": ["process of smoking cessation", "qualitative", "Typology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030702457", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"]], "AuthorData": {"35575144500": {"Name": "Tombor I.", "AuthorID": "35575144500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "15123109500": {"Name": "Shahab L.", "AuthorID": "15123109500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "25724758100": {"Name": "Vangeli E.", "AuthorID": "25724758100", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, London South Bank University"}}}
