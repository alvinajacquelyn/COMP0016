The principal symbol of our operator is assumed to be trace-free. We study the spectral function which is the sum of squares of Euclidean norms of eigenfunctions evaluated at a given point of the manifold, with summation carried out over all eigenvalues between zero and a positive \u03bb. We derive an explicit two-term asymptotic formula for the spectral function as \u03bb \u2192+\u221e, expressing the second asymptotic coefficient via the trace of the subprincipal symbol and the geometric objects encoded within the principal symbol-metric, torsion of the teleparallel connection and topological charge. We then address the question: is our operator a massless Dirac operator on half-densities? We prove that it is a massless Dirac operator on half-densities if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied at every point of the manifold: (a) the subprincipal symbol is proportional to the identity matrix; and (b) the second asymptotic coefficient of the spectral function is zero. \u00a9 2013 \u00a9 2013 London Mathematical Society.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84894240380", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"55884829700": {"Name": "Chervova O.", "AuthorID": "55884829700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "54413977000": {"Name": "Downes R.", "AuthorID": "54413977000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "6603201024": {"Name": "Vassiliev D.", "AuthorID": "6603201024", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
