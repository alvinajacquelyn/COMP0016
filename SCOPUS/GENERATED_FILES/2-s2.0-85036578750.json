This \u2018no-reflow\u2019 phenomenon worsens patient prognosis. In the brain, after stroke, a similar post-ischaemic \u2018no-reflow\u2019 has been attributed to capillary constriction by contractile pericytes. We now show that occlusion of a rat coronary artery, followed by reperfusion, blocks 40% of cardiac capillaries and halves perfused blood volume within the affected region. Capillary blockages colocalised strongly with pericytes, where capillary diameter was reduced by 37%. The pericyte relaxant adenosine increased capillary diameter by 21% at pericyte somata, decreased capillary block by 25% and increased perfusion volume by 57%. Thus, cardiac pericytes constrict coronary capillaries and reduce microvascular blood flow after ischaemia, despite re-opening of the culprit artery. Cardiac pericytes are therefore a novel therapeutic target in ischaemic heart disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Capillaries", "Coronary Vessels", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Perfusion", "Pericytes", "Rats"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036578750", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"57198451074": {"Name": "O\u2019Farrel F.", "AuthorID": "57198451074", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "22956192000": {"Name": "Mastitskaya S.", "AuthorID": "22956192000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57188575219": {"Name": "Hammond-Haley M.", "AuthorID": "57188575219", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "55625841200": {"Name": "Freitas F.", "AuthorID": "55625841200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57198427614": {"Name": "Wah W.", "AuthorID": "57198427614", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006296522": {"Name": "Attwell D.", "AuthorID": "7006296522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
