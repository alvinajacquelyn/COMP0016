Less is known, however, about what drives withdrawal from and re-engagement with social activities in later life. This is an important area of research which has direct implications for public policies that aim to ensure equitable outcomes among older adults. Much of the existing literature supports continuity theory which assumes people will not alter their level of social engagement as they age or after life-changing events. This paper uses data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing over an eight-year period (2002-2010) to determine the effect of short-term changes in marital, employment and health status over an initial four-year period on the dynamics of social detachment over the following four years. We control for underlying socio-economic disadvantages built up during the lifecourse and find that these effects, including poor education, wealth and health, are the most important determinants of persistent detachment from social activities as well as movement into and out of social detachment. The effects are consistent in men and women. The effects of short-term changes in marital and employment status have little effect on social detachment. Recent deterioration in health, however, predicted movement into social detachment, which implies the relationship between health and social detachment is reciprocal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["continuity theory", "cumulative advantage", "English Longitudinal Study of Ageing", "social activity", "social detachment", "socio-economic inequalities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924136030", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"36554360000": {"Name": "Jivraj S.", "AuthorID": "36554360000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003779414": {"Name": "Nazroo J.", "AuthorID": "7003779414", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Sociology and Cathie Marsh Institute for Social Research, University of Manchester"}, "56537696100": {"Name": "Barnes M.", "AuthorID": "56537696100", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, City University London"}}}
