To investigate their impacts on Ly\u03b1 transfer, we apply a novel combination of analytic modelling and cosmological hydrodynamical, radiative transfer simulations to three reionization models: (i) the 'bubble' model, where only diffuse HI outside ionized bubbles is present; (ii) the 'web' model, where HI exists only in overdense self-shielded gas; and (iii) the hybrid 'web-bubble' model. The three models can explain the observed Ly\u03b1 luminosity function equally well, but with very different HI fractions. This confirms a degeneracy between the ionization topology of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and theHI fraction inferred from Ly\u03b1 surveys.We highlight the importance of the clustering of small-scale absorbers around galaxies.Acombined analysis of the Ly\u03b1 luminosity function and the Ly\u03b1 fraction can break this degeneracy and provide constraints on the reionization history and its topology. Constraints can be improved by analysing the full MUV-dependent redshift evolution of the Ly\u03b1 fraction of Lyman break galaxies. We find that the IGM-transmission probability distribution function is unimodal for bubble models and bimodal in web models. Comparing our models to observations, we infer that the neutral fraction at z ~ 7 is likely to be of the order of tens of per cent when interpreted with bubble or web-bubble models, with a conservative lower limit ~1 per cent when interpreted with web models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: theory", "Dark ages", "First stars", "Galaxies: high-redshift", "Intergalactic medium", "Line: formation", "Radiative transfer", "Reionization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014574311", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55413049700": {"Name": "Kakiichi K.", "AuthorID": "55413049700", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "57203088176": {"Name": "Dijkstra M.", "AuthorID": "57203088176", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics, University of Oslo"}, "6603692623": {"Name": "Ciardi B.", "AuthorID": "6603692623", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "36160330800": {"Name": "Graziani L.", "AuthorID": "36160330800", "AffiliationID": "60024986", "AffiliationName": "INAF Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma"}}}
