Methods: CONFIRM was a 2-year, placebo-controlled study of the efficacy and safety of DMF 240 mg twice (BID) or 3 times daily (TID) in 1,417 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS); subcutaneous glatiramer acetate 20 mg once daily was included as an active reference comparator. The number and volume of T2-hyperintense, T1-hypointense, and gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions, as well as whole brain volume and MTR, were assessed in 681 patients (MRI cohort). Results: DMF BID and TID produced significant and consistent reductions vs placebo in the number of new or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions and new nonenhancing T1-hypointense lesions after 1 and 2 years of treatment and in the number of Gd+ lesions at week 24, year 1, and year 2. Lesion volumes were also significantly reduced. Reductions in brain atrophy and MTR changes with DMF relative to placebo did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: The robust effects on MRI active lesion counts and total lesion volume in patients with RRMS demonstrate the ability of DMF to exert beneficial effects on inflammatory lesion activity in multiple sclerosis, and support DMF therapy as a valuable new treatment option in RRMS. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class I evidence of reduction in brain lesion number and volume, as assessed by MRI, over 2 years of delayed-release DMF treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Dimethyl Fumarate", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Fumarates", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Internationality", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925340335", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36077375900": {"Name": "Miller D.H.", "AuthorID": "36077375900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "6602501665": {"Name": "Wheeler-Kingshott C.A.M.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7003766786": {"Name": "Tozer D.J.", "AuthorID": "7003766786", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7004983307": {"Name": "MacManus D.G.", "AuthorID": "7004983307", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7403466709": {"Name": "Fox R.J.", "AuthorID": "7403466709", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Cleveland Clinic"}, "57193627937": {"Name": "Phillips J.T.", "AuthorID": "57193627937", "AffiliationID": "60026935", "AffiliationName": "Multiple Sclerosis Program, Baylor Institute for Immunology Research"}, "56468810100": {"Name": "Hutchinson M.", "AuthorID": "56468810100", "AffiliationID": "60008643", "AffiliationName": "St. Vincent's University Hospital, Elm Park"}, "57201596736": {"Name": "Havrdova E.", "AuthorID": "57201596736", "AffiliationID": "60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University"}, "7102546892": {"Name": "Kita M.", "AuthorID": "7102546892", "AffiliationID": "60030223", "AffiliationName": "Virginia Mason Medical Center"}, "56565260600": {"Name": "Goodsell M.", "AuthorID": "56565260600", "AffiliationID": "114186426", "AffiliationName": "CircleScience"}, "56171891400": {"Name": "Yang M.", "AuthorID": "56171891400", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen Idec Incorporated"}, "55808115600": {"Name": "Zhang R.", "AuthorID": "55808115600", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen Idec Incorporated"}, "6507808220": {"Name": "Viglietta V.", "AuthorID": "6507808220", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen Idec Incorporated"}, "7201689788": {"Name": "Dawson K.T.", "AuthorID": "7201689788", "AffiliationID": "60029337", "AffiliationName": "Biogen Idec Incorporated"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
