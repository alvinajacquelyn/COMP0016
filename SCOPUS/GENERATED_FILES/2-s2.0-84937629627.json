Little is known about the characteristics of long-term users, their smoking behaviour, attachment to smoking, experience of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, or their views on these devices. This study aimed to provide preliminary evidence on this and compare users of the different products. Methods: UK participants were recruited from four naturally occurring groups of long-term (\u22656 months) users of either EC or NRT who had stopped or continued to smoke (N= 36 per group, total N= 144). Participants completed a questionnaire assessing socio-demographic and smoking characteristics, nicotine withdrawal symptoms, smoker identity and attitudes towards the products they were using. Results: Adjusting for relevant confounders, EC use was associated with a stronger smoker identity (Wald X2(1)=3.9, p=0.048) and greater product endorsement (Wald X2(1)=4.6, p=0.024) than NRT use, irrespective of smoking status. Among ex-smokers, EC users reported less severe mood and physical symptoms (Wald X2(1)=6.1, p=0.014) and cravings (Wald X2(1)=8.5, p=0.003), higher perceived helpfulness of the product (Wald X2(1)=4.8, p=0.028) and lower intentions to stop using the product (Wald X2(1)=17.6, p<0.001) than NRT users. Conclusions: Compared with people who use NRT for at least 6 months, those who use EC over that time period appear to have a stronger smoker identity and like their products more. Among long-term users who have stopped smoking, ECs are perceived as more helpful than NRT, appear more effective in controlling withdrawal symptoms and continued use may be more likely.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electronic cigarettes", "Harm reduction", "Identity", "Nicotine withdrawal", "NRT use", "Smoking cessation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Electronic Cigarettes", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nicotine", "Patient Satisfaction", "Self-Assessment", "Smoking Cessation", "Substance Withdrawal Syndrome", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Tobacco Use Disorder", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937629627", "SubjectAreas": [["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56656146200": {"Name": "Nelson V.", "AuthorID": "56656146200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56479173000": {"Name": "Sheals K.", "AuthorID": "56479173000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "15123109500": {"Name": "Shahab L.", "AuthorID": "15123109500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56926916000": {"Name": "Goniewicz M.", "AuthorID": "56926916000", "AffiliationID": "60022577", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Behavior, Roswell Park Cancer Institute"}, "35224537600": {"Name": "Beard E.", "AuthorID": "35224537600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55547124591": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124591", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
