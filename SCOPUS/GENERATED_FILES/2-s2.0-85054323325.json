{"Title": "Impact of Zostavax Vaccination on T-Cell Accumulation and Cutaneous Gene Expression in the Skin of Older Humans After Varicella Zoster Virus Antigen-Specific Challenge", "Year": 2018, "Source": "J.

However, the impact of vaccination on the cutaneous response to VZV is not known. Methods: We investigated the response to intradermal VZV antigen challenge before and after Zostavax vaccination in participants >70 years of age by immunohistological and transcriptomic analyses of skin biopsy specimens collected from the challenge site. Results: Vaccination increased the proportion of VZV-specific CD4+ T cells in the blood and promoted the accumulation of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the skin after VZV antigen challenge. However, Zostavax did not alter the proportion of resident memory T cells (CD4+ and CD8+) or CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in unchallenged skin. After vaccination, there was increased cutaneous T-cell proliferation at the challenge site and also increased recruitment of T cells from the blood, as indicated by an elevated T-cell migratory gene signature. CD8+ T-cell-associated functional genes were also highly induced in the skin after vaccination. Conclusion: Zostavax vaccination does not alter the abundance of cutaneous resident memory T cells but instead increases the recruitment of VZV-specific T cells from the blood and enhances T-cell activation, particularly cells of the CD8+ subset, in the skin after VZV antigen challenge.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antigens, Viral", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Herpes Zoster", "Herpes Zoster Vaccine", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "Humans", "Lymphocyte Activation", "Male", "T-Lymphocyte Subsets", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Vaccination", "Vaccines, Attenuated", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054323325", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57198804168": {"Name": "Patel N.P.", "AuthorID": "57198804168", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology"}, "6507455433": {"Name": "Vukmanovic-Stejic M.", "AuthorID": "6507455433", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "36625044000": {"Name": "Chambers E.S.", "AuthorID": "36625044000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "55565965500": {"Name": "Sandhu D.", "AuthorID": "55565965500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology"}, "7006856048": {"Name": "Akbar A.N.", "AuthorID": "7006856048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006463634": {"Name": "Rustin M.H.A.", "AuthorID": "7006463634", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology"}, "10140242800": {"Name": "Suarez-Farinas M.", "AuthorID": "10140242800", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, Rockefeller University"}, "14017956800": {"Name": "Fuentes-Duculan J.", "AuthorID": "14017956800", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, Rockefeller University"}, "7201666842": {"Name": "Krueger J.", "AuthorID": "7201666842", "AffiliationID": "60026827", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology, Rockefeller University"}, "7003655701": {"Name": "Mabbott N.A.", "AuthorID": "7003655701", "AffiliationID": "60021301, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh"}}}
