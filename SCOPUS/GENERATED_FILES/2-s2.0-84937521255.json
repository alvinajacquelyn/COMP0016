All rights reserved.Objectives To present a Greek family in which 5 male and 2 female members developed progressive spastic paraplegia. Plasma very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) were reportedly normal at first testing in an affected male and for over 30 years the presumed diagnosis was hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) was used as a further diagnostic tool. Methods Targeted exome sequencing in the proband, followed by Sanger sequencing confirmation; mutation segregation testing in multiple family members and plasma VLCFA measurement in the proband. Results NGS of the proband revealed a novel frameshift mutation in ABCD1 (c.1174-1178del, p.Leu392Serfs\u22177), bringing an end to diagnostic uncertainty by establishing the diagnosis of adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the myelopathic phenotype of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The mutation segregated in all family members and the diagnosis of AMN/ALD was confirmed by plasma VLCFA measurement. Confounding factors that delayed the diagnosis are presented. Conclusions This report highlights the diagnostic utility of NGS in patients with undiagnosed spastic paraplegia, establishing a molecular diagnosis of AMN, allowing proper genetic counseling and management, and overcoming the diagnostic delay that can be rarely caused by false negative VLCFA analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ABCD1", "Adrenomyeloneuropathy", "Hereditary spastic paraplegia", "Next generation sequencing", "Novel mutation", "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters", "Family Health", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Spastic Paraplegia, Hereditary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937521255", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"8582714300": {"Name": "Koutsis G.", "AuthorID": "8582714300", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60007844", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, 1st Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital"}, "6603564802": {"Name": "Karadima G.", "AuthorID": "6603564802", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60007844", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, 1st Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital"}, "7003408189": {"Name": "Panas M.", "AuthorID": "7003408189", "AffiliationID": "60067083, 60007844", "AffiliationName": "Neurogenetics Unit, 1st Department of Neurology, University of Athens Medical School, Eginition Hospital"}, "56666751600": {"Name": "Lynch D.S.", "AuthorID": "56666751600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36189161300": {"Name": "Tucci A.", "AuthorID": "36189161300", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi di Milano"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
