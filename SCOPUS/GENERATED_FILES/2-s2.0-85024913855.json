Herein, a cost-effective and reproducible aqueous solution-based polymer-assisted deposition approach is developed to grow p-type Cu2Zn(Sn, Ge)(S, Se)4 thin films with tunable bandgap. The bandgap of Cu2Zn(Sn, Ge)(S, Se)4 thin films can be tuned within the range 1.05\u22121.95 eV using the aqueous polymer-assisted deposition by accurately controlling the elemental compositions. One of the as-grown Cu2Zn(Sn, Ge)(S, Se)4 thin films exhibits a hall coefficient of +137 cm3/C. The resistivity, concentration and carrier mobility of the Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 thin film are 3.17 ohm\u00b7cm, 4.5 \u00d7 1016 cm\u22123, and 43 cm2/(V\u00b7S) at room temperature, respectively. Moreover, the Cu2ZnSn(S, Se)4 thin film when used as an active layer in a solar cell leads to a power conversion efficiency of 3.55%. The facile growth of Cu2Zn(Sn, Ge)(S, Se)4 thin films in an aqueous system, instead of organic solvents, provides great promise as an environmental-friendly platform to fabricate a variety of single/multi metal chalcogenides for the thin film industry and solution-processed photovoltaic devices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bandgap tunable", "CZTGeSSe", "Polymer-assisted deposition", "Solar cells", "Solution processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["CZTGeSSe", "Elemental compositions", "Inorganic photovoltaics", "Polymer-assisted deposition", "Power conversion efficiencies", "Semiconductor thin films", "Solution-processing", "Stoichiometric compositions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024913855", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55967685900": {"Name": "Yi Q.", "AuthorID": "55967685900", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University"}, "57187208600": {"Name": "Zhao J.", "AuthorID": "57187208600", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University"}, "57216290311": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57216290311", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University"}, "57197844544": {"Name": "Hu J.", "AuthorID": "57197844544", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University"}, "55968237800": {"Name": "Dai X.", "AuthorID": "55968237800", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University"}, "7102849239": {"Name": "Zou G.", "AuthorID": "7102849239", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "College of Physics, Optoelectronics and Energy and Collaborative Innovation Center of Suzhou Nano Science and Technology, Soochow University"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
