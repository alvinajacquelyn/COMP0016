In this paper we present a molecular dynamics study of eight different oligomeric compounds that have been proposed as potential kinetic inhibitors for methane hydrate. The results show that statistically significant variations in hydrate formation, induced by the chemical additive, can be observed within a relatively modest series of molecular dynamics simulations, thus opening the way for computational screening for optimal additives to control hydrate formation. One amino acid oligomer, asparagine, was found to be more active than a number of synthetic inhibitors, including PVCap.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clathrates", "Gas hydrates", "Kinetic inhibitors", "Methane hydrate", "Molecular dynamics", "Nucleation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical additive", "Clathrates", "Kinetic inhibitor", "Methane hydrates", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Nucleation and growth", "Research interests", "Synthetic inhibitors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945207614", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56922169400": {"Name": "Oluwunmi P.", "AuthorID": "56922169400", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Scientific Computing, University of Warwick"}, "54082998100": {"Name": "Finney A.", "AuthorID": "54082998100", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Scientific Computing, University of Warwick"}, "57214922832": {"Name": "Rodger P.", "AuthorID": "57214922832", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Scientific Computing, University of Warwick"}}}
