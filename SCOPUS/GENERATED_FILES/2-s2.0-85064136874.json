Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.The concept of coproduction primarily refers to direct user involvement in the production of services. This paper identifies the main dimensions of this broad and at times fuzzy concept and focuses on types and styles of leadership that can emerge from, and sustain, effective coproduction practice. We do so by carrying out a narrative review of cases of coproduction in the UK, with a focus on the role of citizens, bureaucrats and, specifically, local politicians, to unpick how the latter can facilitate or hinder coproductive processes. The analysis distances itself from a traditional understanding of leadership to examine relational dynamics rather than organisation structures as the key variable of leadership within coproductive practices.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaborative governance", "Coproduction", "Facilitative leadership", "Local government", "Participatory planning"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064136874", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"55814219100": {"Name": "Bussu S.", "AuthorID": "55814219100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56267075700": {"Name": "Galanti M.", "AuthorID": "56267075700", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "University of Milan"}}}
