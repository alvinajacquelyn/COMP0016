Smart manufacturing is a key component of the broader thrust towards Industry 4.0, and relies on the creation of a bridge between digital and physical environments through Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, coupled with enhancements to those digital environments through greater use of cloud systems, data analytics and machine learning. Whilst these individual technologies have been in development for some time, their integration with industrial systems leads to new challenges as well as potential benefits. In this paper, we explore the challenges faced by those wishing to secure smart manufacturing systems. Lessons from history suggest that where an attempt has been made to retrofit security on systems for which the primary driver was the development of functionality, there are inevitable and costly breaches. Indeed, today's manufacturing systems have started to experience this over the past few years; however, the integration of complex smart manufacturing technologies massively increases the scope for attack from adversaries aiming at industrial espionage and sabotage. The potential outcome of these attacks ranges from economic damage and lost production, through injury and loss of life, to catastrophic nation-wide effects. In this paper, we discuss the security of existing industrial and manufacturing systems, existing vulnerabilities, potential future cyber-attacks, the weaknesses of existing measures, the levels of awareness and preparedness for future security challenges, and why security must play a key role underpinning the development of future smart manufacturing systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cyber-physical systems", "Design for manufacturing", "Information security", "Internet of Things", "Smart manufacturing", "Sustainable manufacturing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Design for Manufacturing", "Digital environment", "Individual technology", "Industrial espionage", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "Physical environments", "Smart manufacturing", "Sustainable manufacturing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045653026", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"14632806300": {"Name": "Tuptuk N.", "AuthorID": "14632806300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6602657397": {"Name": "Hailes S.", "AuthorID": "6602657397", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
