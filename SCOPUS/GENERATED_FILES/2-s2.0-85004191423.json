Current associations of macrophage activation syndrome with autoimmune disease most notably include a host of rheumatological conditions and inflammatory bowel disease. Epidemiological studies have shown that macrophage activation syndrome is precipitated by autoimmune disease more commonly than previously thought. Diagnosing the precipitating factor is essential for effective treatment and prognosis. Case presentation: We report a case of a six year old girl with coeliac disease diagnosed after two episodes of secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Her condition only responded to treatment once the patient was placed on a gluten free diet. Further immunological testing confirmed anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies, however histological biopsy was deemed inappropriate due to the severity of her condition. She has remained stable with no further episodes of macrophage activation syndrome since commencing a gluten free diet. Conclusion: This case report is the first literature that links macrophage activation syndrome to coeliac disease and highlights the challenge of diagnosing coeliac disease with unusual features such as associated prolonged fever. Clinicians should have a low threshold for screening children with other autoimmune diseases for coeliac disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmune disease", "Coeliac disease", "Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis", "Macrophage activation syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Celiac Disease", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic", "Macrophage Activation Syndrome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85004191423", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"]], "AuthorData": {"35422659500": {"Name": "Palman J.", "AuthorID": "35422659500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004749677": {"Name": "Pilkington C.", "AuthorID": "7004749677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57192307399": {"Name": "May J.", "AuthorID": "57192307399", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
