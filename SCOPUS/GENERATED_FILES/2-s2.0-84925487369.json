The structure, elemental proportion, and thermal properties of stabilised sol\u2013gel glasses have been characterised using X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR), titanium K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and differential thermal analysis (DTA). The XRD results confirmed the amorphous nature for all stabilized sol\u2013gel derived glasses. The EDX result shows the relatively low loss of phosphorus during the sol\u2013gel process and Ti K-edge XANES confirmed titanium in the glass structure is in mainly six-fold coordination environment. The 31P NMR and FTIR results revealed that the glass structure consist of mainly Q1 and Q2 phosphate units and the Ti4+ cation was acting as a cross-linking between phosphate units. In addition DTA results confirmed a decrease in the glass transition and crystallisation temperature with increasing Na2O content. Ion release studies also demonstrated a decrease in degradation rates with increasing TiO2 content therefore supporting the use of these glasses for biomedical applications that require a degree of control over glass degradation. These sol\u2013gel glasses also offer the potential to incorporate proactive molecules for drug delivery application due to the low synthesis temperature employed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["NMR", "Phosphate-based glass", "Sol\u2013gel synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical applications", "Coordination environment", "Differential thermal analyses (DTA)", "Drug delivery applications", "Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy", "Gel synthesis", "Synthesis temperatures", "X-ray absorption near-edge structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925487369", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55556089800": {"Name": "Foroutan F.", "AuthorID": "55556089800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202018577": {"Name": "Palmer G.", "AuthorID": "7202018577", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering/Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "56414252100": {"Name": "Owens G.J.", "AuthorID": "56414252100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering/Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60002877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nanobiomedical Science and BK21 PLUS NBM Global Research Center for Regenerative Medicine, Dankook University"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "de Leeuw N.H.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7501382403": {"Name": "Martin R.A.", "AuthorID": "7501382403", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing, Aston University"}, "56591525500": {"Name": "Kim H.W.", "AuthorID": "56591525500", "AffiliationID": "60170568", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomaterials Science, School of Dentistry, Dankook University"}}}
