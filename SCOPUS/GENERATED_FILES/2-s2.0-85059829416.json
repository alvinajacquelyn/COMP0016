KGaA, WeinheimAqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) have proved to be an efficient and integrative operation to enhance recovery of industrially relevant bioproducts. After ATPS discovery, a variety of works have been published regarding their scaling from 10 to 1000 L. Although ATPS have achieved high recovery and purity yields, there is still a gap between their bench-scale use and potential industrial applications. In this context, this review paper critically analyzes ATPS scale-up strategies to enhance the potential industrial adoption. In particular, large-scale operation considerations, different phase separation procedures, the available optimization techniques (univariate, response surface methodology, and genetic algorithms) to maximize recovery and purity and economic modeling to predict large-scale costs, are discussed. ATPS intensification to increase the amount of sample to process at each system, developing recycling strategies and creating highly efficient predictive models, are still areas of great significance that can be further exploited with the use of high-throughput techniques. Moreover, the development of novel ATPS can maximize their specificity increasing the possibilities for the future industry adoption of ATPS. This review work attempts to present the areas of opportunity to increase ATPS attractiveness at industrial levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aqueous two-phase systems", "bioprocess modeling", "novel ATPS", "optimization", "process scale-up"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aqueous two phase system", "Bioprocess modeling", "High-throughput technique", "Industrial adoption", "Optimization techniques", "Process scale-up", "Recycling strategy", "Response surface methodology", "Biotechnology", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059829416", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"55995858600": {"Name": "Torres-Acosta M.A.", "AuthorID": "55995858600", "AffiliationID": "60007966", "AffiliationName": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda y Ciencias"}, "23005697100": {"Name": "Mayolo-Deloisa K.", "AuthorID": "23005697100", "AffiliationID": "60007966", "AffiliationName": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda y Ciencias"}, "37016365200": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez-Valdez J.", "AuthorID": "37016365200", "AffiliationID": "60007966", "AffiliationName": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda y Ciencias"}, "6701641192": {"Name": "Rito-Palomares M.", "AuthorID": "6701641192", "AffiliationID": "60001285", "AffiliationName": "Tecnologico de Monterrey, Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud"}}}
