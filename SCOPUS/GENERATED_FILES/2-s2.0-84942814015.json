This study examined mRNA and protein levels of the signalling long-form leptin receptor (Ob-Rb) in fetal ovine lungs towards term, and after experimental manipulation of glucocorticoid levels in utero by fetal cortisol infusion ormaternal dexamethasone treatment. In fetal ovine lungs, Ob-Rb protein was localised to bronchiolar epithelium, bronchial cartilage, vascular endothelium, alveolar macrophages and type II pneumocytes. Pulmonary Ob-Rb mRNA abundance increased between 100 (0.69 fractional gestational age) and 144 days (0.99) of gestation, and by 2-4-fold in response to fetal cortisol infusion and maternal dexamethasone treatment. In contrast, pulmonary Ob-Rb protein levels decreased near term and were halved by glucocorticoid treatment, without any significant change in phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (pSTAT3) at Ser727, total STAT3 or the pulmonary pSTAT3: STAT3 ratio. LeptinmRNA was undetectable in fetal ovine lungs at the gestational ages studied. These findings demonstrate differential control of pulmonary Ob-Rb transcript abundance and protein translation, and/or post-translational processing, by glucocorticoids in utero. Localisation of Ob-Rb in the fetal ovine lungs, including alveolar type II pneumocytes, suggests a role for leptin signalling in the control of lung growth and maturation before birth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Alveolar Epithelial Cells", "Animals", "Dexamethasone", "Female", "Fetus", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Glucocorticoids", "Hydrocortisone", "Lung", "Phosphorylation", "Pregnancy", "Receptors, Leptin", "RNA, Messenger", "Sheep, Domestic", "Signal Transduction", "STAT3 Transcription Factor"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942814015", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6506608051": {"Name": "De Blasio M.J.", "AuthorID": "6506608051", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57194630402": {"Name": "Boije M.", "AuthorID": "57194630402", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "36060437600": {"Name": "Vaughan O.R.", "AuthorID": "36060437600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57215384217": {"Name": "Bernstein B.S.", "AuthorID": "57215384217", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "9333321100": {"Name": "Davies K.L.", "AuthorID": "9333321100", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "55578918400": {"Name": "Plein A.", "AuthorID": "55578918400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "7005673238": {"Name": "Wooding F.B.P.", "AuthorID": "7005673238", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "7005679494": {"Name": "Giussani D.A.", "AuthorID": "7005679494", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "7006204534": {"Name": "Fowden A.L.", "AuthorID": "7006204534", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "7004119961": {"Name": "Forhead A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004119961", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological and Medical Sciences, Oxford Brookes University"}, "6603238167": {"Name": "Kempster S.L.", "AuthorID": "6603238167", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, Rosie Hospital"}, "7406742171": {"Name": "Smith G.C.S.", "AuthorID": "7406742171", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, Rosie Hospital"}, "57215575828": {"Name": "Charnock-Jones D.S.", "AuthorID": "57215575828", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Cambridge, Rosie Hospital"}, "7006607370": {"Name": "Blache D.", "AuthorID": "7006607370", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "School of Animal Biology, University of Western Australia"}}}
