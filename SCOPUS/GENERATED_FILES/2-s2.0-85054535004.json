The complex and tightly regulated process of intestinal homeostasis is governed by a variety of signalling pathways that balance cell proliferation and differentiation. Accumulating evidence suggests that stem cell control and daughter cell fate determination is largely dictated by the microenvironment. Here, we review recent developments in the understanding of intestinal stem cell dynamics, focusing on the roles, mechanisms and interconnectivity of prime signalling pathways that regulate stem cell behaviour in intestinal homeostasis. Furthermore, we discuss how mutational activation of these signalling pathways endows colorectal cancer cells with niche-independent growth advantages during carcinogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Colorectal cancer", "Intestinal stem cells", "Microenvironment", "Signalling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Plasticity", "Cell Proliferation", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Intestinal Mucosa", "Intestinal Neoplasms", "Regeneration", "Signal Transduction", "Stem Cell Niche", "Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054535004", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"6506910593": {"Name": "Spit M.", "AuthorID": "6506910593", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology, Center for Molecular Medicine, UMC Utrecht"}, "7005922073": {"Name": "Maurice M.M.", "AuthorID": "7005922073", "AffiliationID": "120143085", "AffiliationName": "Oncode Institute"}, "8607696800": {"Name": "Koo B.K.", "AuthorID": "8607696800", "AffiliationID": "60008103", "AffiliationName": "IMBA \u2013 Institute of Molecular Biotechnology"}}}
