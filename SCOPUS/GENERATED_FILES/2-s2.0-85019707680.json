Here we show, through optimized colloidal synthesis, the tandem control of Pd size and site availability for the directed hydrogenation of the bioderived intermediate furfural. Adjusting the temperature of colloidal reduction dictates the size of Pd nanoparticles; in some instances ultrasmall clusters of <20 atoms are achieved. However, changing the solvent system affects the PVA-Pd interaction and relative proportion of available surface sites (corners, edges, planes), allowing us to control the selectivity to the valuable hydrogenation products furfuryl alcohol and tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. We demonstrate, through combined experimental and computational studies, that Pd nanoparticle planes are more prone to deactivation through the formation of Pd carbide, resulting in the reduced efficacy of furfural binding. This approach to nanoparticle optimization is an important strategy for producing long-lasting, high-performance catalysts for emerging sustainable technologies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clusters", "colloids", "furfural hydrogenation", "heterogeneous catalysis", "Pd carbide", "Pd nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Catalytic properties", "clusters", "Colloidal synthesis", "Computational studies", "Hydrogenation products", "PD nano particle", "Sustainable technology", "Tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019707680", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56204136500": {"Name": "Rogers S.M.", "AuthorID": "56204136500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56488383400": {"Name": "Catlow C.R.A.", "AuthorID": "56488383400", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "18633292200": {"Name": "Chutia A.", "AuthorID": "18633292200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56663288300": {"Name": "Perdjon M.", "AuthorID": "56663288300", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "22954736100": {"Name": "Thetford A.", "AuthorID": "22954736100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6507384807": {"Name": "Dimitratos N.", "AuthorID": "6507384807", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "7201597914": {"Name": "Villa A.", "AuthorID": "7201597914", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Chimica, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi di Milano"}, "7201752667": {"Name": "Wells P.P.", "AuthorID": "7201752667", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "35486894300": {"Name": "Chan-Thaw C.E.", "AuthorID": "35486894300", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Chimica, Universit\u00e0 Degli Studi di Milano"}, "6507868054": {"Name": "Jian N.", "AuthorID": "6507868054", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Nanoscale Physics Research Laboratory, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}, "7402727310": {"Name": "Palmer R.E.", "AuthorID": "7402727310", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Nanoscale Physics Research Laboratory, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham"}}}
