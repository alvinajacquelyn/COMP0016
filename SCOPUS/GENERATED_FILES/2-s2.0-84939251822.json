Nanoparticles were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analyses with thermogravimetry. Spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy analyses, and hydric and mechanical tests were also performed in stones specimens. Samples exposed to the yeast environment achieve 100 % relative CaCO3 yield, whereas at high humidity but without the yeast and under laboratory environment, relative yields of 95 % CaCO3 and 15 % CaCO3 are, respectively, reached, with white crusts and glazing left on the stone surfaces when the nanoparticles are applied at a concentration of 25 g/l. The largest increase in the drilling resistance and surface hardness values with slight increase in the capillarity absorption and desorption coefficients and with lesser stone color changes are produced at a concentration of 5 g/l, in the yeast system environment. This especially happens in stone specimens initially with bimodal pore size distributions, more amounts of pores with diameters between 0.1 and 1 \u00b5m, higher open porosity values and faster capillary coefficients. An inexpensive and reliable method based on water and yeast\u2013sugar solution is presented to speed up carbonation of Ca(OH)2 nanoparticles used as a consolidating product to improve the mechanical properties of decayed limestone from archaeological and architectural heritage.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Architectural heritage", "Bimodal pore size distribution", "Capillarity absorptions", "Laboratory environment", "Reliable methods", "Scanning electrons", "Surface hardness", "Yeast fermentation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939251822", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55884156400": {"Name": "Lopez-Arce P.", "AuthorID": "55884156400", "AffiliationID": "60104357", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Geociencias IGEO (CSIC,UCM)"}, "54394844700": {"Name": "Zornoza-Indart A.", "AuthorID": "54394844700", "AffiliationID": "60104357", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Geociencias IGEO (CSIC,UCM)"}}}
