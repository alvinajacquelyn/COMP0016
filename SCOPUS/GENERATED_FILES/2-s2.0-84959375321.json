Rather than an inexorable march to the beat of the neo-evolutionary drum, primary state formation in Egypt can be seen as a more syncopated phenomenon, characterized by periods of political experimentation and shifting social boundaries. Notably, field projects in Sudan and the Egyptian Delta together with new dating techniques have set older narratives of development into broader frames of reference. In contrast to syntheses that have sought to measure abstract thresholds of complexity, this review of the period between c. 4500 BC and c. 3000 BC transcends analytical categories by adopting a practice-based examination of multiple dimensions of social inequality and by considering how the early state may have become a lived reality in Egypt around the end of the fourth millennium BC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Kingship", "Neo-evolutionary theory", "Practice theory", "Predynastic Egypt", "Social complexity", "State formation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959375321", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"55937136900": {"Name": "Stevenson A.", "AuthorID": "55937136900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, University College London"}}}
