This project intended to verify whether the hypothesis of a UAV-based SLAM and 3D reconstruction system is practical. A GPS-Fused SLAM system is built based on ORB-SLAM. Inverse depth is also implemented to make the system suitable for a UAV-based platform. Meanwhile, REMODE is a depth filter and is tested as not being well enough as a dense mapping module. In the end, PMVS is implemented to build a dense map of the environment which produces a reasonable result. The small-scale-scene experiments produce the total error ratio of 5.60% in the x-y plane and 6.59% in the z axis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GPS", "PMVS", "SLAM", "UAV"], "IndexKeywords": ["3D reconstruction", "Depth filter", "Inverse-depth", "Mapping modules", "PMVS", "SLAM", "Small scale", "Total errors"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050017029", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"]], "AuthorData": {"57202970104": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "57202970104", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}, "6602657397": {"Name": "Hailes S.", "AuthorID": "6602657397", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}, "7003972937": {"Name": "Julier S.", "AuthorID": "7003972937", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Computer Science, University College London"}, "55512872300": {"Name": "Liu M.", "AuthorID": "55512872300", "AffiliationID": "60013983, 60008592, 60002798", "AffiliationName": "Robotics and Multi-perception Lab (RAM-LAB), ECEandCSE Department, HKUST, City University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen Research Institute"}}}
