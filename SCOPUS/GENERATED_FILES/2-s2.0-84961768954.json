A major drawback of sparse classifier learning is the lack of stability to data perturbations, which leads to different sets of features being selected. Here, we propose to use multi-task feature learning (MFL) to generate sparse and stable classifiers. In classification experiments on functional connectivity estimated from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that MFL more consistently selects the same connections across bootstrap samples and provides more interpretable models in multiclass settings than standard sparse classifiers, while achieving similar classification performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["functional connectivity", "Multi-task learning", "multiclass classification", "resting state fMRI", "sparse models"], "IndexKeywords": ["Functional connectivity", "Multi-class classification", "Multitask learning", "Resting-state fmri", "Sparse models"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961768954", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"24448145000": {"Name": "Altmann A.", "AuthorID": "24448145000", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Functional Imaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FIND) Lab, Stanford University"}, "15521369200": {"Name": "Ng B.", "AuthorID": "15521369200", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Functional Imaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders (FIND) Lab, Stanford University"}}}
