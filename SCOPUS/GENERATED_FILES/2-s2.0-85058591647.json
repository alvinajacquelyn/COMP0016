Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Five UK ENT Departments. Patients: Patients with surgically confirmed otosclerosis. Main Outcome Measures: Questionnaire data documented family history of otosclerosis, age of onset, medical history, and information on associated risk factors for 657 patients. Pre and post-surgical pure-tone audiometry was collected for 154 of these patients. Results: The age of onset, incidence of bilateral disease, tinnitus and vertigo, a higher prevalence of women (65%) than men (35%) are similar to those reported previously for otosclerosis cohorts. No association with measles infection was detected. Patients with a family history (40%) have an earlier age of onset and a higher incidence of bilateral disease and vertigo than non-familial subjects. Pedigree analysis is consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance being apparent in 44/91 pedigrees studied. Women who associate their hearing loss with pregnancy have an earlier age of onset than those that do not (p = 6 \u00d7 10-6). Conclusions: This study confirms that otosclerosis is an early adult onset disease that is more prevalent in women than men with a large minority of patients having a family history of otosclerosis. We report new evidence to support a relationship between pregnancy and otosclerosis progression in a proportion of women. In addition, this is the first study to identify differences in severity between familial and non-familial cases of otosclerosis, highlighting the possibility that more than one etiology may be involved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone remodeling", "Epidemiology", "Hearing loss", "Middle ear", "Otosclerosis", "Stapes surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Audiometry, Pure-Tone", "Child", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Otosclerosis", "Prevalence", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058591647", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57062188000": {"Name": "Crompton M.", "AuthorID": "57062188000", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Ear Institute, University College London"}, "6602493125": {"Name": "Cadge B.A.", "AuthorID": "6602493125", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Ear Institute, University College London"}, "56621435400": {"Name": "Ziff J.L.", "AuthorID": "56621435400", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Ear Institute, University College London"}, "57201912774": {"Name": "Mowat A.J.", "AuthorID": "57201912774", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7102086722": {"Name": "Saeed S.R.", "AuthorID": "7102086722", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "7202902185": {"Name": "Dawson S.J.", "AuthorID": "7202902185", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Ear Institute, University College London"}, "35094398700": {"Name": "Nash R.", "AuthorID": "35094398700", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "6603950399": {"Name": "Lavy J.A.", "AuthorID": "6603950399", "AffiliationID": "60029890", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital"}, "23668633400": {"Name": "Powell H.R.F.", "AuthorID": "23668633400", "AffiliationID": "60009797", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ear, Nose and Throat Surgery, Guy's Hospital"}, "8553727300": {"Name": "Aldren C.P.", "AuthorID": "8553727300", "AffiliationID": "120701931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ear, Nose and Throat Surgery, Princess Margaret Hospital"}}}
