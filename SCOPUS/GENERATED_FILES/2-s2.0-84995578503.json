We will discuss the history, methodological underpinnings, key contributions, and future directions for studying speech processing using TMS and by eliciting MEPs. Furthermore, we will discuss specific challenges that are encountered when examining speech processing using TMS or by measuring MEPs. We suggest that future research may benefit from using TMS in conjunction with neuroimaging methods such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging or electroencephalography, and from the development of new stimulation protocols addressing cortico-cortical inhibition/facilitation and interhemispheric connectivity during speech processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["comprehension", "MEP", "perception", "Speech", "TMS"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995578503", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"7801582665": {"Name": "Adank P.", "AuthorID": "7801582665", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "55764257400": {"Name": "Nuttall H.", "AuthorID": "55764257400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}, "56907048500": {"Name": "Kennedy-Higgins D.", "AuthorID": "56907048500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London"}}}
