The H -polychromatic number of G, denoted H, is the largest number of colors such that G has an H -polychromatic coloring. In this article, polyH(G) is determined exactly when G is a complete graph and H is the family of all 1-factors. In addition polyH(G) is found up to an additive constant term when G is a complete graph and H is the family of all 2-factors, or the family of all Hamiltonian cycles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1-factor", "2-factor", "hamiltonian cycle", "polychromatic coloring"], "IndexKeywords": ["1-factors", "2-factors", "Complete graphs", "Edge coloring", "Hamiltonian cycle", "Polychromatic colorings", "Subgraphs"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042154084", "SubjectAreas": [["Geometry and Topology", "MATH", "2608"]], "AuthorData": {"6602570886": {"Name": "Axenovich M.", "AuthorID": "6602570886", "AffiliationID": "60102538", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology"}, "7003537988": {"Name": "Goldwasser J.", "AuthorID": "7003537988", "AffiliationID": "60021143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, West Virginia University"}, "35179508100": {"Name": "Hansen R.", "AuthorID": "35179508100", "AffiliationID": "60021143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, West Virginia University"}, "24485259200": {"Name": "Lidick\u00fd B.", "AuthorID": "24485259200", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Iowa State University"}, "7501384160": {"Name": "Martin R.R.", "AuthorID": "7501384160", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Iowa State University"}, "37071422400": {"Name": "Young M.", "AuthorID": "37071422400", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Iowa State University"}, "55585978900": {"Name": "Offner D.", "AuthorID": "55585978900", "AffiliationID": "60031915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Westminster College"}, "7202205812": {"Name": "Talbot J.", "AuthorID": "7202205812", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
