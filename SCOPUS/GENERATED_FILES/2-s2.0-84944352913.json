We tested the utility of the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 in prodromal Huntington disease. Using data from 726 participants and 630 companions over a 3-year follow-up, linear mixed models were fitted to test (1) baseline and longitudinal differences by progression group; (2) participant and companion differences within each group; and (3) sensitivity of the 12-item WHODAS in comparison to the 36-item WHODAS and the Total Functional Capacity (TFC) score from the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. Participants showed baseline group differences whereas companions showed baseline and longitudinal group differences. Companions reported worse functional decline over time than participants as the disease progresses. The 12-item WHODAS detected longitudinal change better than the 36-item WHODAS and the TFC in the medium progression group. Results suggest the 12-item WHODAS 2.0 can detect baseline and longitudinal differences in prodromal HD and may be useful in HD clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Huntington Disease", "World Health Organization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944352913", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55910529800": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "55910529800", "AffiliationID": "60009788, 60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa"}, "7403447437": {"Name": "Long J.", "AuthorID": "7403447437", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of Iowa"}, "8585658900": {"Name": "Mills J.", "AuthorID": "8585658900", "AffiliationID": "60009788, 60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa"}, "7102109661": {"Name": "Paulsen J.", "AuthorID": "7102109661", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Iowa"}, "23993818800": {"Name": "Downing N.", "AuthorID": "23993818800", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, University of Iowa"}, "57203600846": {"Name": "Williams J.", "AuthorID": "57203600846", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "College of Nursing, University of Iowa"}}}
