However, there are impediments to our ability to fully understand this measurement, including matrix interference and changes linked to apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u03b54 genotype. This study investigated matrix interference as a contributing factor for detecting AD in APOE \u03b54-negative patients by comparing total extractable A\u03b21-42 to free A\u03b21-42. It also examined the ratio of total A\u03b21-42 to A\u03b21-40, since changes relative to other A\u03b2 peptides may provide a measurement of cerebral \u03b2-amyloidosis that is neutral to changes in APP metabolism. Total A\u03b21-42 lost the diagnostic power for detecting AD, confirming a role for matrix in the diagnostic. However, when total A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21-40 was examined, the separation between groups was reestablished. This result was confirmed in a second sample set of unknown APOE status. These results confirmed that matrix interference in some cerebrospinal fluid samples appears to contribute to identifying AD patients and this can be compensated by using a total extracted A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21-40 ratio when matrix interference is small. It may be preferable to employ a total A\u03b21-42/A\u03b21-40 measurement, since this could minimize variability because of matrix and compensate for across patient differences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A\u03b2 peptide ratio", "biomarker", "CSF", "HPLC", "immunoassay"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mild Cognitive Impairment", "Peptide Fragments", "ROC Curve", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954557894", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6603768077": {"Name": "Slemmon J.R.", "AuthorID": "6603768077", "AffiliationID": "60027736", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Biomarkers, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies"}, "57061643200": {"Name": "Shapiro A.", "AuthorID": "57061643200", "AffiliationID": "60027736", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Biomarkers, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology University College London"}, "7004314974": {"Name": "Mercken M.", "AuthorID": "7004314974", "AffiliationID": "60068574", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Discovery, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies"}, "6602172091": {"Name": "Streffer J.", "AuthorID": "6602172091", "AffiliationID": "60068574", "AffiliationName": "Experimental Medicine, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies"}, "56371398100": {"Name": "Romano G.", "AuthorID": "56371398100", "AffiliationID": "60027736", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen Research and Development"}, "7102011511": {"Name": "Andreasen N.", "AuthorID": "7102011511", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, M51 Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}}}
