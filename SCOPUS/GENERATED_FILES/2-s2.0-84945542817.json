Here, we find that the adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) mediates trafficking of CaV2.2 from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface. Examination of splice variants of CaV2.2, containing either exon 37a (selectively expressed in nociceptors) or 37b in the proximal C terminus, reveal that canonical AP-1 binding motifs, Yxx\u03a6and [DE]xxxL[LI], present only in exon 37a, enhance intracellular trafficking of exon 37a-containing CaV2.2 to the axons and plasma membrane of rat DRG neurons. Finally, we identify differential effects of dopamine-2 receptor (D2R) and its agonist-induced activation on trafficking of CaV2.2 isoforms. D2R slowed the endocytosis of CaV2.2 containing exon 37b, but not exon 37a, and activation by the agonist quinpirole reversed the effect of the D2R. Our work thus reveals key mechanisms involved in the trafficking of N-type calcium channels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptor protein", "Calcium channel", "Dopamine receptor", "Electrophysiology", "G-protein-coupled receptor", "Trafficking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Protein Complex 1", "Alternative Splicing", "Axons", "Brefeldin A", "Calcium Channels, N-Type", "Cell Line", "Cell Membrane", "Endocytosis", "Exons", "Ganglia, Spinal", "Golgi Apparatus", "Humans", "Neurons", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors", "Receptors, Dopamine D2", "Transfection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84945542817", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56928307300": {"Name": "Macabuag N.", "AuthorID": "56928307300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "24498942300": {"Name": "Dolphin A.", "AuthorID": "24498942300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
