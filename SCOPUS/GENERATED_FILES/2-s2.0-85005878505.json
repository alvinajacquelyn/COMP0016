All rights reserved.Haemodynamic forces appear to play an influential role in the evolution of aneurysms. This has led to numerous studies, usually based on computational fluid dynamics. Their focus is predominantly on the wall shear stress (WSS) and associated derived parameters, attempting to find correlations between particular patterns of haemodynamic indices and regions subjected to disease formation and progression. The indices are generally determined by integration of flow properties over a single cardiac cycle. In this study, we illustrate that in some cases the transitional flow in aneurysms can lead to significantly different WSS distributions in consecutive cardiac cycles. Accurate determination of time-averaged haemodynamic indices may thus require simulation of a large number of cycles, which contrasts with the common approach to determine parameters using data from a single cycle. To demonstrate the role of transitional flow, two exemplary cases are considered: flow in an abdominal aortic aneurysm and in an intracranial aneurysm. The key differences that are observed between these cases are explained in terms of the integral timescale of the transitional flows in comparison with the cardiac cycle duration: for relatively small geometries, transients will decay before the next cardiac cycle. In larger geometries, transients are still present when the systolic phase produces new instabilities. These residual fluctuations serve as random initial conditions and thus seed different flow patterns in each cycle. To judge whether statistics are converged, the derived indices from at least two successive cardiac cycles should be compared.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aneurysms", "Computational fluid dynamics", "Haemodynamics", "Transitional flow"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdominal aortic aneurysms", "Aneurysms", "Derived parameters", "Haemodynamics", "Intracranial aneurysms", "Random initial conditions", "Transitional flow", "Wall shear stress", "Aneurysm", "Computer Simulation", "Heart", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Models, Cardiovascular", "Shear Strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85005878505", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"6506021654": {"Name": "Poelma C.", "AuthorID": "6506021654", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Aero and Hydrodynamics, Delft University of Technology"}, "7801599720": {"Name": "Watton P.N.", "AuthorID": "7801599720", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60183164", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, INSIGNEO Institute of In Silico Medicine, University of Sheffield"}, "6603704133": {"Name": "Ventikos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603704133", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
