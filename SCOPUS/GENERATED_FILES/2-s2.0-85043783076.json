The third variable (V3) loop of HIV-1 gp120 is an immunodominant region targeted by neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). Despite limited breadth, better characterization of the structural details of the interactions between these nAbs and their target epitopes would enhance our understanding of the mechanism of neutralization and facilitate designing better immunogens to induce nAbs with greater breadth. Recently, we isolated two anti-V3 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 10A3 and 10A37, from a rabbit immunized with gp120 of the M group consensus sequence. In this study, crystal structures of these MAbs bound to target epitopes were determined. 10A3 binds to the V3 crown ( 303 TRKSIHIGPGRAF 317 ) using the cradle binding mode, similar to human V3 MAbs encoded by IGHV5-51 germ line genes, and its epitope structure resembles that bound to the human antibodies. In contrast, 10A37, which exhibits greater breadth and potency than 10A3, binds the V3 crown and the succeeding stem region ( 308 HIGPGRAFYTTGEI323). Unexpectedly, the 315 RAFYTT 320 portion of the epitope existed as helical turns, a V3 structure that has not been observed previously. Its main chain-dominated antigen-antibody interactions not only explain the broad neutralization of 10A37 but also show that its epitope is a potential vaccine target to be further evaluated. In conclusion, our study provides novel insights about neutralization-susceptible epitope structures of the V3 loop of HIV-1 gp120 and demonstrates that, despite low amino acid sequence similarity to human antibody germ line genes, rabbits can serve as a useful animal model to evaluate human vaccine candidates.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gp120", "HIV-1", "Neutralizing antibody", "V3", "V3 loop"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Antibody Affinity", "Antibody Formation", "Epitopes", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Envelope Protein gp120", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Neutralization Tests", "Protein Conformation", "Rabbits"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043783076", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"36121151700": {"Name": "Pan R.", "AuthorID": "36121151700", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU School of Medicine"}, "26651861200": {"Name": "Kong X.P.", "AuthorID": "26651861200", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, NYU School of Medicine"}, "56297136600": {"Name": "Qin Y.", "AuthorID": "56297136600", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Iowa State University"}, "56366623900": {"Name": "Banasik M.", "AuthorID": "56366623900", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Iowa State University"}, "57210010118": {"Name": "Cho M.W.", "AuthorID": "57210010118", "AffiliationID": "60004354", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences, Iowa State University"}, "36138581400": {"Name": "Lees W.", "AuthorID": "36138581400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "36118495000": {"Name": "Shepherd A.J.", "AuthorID": "36118495000", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, Birkbeck College, University of London"}}}
