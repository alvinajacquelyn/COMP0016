All rights reserved.Renaming disorders to change public beliefs and attitudes remains controversial. This study compared the potentially destigmatising effects of renaming schizophrenia with the effects of renaming bipolar disorder by comparing the label 'schizophrenia' to 'integration disorder', and 'bipolar disorder' to 'manic depression', in 1621 lay participants. 'Bipolar disorder' was associated with less fear and social distance than 'manic depression'. 'Integration disorder' was associated with increased endorsement of a biopsychosocial cause and reduced attributions of dangerousness but also increased social distance, highlighting the complex effects renaming has on stigma.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bipolar Disorder", "Emotions", "Humans", "Prognosis", "Schizophrenia", "Social Distance", "Social Perception", "Social Stigma", "Stereotyping", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Terminology as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928004845", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57217718132": {"Name": "Ellison N.", "AuthorID": "57217718132", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7004241930": {"Name": "Mason O.", "AuthorID": "7004241930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "6507888355": {"Name": "Scior K.", "AuthorID": "6507888355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
