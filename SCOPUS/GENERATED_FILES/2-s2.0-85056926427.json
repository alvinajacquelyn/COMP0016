We previously identified ER domains in S. cerevisiae containing the reticulon homology domain (RHD) protein Pex30 that are regions where preperoxisomal vesicles (PPVs) form. Here, we show that Pex30 domains are also sites where most nascent LDs form. Mature LDs usually remain associated with Pex30 subdomains, and the same Pex30 subdomain can simultaneously associate with a LD and a PPV or peroxisome. We find that in higher eukaryotes multiple C2 domain containing transmembrane protein (MCTP2) is similar to Pex30: it contains an RHD and resides in ER domains where most nascent LD biogenesis occurs and that often associate with peroxisomes. Together, these findings indicate that most LDs and PPVs form and remain associated with conserved ER subdomains, and suggest a link between LD and peroxisome biogenesis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins", "Diacylglycerol O-Acyltransferase", "Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Gene Deletion", "GTP-Binding Protein gamma Subunits", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Lipid Droplets", "Membrane Proteins", "Membrane Transport Proteins", "Methyltransferases", "Mutation", "Organelle Biogenesis", "Peroxisomes", "Protein Domains", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056926427", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57210528865": {"Name": "Joshi A.", "AuthorID": "57210528865", "AffiliationID": "60008438, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH"}, "57204438552": {"Name": "Nebenfuehr B.", "AuthorID": "57204438552", "AffiliationID": "60008438, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH"}, "35204596900": {"Name": "Choudhary V.", "AuthorID": "35204596900", "AffiliationID": "60008438, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH"}, "7007017489": {"Name": "Golden A.", "AuthorID": "7007017489", "AffiliationID": "60008438, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH"}, "7005550500": {"Name": "Prinz W.", "AuthorID": "7005550500", "AffiliationID": "60008438, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIH"}, "8937074700": {"Name": "Satpute-Krishnan P.", "AuthorID": "8937074700", "AffiliationID": "60006762", "AffiliationName": "Uniformed Services, University of the Health Sciences"}, "7102551297": {"Name": "Levine T.", "AuthorID": "7102551297", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
