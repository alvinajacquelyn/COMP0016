It is not clear, however, how these oscillations relate to functional processing at different linguistic hierarchical levels. Using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), the current study tested the hypothesis that phonological and the higher-level linguistic (semantic/syntactic) organizations during auditory sentence processing are indexed by distinct EEG signatures derived from the \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b2, and \u03b3 oscillations. We analyzed specific EEG signatures while subjects listened to Mandarin speech stimuli in three different conditions in order to dissociate phonological and semantic/syntactic processing: (1) sentences comprising valid disyllabic words assembled in a valid syntactic structure (real-word condition); (2) utterances with morphologically valid syllables, but not constituting valid disyllabic words (pseudo-word condition); and (3) backward versions of the real-word and pseudo-word conditions. We tested four signatures: band power, EEG-acoustic entrainment (EAE), cross-frequency coupling (CFC), and inter-electrode renormalized partial directed coherence (rPDC). The results show significant effects of band power and EAE of \u03b4 and \u03b8 oscillations for phonological, rather than semantic/syntactic processing, indicating the importance of tracking \u03b4- and \u03b8-rate phonetic patterns during phonological analysis. We also found significant \u03b2-related effects, suggesting tracking of EEG to the acoustic stimulus (high-\u03b2 EAE), memory processing (\u03b8-low-\u03b2 CFC), and auditory-motor interactions (20-Hz rPDC) during phonological analysis. For semantic/syntactic processing, we obtained a significant effect of \u03b3 power, suggesting lexical memory retrieval or processing grammatical word categories. Based on these findings, we confirm that scalp EEG signatures relevant to \u03b4, \u03b8, \u03b2, and \u03b3 oscillations can index phonological and semantic/syntactic organizations separately in auditory sentence processing, compatible with the view that phonological and higher-level linguistic processing engage distinct neural networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Auditory sentence", "Brain oscillations", "EEG", "Phonological processing", "Semantic processing", "Syntactic processing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Auditory Cortex", "Auditory Perception", "Biological Clocks", "Brain Waves", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nerve Net", "Phonetics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Semantics", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962735548", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36240527900": {"Name": "Mai G.", "AuthorID": "36240527900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Speech Research Lab, Experimental Psychology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "6603216969": {"Name": "Minett J.", "AuthorID": "6603216969", "AffiliationID": "60002798", "AffiliationName": "Joint Research Centre for Language and Human Complexity, Faculty of Arts, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"}, "35726254300": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "35726254300", "AffiliationID": "60008928", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studies, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University"}}}
