However, significant uncertainty remains over the evolution of Earth\u2019s early nitrogen cycle, particularly how and when it responded to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. Here we apply multi-proxy geochemical analyses (Fe speciation, \u03b413C and \u03b415N) to exceptionally well-preserved shales from the approximately 2.7 billion year old Manjeri Formation in the Belingwe Greenstone Belt, Zimbabwe, to evaluate the redox status of Earth\u2019s early nitrogen cycle and decipher feedbacks associated with the initial stages of planetary oxygenation. These continental shelf sediments were previously linked to early cyanobacterial oxygen production, and provide a direct test of conflicting hypotheses concerning the importance of nitrogen oxyanions in the Late Archaean era. Our data reveal a dominantly anaerobic marine nitrogen cycle in which ammonium-replete ferruginous waters underlay an ephemeral oxygen oasis. Driven by the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis, increased primary productivity could have periodically strengthened export production, which allowed for the accumulation of ammonium in the water column during organic matter degradation. Restricted oxygen availability could have allowed the upwelling ammonium to reach the photic zone to provide ample nitrogen to fuel a prolific Late Archaean biosphere.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066097990", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57208908128": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "57208908128", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences and Centre for Exoplanet Science, University of St Andrews, St Andrews"}, "26640420300": {"Name": "Izon G.", "AuthorID": "26640420300", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth, Atmospheric & Planetary Sciences, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "57193730871": {"Name": "Mettam C.", "AuthorID": "57193730871", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences and Centre for Exoplanet Science, University of St Andrews, St Andrews"}, "12244468800": {"Name": "Zerkle A.L.", "AuthorID": "12244468800", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences and Centre for Exoplanet Science, University of St Andrews, St Andrews"}, "8353425300": {"Name": "Junium C.K.", "AuthorID": "8353425300", "AffiliationID": "60030551", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Syracuse University, Heroy Geology Laboratory"}, "6602459824": {"Name": "Grassineau N.V.", "AuthorID": "6602459824", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "7006408552": {"Name": "Nisbet E.G.", "AuthorID": "7006408552", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "34872733500": {"Name": "Martin A.", "AuthorID": "34872733500", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
