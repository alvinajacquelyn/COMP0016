Avoidance of corticosteroids in immunosuppressive regimens may have beneficial effects in terms of reducing the incidence of infection, new onset diabetes mellitus and HCV recurrence however perioperative use may have beneficial effects such as attenuation of ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IR) and treatment of underlying adrenal insufficiency (AI). Due to a high prevalence of adrenal insufficiency in patients on our waiting list for LT, we reintroduced the use of intraoperative methyl-prednisolone and hypothesised that this would improve early post operative outcome. Material/Methods: 90 consecutive patients were studied, 45 before (group 1) and 45 (group 2) after the protocolised reintroduc-tion of methylprednisolone (1g IV) intraoperatively prior to reperfusion. Peri- and post-transplant requirements for colloid, crystalloid, blood products, vasopressors, renal replacement therapy and ventilation were compared between groups. No other changes to the transplant protocol occurred during the study period. Results: Patients who received intraoperative methlyprednisolone had significantly shorter post operative ITU stay, va-sopressor and colloid requirement post LT, and were dependent on mechanical ventilation for less time. Conclusions: These data suggest that the use of intraoperative methylprednisolone can modify the immediate post transplant course of LT, either by attenuating reperfusion induced inflammation, or by addressing hitherto unrecognized adrenal insufficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adrenal insufficiency", "Intensive care", "Liver transplantation", "Methylprednisolone", "Reperfusion injury", "Vasoconstrictor agents"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Intensive Care", "Intraoperative Care", "Liver Transplantation", "Male", "Methylprednisolone", "Middle Aged", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922566616", "SubjectAreas": [["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"56512312200": {"Name": "Daker C.", "AuthorID": "56512312200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, The Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and University, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55783077900": {"Name": "Dannhorn E.H.", "AuthorID": "55783077900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, The Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and University, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56511475300": {"Name": "See L.M.", "AuthorID": "56511475300", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, The Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and University, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56376542600": {"Name": "O\u2019Beirne J.", "AuthorID": "56376542600", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, The Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre and University, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55246198700": {"Name": "Patel S.", "AuthorID": "55246198700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital"}, "26632738100": {"Name": "Broomhead R.", "AuthorID": "26632738100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7004053133": {"Name": "Mallett S.", "AuthorID": "7004053133", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
