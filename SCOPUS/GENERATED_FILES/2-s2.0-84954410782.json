Method: Retrospective analysis of 30 cases of childhood PCAIS identified from two tertiary centres over 11 years. Clinical and demographic details were recorded. Brain and cerebrovascular imaging were reviewed. Aetiology was classified using the Childhood Arterial Ischaemic Stroke Standardized Classification and Diagnostic Evaluation criteria. Outcome was evaluated using standardized paediatric stroke outcome scores. Logistic regression was used to explore variables associated with diagnosis. Results: Twenty-three patients were male (77%) and 7 were female (23%). VAD was the most commonly identified aetiology, in 15 cases (50%). Aetiology was undetermined in 12 (40%), probable cardioembolism in two, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome in one. In those with VAD, diagnosis was made on initial magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in six (40%). Further cases of VAD were diagnosed with catheter angiography (n=6), computed tomographic angiography (n=1), or follow-up MRA (n=2). Presence of multiple infarcts was associated with a diagnosis of VAD. Interpretation: Endoluminal cerebrovascular imaging increases the rate of diagnosis of VAD in childhood PCAIS and should especially be considered if there are multiple infarcts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Brain Ischemia", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Stroke", "Vertebral Artery Dissection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954410782", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55671204900": {"Name": "Mccrea N.", "AuthorID": "55671204900", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7202074854": {"Name": "Saunders D.", "AuthorID": "7202074854", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "42160994800": {"Name": "Bagkeris E.", "AuthorID": "42160994800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55757561400": {"Name": "Chitre M.", "AuthorID": "55757561400", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Addenbrooke's Hospital"}, "7102334584": {"Name": "Ganesan V.", "AuthorID": "7102334584", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
