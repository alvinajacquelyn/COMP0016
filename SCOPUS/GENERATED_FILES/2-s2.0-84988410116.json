The journal Hippocampus has passed the milestone of 25 years of publications on the topic of a highly studied brain structure, and its closely associated brain areas. In a recent celebration of this event, a Boston memory group invited 16 speakers to address the question of progress in understanding the hippocampus that has been achieved. Here we present a summary of these talks organized as progress on four main themes: (1) Understanding the hippocampus in terms of its interactions with multiple cortical areas within the medial temporal lobe memory system, (2) understanding the relationship between memory and spatial information processing functions of the hippocampal region, (3) understanding the role of temporal organization in spatial and memory processing by the hippocampus, and (4) understanding how the hippocampus integrates related events into networks of memories. \u00a9 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["declarative memory", "hippocampus", "memory integration", "navigation", "place cells", "time cells"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988410116", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"7006406842": {"Name": "Eichenbaum H.", "AuthorID": "7006406842", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Center for Memory and Brain and Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, Boston University"}, "7007019852": {"Name": "Amaral D.G.", "AuthorID": "7007019852", "AffiliationID": "60114314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and UC Davis Mind Institute"}, "6603939219": {"Name": "Ranganath C.", "AuthorID": "6603939219", "AffiliationID": "60114314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and UC Davis Mind Institute"}, "6603547332": {"Name": "Buffalo E.A.", "AuthorID": "6603547332", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington"}, "7006676856": {"Name": "Buzs\u00e1ki G.", "AuthorID": "7006676856", "AffiliationID": "60024541", "AffiliationName": "Deparment of Neuroscience and Physiology and NYU Neuroscience Institute, New York University Medical School"}, "7401790080": {"Name": "Cohen N.", "AuthorID": "7401790080", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Department and Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign"}, "6603661530": {"Name": "Davachi L.", "AuthorID": "6603661530", "AffiliationID": "102035585", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, New York Institute"}, "7201908052": {"Name": "Frank L.", "AuthorID": "7201908052", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Center for Integrative Neuroscience, University of California, San Francisco"}, "57200804085": {"Name": "Heckers S.", "AuthorID": "57200804085", "AffiliationID": "60006475", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine"}, "7404059483": {"Name": "Morris R.G.M.", "AuthorID": "7404059483", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive and Neural Systems,The University of Edinburgh"}, "7203026294": {"Name": "Moser E.I.", "AuthorID": "7203026294", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "7004548881": {"Name": "Witter M.", "AuthorID": "7004548881", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience and Centre for Neural Computation, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "35478813600": {"Name": "Nadel L.", "AuthorID": "35478813600", "AffiliationID": "60010065", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Arizona"}, "35478840000": {"Name": "O'Keefe J.", "AuthorID": "35478840000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7102344440": {"Name": "Preston A.", "AuthorID": "7102344440", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Center for Learning and Memory, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of Texas at Austin"}, "57200442248": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "57200442248", "AffiliationID": "60027550", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Brain Research Institute, University of California, Los Angeles"}}}
