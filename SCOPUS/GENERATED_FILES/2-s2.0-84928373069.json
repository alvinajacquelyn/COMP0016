Published by Taylor & Francis.Semantic dementia is a unique clinicopathological syndrome in the frontotemporal lobar degeneration spectrum. It is characterized by progressive and relatively selective impairment of semantic memory, associated with asymmetric antero-inferior temporal lobe atrophy. Although the syndrome became widely recognized only in the 1980s, descriptions of cases with typical features of semantic dementia have been on record for over a century. Here, we draw attention to a well documented historical case of a patient with features that would have fulfilled current consensus criteria for semantic dementia, as reconstructed from the notes made by her neurologist, Macdonald Critchley, in 1938. This case raises a number of issues concerning the nosology of the semantic dementia syndrome and the potential value of archived case material.", "AuthorKeywords": ["historical", "Macdonald Critchley", "nosology", "semantic dementia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "History, 20th Century", "Humans", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928373069", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36703546000": {"Name": "Witoonpanich P.", "AuthorID": "36703546000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602191607": {"Name": "Crutch S.", "AuthorID": "6602191607", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35557252600": {"Name": "Warren J.", "AuthorID": "35557252600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7103182857": {"Name": "Rossor M.", "AuthorID": "7103182857", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
