Assuming a Markov dynamics for both mechanisms, we propose an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for model estimation and inference of the latent variables. The estimated parameters and fitnesses can be used to forecast the presence of a link in the future. We apply our methodology to the e-MID interbank network for which the two linkage mechanisms are associated with two different trading behaviors in the process of network formation, namely preferential trading and trading driven by node-specific characteristics. The empirical results allow to recognize preferential lending in the interbank market and indicate how a method that does not account for time-varying network topologies tends to overestimate preferential linkage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Expectation-Maximization", "Interbank market", "Link prediction", "Markov processes", "Temporal networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dynamic network modeling", "Estimated parameter", "Expectation - maximizations", "Expectation-maximization algorithms", "Interbank market", "Link prediction", "Network formation", "Temporal networks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069723386", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"]], "AuthorData": {"57205405878": {"Name": "Mazzarisi P.", "AuthorID": "57205405878", "AffiliationID": "60030674", "AffiliationName": "Scuola Normale Superiore"}, "57203233459": {"Name": "Lillo F.", "AuthorID": "57203233459", "AffiliationID": "60030674", "AffiliationName": "Scuola Normale Superiore"}, "55324091300": {"Name": "Tantari D.", "AuthorID": "55324091300", "AffiliationID": "60021859", "AffiliationName": "DISEI, University of Florence"}, "56121765800": {"Name": "Barucca P.", "AuthorID": "56121765800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
