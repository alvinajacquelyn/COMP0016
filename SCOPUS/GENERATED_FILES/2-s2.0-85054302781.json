However, the sex-specific aetiology of cardiovascular health across childhood and adolescence is poorly understood. Methods: We examined sex differences in trajectories of 11 measures of cardiovascular health from birth to 18 years, in a contemporary birth cohort study in England (N participants per outcomes: 662-13,985, N repeated measures per outcome: 1,831-112,768). Outcomes were measured over varying time spans from birth or mid-childhood to age 18 and with different numbers of repeated measures per outcome. Analyses were performed using fractional polynomial and linear spline multilevel models. Results: Females had higher mean BMI, height-adjusted fat mass, pulse rate, insulin, triglycerides, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) and lower mean height-adjusted lean mass from birth or from mid-childhood to age 18. For example, mean non-HDL-c was 0.07 mmol/l (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.04, 0.10) higher in females compared with males at birth. By age 18, this difference persisted and widened to 0.19 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.16, 0.23) higher non-HDL-c in females compared with males. Females had lower levels of glucose from mid-childhood and developed lower systolic blood pressure and higher HDL-c from mid-adolescence onward. For example, females had 0.08 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.05, 0.10) lower mean glucose compared with males at age seven which widened to a difference of 0.22 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.25, 0.19) at age 18. Conclusions: Sex differences in measures of cardiovascular health are apparent from birth or mid-childhood and change during early life. These differences may have implications for sex-specific disease risk in future adult populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Cardiovascular", "Childhood", "Longitudinal", "Sex-specific"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anthropometry", "Biomarkers", "Blood Pressure", "Body Mass Index", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cardiovascular System", "Child", "Cholesterol", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin", "Lipids", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Triglycerides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054302781", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56153764000": {"Name": "O'Keeffe L.M.", "AuthorID": "56153764000", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School"}, "7004134399": {"Name": "Tilling K.", "AuthorID": "7004134399", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School"}, "55576669200": {"Name": "Anderson E.L.", "AuthorID": "55576669200", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School"}, "57206515095": {"Name": "Lawlor D.A.", "AuthorID": "57206515095", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School"}, "55770838500": {"Name": "Fraser A.", "AuthorID": "55770838500", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School"}, "14630195700": {"Name": "Howe L.D.", "AuthorID": "14630195700", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Sciences, Bristol Medical School"}, "48661335800": {"Name": "Simpkin A.J.", "AuthorID": "48661335800", "AffiliationID": "60008539", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics, National University of Ireland"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing at University College London"}}}
