The concept of mode projection has been introduced as a means to remove contaminants for which it is possible to construct a spatial map, reflecting the expected signal contribution. Owing to its computational efficiency compared to minimum-variance methods, the sub-optimal pseudo-C\u2113 (PCL) power spectrum estimator is a popular tool for the analysis of high-resolution data sets. Here, we integrate mode projection into the framework of PCL power spectrum estimation. In contrast to results obtained with optimal estimators, we show that the uncorrected projection of template maps leads to biased power spectra. Based on analytical calculations, we find exact closed-form expressions for the expectation value of the bias and demonstrate that they can be recast in a form which allows a numerically efficient evaluation, preserving the favourable O(\u21133max ) time complexity of PCL estimator algorithms. Using simulated data sets, we assess the scaling of the bias with various analysis parameters and demonstrate that it can be reliably removed. We conclude that in combination with mode projection, PCL estimators allow for a fast and robust computation of power spectra in the presence of systematic effects - properties in high demand for the analysis of ongoing and future large-scale structure surveys.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: observations", "Large-scale structure of Universe", "Methods: data analysis", "Methods: numerical", "Methods: statistical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032477262", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"23469136100": {"Name": "Elsner F.", "AuthorID": "23469136100", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Astrophysik"}, "55151435200": {"Name": "Leistedt B.", "AuthorID": "55151435200", "AffiliationID": "60029600, 60021784", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics, Department of Physics, New York University"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics, Stockholm University"}}}
