For this reason, approximated model structures are normally employed instead of the comprehensive ones. The estimation of parameters in an incorrect model is not a trivial task. The expected information for the estimation of the model parameters is evaluated through the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). Model-based design of experiments (MBDoE) methods for parameter precision do not take into account the structural model uncertainty in the formulation of FIM-based information metrics. In this work, an Extended FIM (E-FIM) is proposed, which carries information about the incorrect model structure. Its properties are discussed through its application on a simulated case with a biomass growth model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fisher information", "MBDoE", "parameter precision", "structural uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041598477", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57194192459": {"Name": "Quaglio M.", "AuthorID": "57194192459", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7006429775": {"Name": "Fraga E.", "AuthorID": "7006429775", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "25029440500": {"Name": "Galvanin F.", "AuthorID": "25029440500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
