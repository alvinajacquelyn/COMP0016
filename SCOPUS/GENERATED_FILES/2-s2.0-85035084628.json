Specifically we present the case of antimalarial compounds and demonstrate that the flow chemistry community have already designed both a machine capable of distrubuted chemical manufacturing and a module that would be capable of producing artemisin derivatives at the point of use.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antimalarial compounds", "Chemical manufacturing", "Continuous-flow synthesis", "Distributed manufacturing", "Flow chemistry", "Infectious pathogens", "Point of use", "Resistant strains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035084628", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Chemical Engineering (miscellaneous)", "CENG", "1501"], ["Process Chemistry and Technology", "CENG", "1508"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"57190022638": {"Name": "Howard J.", "AuthorID": "57190022638", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University Main Building"}, "56945497900": {"Name": "Schotten C.", "AuthorID": "56945497900", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University Main Building"}, "23018311500": {"Name": "Browne D.", "AuthorID": "23018311500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University Main Building"}}}
