We aim to maximize the harvested energy by the ERs while maintaining the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) threshold at the IR and keeping the message secure from possible eavesdropping by the ERs by suppressing their SINRs. Both scenarios of perfect and imperfect channel state information at the transmitter are studied. Using semidefinite relaxation techniques, we show that there always exists a rank-one optimal solution for the IR, i.e., transmit beamforming is optimal for the IR.", "AuthorKeywords": ["energy harvesting", "Robust", "secrecy", "SWIPT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Imperfect channel state information", "Information and power transfers", "Multi-antenna transmitters", "Multiple input single outputs", "Robust", "secrecy", "Signal-to-interference and noise ratios", "SWIPT"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027919487", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36632507800": {"Name": "Khandaker M.", "AuthorID": "36632507800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
