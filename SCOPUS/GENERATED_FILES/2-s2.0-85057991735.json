A conjecture put forward by Kudla relates these derivatives to arithmetic intersections of special cycles, and our results settle the part of his conjecture involving local archimedean heights.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057991735", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"57189756977": {"Name": "Garcia L.", "AuthorID": "57189756977", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Toronto"}, "56417366800": {"Name": "Sankaran S.", "AuthorID": "56417366800", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Manitoba"}}}
