Cholinergic fibers innervate hippocampal neuron axons, dendrites, and somata. The effects of acetylcholine on axonal information processing, though, remain unknown. By stimulating cholinergic fibers and making electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells, we show that synaptically released acetylcholine preferentially lowered the action potential threshold, enhancing intrinsic excitability and synaptic potential-spike coupling. These effects persisted for at least 30min after the stimulation paradigm and were due to muscarinic receptor activation. This caused sustained elevation of axonal intracellular Ca2+ via T-type Ca2+ channels, as indicated by two-photon imaging. The enhanced Ca2+ levels inhibited an axonal KV7/M current, decreasing the spike threshold. In support, immunohistochemistry revealed muscarinic M1 receptor, CaV3.2, and KV7.2/7.3 subunit localization in granule cell axons. Since alterations in axonal signaling affect neuronal firing patterns and neurotransmitter release, this is an unreported cellular mechanism by which acetylcholine might, at least partly, enhance cognitive processing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acetylcholine", "Action Potentials", "Animals", "Axons", "Calcium", "Calcium Channels, T-Type", "Cholinergic Fibers", "Dentate Gyrus", "Hippocampus", "KCNQ2 Potassium Channel", "KCNQ3 Potassium Channel", "Mice", "Mossy Fibers, Hippocampal", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Neurons", "Neurons, Afferent", "Potassium", "Receptor, Muscarinic M1", "Receptors, Muscarinic", "Synaptic Potentials", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921435641", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"16039973800": {"Name": "Martinello K.", "AuthorID": "16039973800", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35076156700": {"Name": "Huang Z.", "AuthorID": "35076156700", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7402047550": {"Name": "Shah M.M.", "AuthorID": "7402047550", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7005199225": {"Name": "Lujan R.", "AuthorID": "7005199225", "AffiliationID": "60000823", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Ciencias Medicas, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha"}, "56057604600": {"Name": "Tran B.", "AuthorID": "56057604600", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Neurology and Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "7402217306": {"Name": "Cooper E.C.", "AuthorID": "7402217306", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Neurology and Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "7405486278": {"Name": "Watanabe M.", "AuthorID": "7405486278", "AffiliationID": "60171692", "AffiliationName": "Anatomy, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "35548569800": {"Name": "Brown D.A.", "AuthorID": "35548569800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
