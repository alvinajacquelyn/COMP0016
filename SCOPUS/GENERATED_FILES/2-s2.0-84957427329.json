All rights reserved.Among an inner London UK cohort of 147 adolescents transitioning from paediatric into adult care between 2007 and 2015, a new diagnosis of lymphoma was made in five patients; incidence rate = 0.425/100 person-years (95% confidence interval = 0.424-0.426). Previously described risk factors, including low nadir CD4 + cell count and ongoing HIV-1 viraemia, appeared to be important. These data suggest that careful surveillance and a low threshold for investigating relevant symptoms continue to be essential for such patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "London", "Lymphoma", "Male", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Viral Load", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957427329", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56950511600": {"Name": "Eades C.P.", "AuthorID": "56950511600", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health, Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55197247100": {"Name": "Herbert S.A.", "AuthorID": "55197247100", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health, Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56601072600": {"Name": "Edwards S.G.", "AuthorID": "56601072600", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health, Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "10140967500": {"Name": "Waters L.J.", "AuthorID": "10140967500", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health, Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24332782900": {"Name": "Peake T.", "AuthorID": "24332782900", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health, Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55547118657": {"Name": "Miller R.F.", "AuthorID": "55547118657", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sexual Health and HIV Research, Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "24787383900": {"Name": "Jungmann E.", "AuthorID": "24787383900", "AffiliationID": "60162114, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sexual Health, Mortimer Market Centre, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
