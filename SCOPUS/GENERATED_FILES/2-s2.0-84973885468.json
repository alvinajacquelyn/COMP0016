The retention of mutant protein causes hepatic damage and cirrhosis whilst the lack of an important circulating protease inhibitor predisposes the individuals with severe \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency to early onset emphysema. Our work over the past 25 years has led to new paradigms for the liver and lung disease associated with \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency. We review here the molecular pathology of the cirrhosis and emphysema associated with \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency and show how an understanding of this condition provided the paradigm for a wider group of disorders that we have termed the serpinopathies. The detailed understanding of the pathobiology of \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency has identified important disease mechanisms to target. As a result, several novel parallel and complementary therapeutic approaches are in development with some now in clinical trials. We provide an overview of these new therapies for the liver and lung disease associated with \u03b11-antitrypsin deficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cirrhosis", "Emphysema", "Polymerisation", "Serpins", "Therapeutic strategies"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha 1-Antitrypsin", "alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency", "Animals", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973885468", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, UCL/Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57201513306": {"Name": "Hurst J.R.", "AuthorID": "57201513306", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "The London Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Service, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6506674023": {"Name": "Gooptu B.", "AuthorID": "6506674023", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, King's College London, Guy's Hospital"}}}
