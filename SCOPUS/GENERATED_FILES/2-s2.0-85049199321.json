Aim: The aim of this study was to describe the roles and responsibilities of specialist and advanced practice nurses in providing care for patients with NSTEMI. Methods: Secondary analysis of observational field notes and interviews from an ethnographic study of variation in care for NSTEMI patients in 10 UK hospitals conducted 2011-2012. Data were thematically analysed to identify key concepts and themes related to the roles of specialist nurses. Results: Seven of 10 hospitals had roles for specialist nurses in NSTEMI care. The major theme related to high demand and the complexity of patients and organizations (\u2018Aligning the planets\u2019). In this theme, nurses contributed to improving services or compensating for deficiencies (\u2018Making the system work versus making up for the system\u2019). Data collection for audit could take precedence over time with patients (\u2018Paying worship to the paper\u2019). Nurses expressed a sense of ownership of cardiovascular patients that drove their desire to provide quality of care (\u2018They are our patients\u2019).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Advanced practice", "Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction", "Nursing roles", "Specialist nurses", "Variation in care"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049199321", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"57204081024": {"Name": "Deaton C.", "AuthorID": "57204081024", "AffiliationID": "60025649", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7407015732": {"Name": "Johnson R.", "AuthorID": "7407015732", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "55626487500": {"Name": "Evans M.", "AuthorID": "55626487500", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "55749172200": {"Name": "Feder G.", "AuthorID": "55749172200", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "16641919200": {"Name": "Cramer H.", "AuthorID": "16641919200", "AffiliationID": "60171764", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Academic Primary Care, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "7006508725": {"Name": "Timmis A.", "AuthorID": "7006508725", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60011243", "AffiliationName": "Barts NIHR Biomedical Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London, London Chest Hospital"}, "57212883933": {"Name": "Zaman J.", "AuthorID": "57212883933", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of East Anglia"}, "7004642497": {"Name": "Hemingway H.", "AuthorID": "7004642497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Clinical Epidemiology Group, University College London"}, "57202741470": {"Name": "Hughes J.", "AuthorID": "57202741470", "AffiliationID": "60103682", "AffiliationName": "School of Healthcare Sciences, Cardiff Metropolitan University"}}}
