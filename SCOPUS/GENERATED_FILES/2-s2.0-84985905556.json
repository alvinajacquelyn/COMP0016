Characterising neuropathology in mouse models of HD is commonly restricted to cross-sectional ex vivo analyses, beset by tissue fixation issues. In vivo longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows for disease progression to be probed non-invasively. In the HdhQ150 mouse model of HD, in vivo MRI was employed at two time points, before and after the onset of motor signs, to assess brain macrostructure and white matter microstructure. Ex vivo MRI, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscopy and behavioural testing were also conducted. Global brain atrophy was found in HdhQ150 mice at both time points, with no neuropathological progression across time and a selective sparing of the cerebellum. In contrast, no white matter abnormalities were detected from the MRI images or electron microscopy images alike. The relationship between motor function and MR-based structural measurements was different for the HdhQ150 and wild-type mice, although there was no relationship between motor deficits and histopathology. Widespread neuropathology prior to symptom onset is consistent with patient studies, whereas the absence of white matter abnormalities conflicts with patient data. The myriad reasons for this inconsistency require further attention to improve the translatability from mouse models of disease.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Atrophy", "Body Weight", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Nuclear Proteins", "Psychomotor Disorders", "Psychomotor Performance", "Species Specificity", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985905556", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55511506200": {"Name": "Steventon J.J.", "AuthorID": "55511506200", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Experimental MRI Centre, School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "16935234900": {"Name": "Jones D.K.", "AuthorID": "16935234900", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, Cardiff University, Hadyn Ellis Building"}, "8595668900": {"Name": "Trueman R.C.", "AuthorID": "8595668900", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60030816", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham University"}, "56801894700": {"Name": "Yhnell E.", "AuthorID": "56801894700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, Cardiff University, Hadyn Ellis Building"}, "36936119900": {"Name": "Bayram-Weston Z.", "AuthorID": "36936119900", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, Cardiff University, Hadyn Ellis Building"}, "16033723300": {"Name": "Rosser A.E.", "AuthorID": "16033723300", "AffiliationID": "60103683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychological Medicine and Neurology, School of Medicine, Hadyn Ellis Building"}, "55458038000": {"Name": "Stewart A.", "AuthorID": "55458038000", "AffiliationID": "60170432, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Experimental MRI Centre, School of Biosciences, Cardiff University"}, "55992234300": {"Name": "Ma D.", "AuthorID": "55992234300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging Computing, University College London"}, "57020851700": {"Name": "Cardoso J.", "AuthorID": "57020851700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging Computing, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging Computing, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
