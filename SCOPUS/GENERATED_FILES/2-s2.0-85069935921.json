Following the initiation of differentiation, OPs give rise to immature, premyelinating OLs, which undergo further differentiation and mature into myelin-forming OLs. We identified an immature OL-specific long noncoding RNA, named Pcdh17it. Through co-localization analysis and morphological characterization of OLs, we found that Pcdh17it is a specific marker for newly born immature OLs in the developing and adult forebrain of mice, and we used this new marker to analyze OL generation over the lifespan of mice. Pcdh17it is an effective tool for monitoring newly born OLs in adult brain, allowing detailed study of the dynamics of OP differentiation into OLs in the normal and pathological CNS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["immature oligodendrocyte", "long noncoding RNA", "oligodendrocyte", "oligodendrocyte dynamics", "Pcdh17it", "premyelinating oligodendrocyte"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cell Differentiation", "Central Nervous System", "Mice, Transgenic", "Myelin Sheath", "Oligodendroglia", "RNA, Long Noncoding", "Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069935921", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57210212030": {"Name": "Kasuga Y.", "AuthorID": "57210212030", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo"}, "57188707265": {"Name": "Fudge A.D.", "AuthorID": "57188707265", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "57210208525": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57210208525", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}, "14321864000": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "14321864000", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}}}
