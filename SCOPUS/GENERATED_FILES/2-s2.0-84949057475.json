Our results indicate the importance of matching carefully the affective state with appropriate feedback in order to help students transition into more positive states. For example when students were confused affect boosts and specific instruction seem to be effective in helping students to be in flow again. We discuss this and other effective ways to and implications for the development of our system and the field in general", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Affective state", "Specific instruction", "Wizard-of-oz studies"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949057475", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55930232100": {"Name": "Grawemeyer B.", "AuthorID": "55930232100", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60009016", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "6505667636": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez-Santos S.", "AuthorID": "6505667636", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60009016", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56720856800": {"Name": "Holmes W.", "AuthorID": "56720856800", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56333468200": {"Name": "Hansen A.", "AuthorID": "56333468200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University College London"}, "55762913100": {"Name": "Loibl K.", "AuthorID": "55762913100", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Educational Research, Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum"}}}
