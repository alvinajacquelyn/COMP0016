To demonstrate the potential of the approach, we consider the case of a resonance of mass MR decaying to a diphoton final state. We perform a Monte Carlo study, considering three mass points MR= 0.75 , 1.5 , 2.5 TeV, and show that the \u03b3\u03b3, WW, gg and light and heavy qq\u00af initiated cases lead to distinct predictions for the jet multiplicity distributions. As an example, we apply this result to the ATLAS search for resonances in diphoton events, using the 2015 data set of 3.2fb-1 at s=13 TeV. Taking the spin-0 selection, we demonstrate that a dominantly gg-initiated signal hypothesis is mildly disfavoured, while the \u03b3\u03b3 and light quark cases give good descriptions within the limited statistics, and a dominantly WW-initiated hypothesis is found to be in strong tension with the data. We also comment on the bb\u00af initial state, which can already be constrained by the measured b-jet multiplicity. Finally, we present expected exclusion limits with integrated luminosity, and demonstrate that with just a few 10s of fb - 1 we can expect to constrain the production modes of such a resonance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996536355", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35589760900": {"Name": "Harland-Lang L.A.", "AuthorID": "35589760900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006885662": {"Name": "Khoze V.A.", "AuthorID": "7006885662", "AffiliationID": "60014977", "AffiliationName": "Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, NRC Kurchatov Institute"}, "22951811000": {"Name": "Spannowsky M.", "AuthorID": "22951811000", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176038", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, Durham University"}, "7005386952": {"Name": "Ryskin M.G.", "AuthorID": "7005386952", "AffiliationID": "60014977", "AffiliationName": "Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, NRC Kurchatov Institute"}}}
