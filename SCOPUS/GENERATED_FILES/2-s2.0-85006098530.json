Methods Retrospective analysis of medical and chemotherapy records of consecutive patients with OC between 2005 and 2013 at UCL Hospitals London, UK who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was then found to be unsuitable for IDS following review by the multidisciplinary team. Results Eighty-three patients (18%) out of 467 receiving NACT did not undergo IDS. Median age was 70 years (range 33\u201388); out of these 83 patients, 43 (51.8%) presented with stage IV disease. Forty-three of these 83 patients received carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP) (51.8%) and 37 received carboplatin alone (C) (44.6%); 3 patients (3.6%) received other platinum-based combinations. Reasons for not proceeding to surgery were: poor response to chemotherapy after 3\u20134 cycles of NACT (61/83, 73.5%); comorbidities (12/83, 14.5%); patient decision (4/83, 4.8%). Six patients (7.2%) received < 3 cycles of NACT due to a worsening clinical condition. The median overall survival (OS) for patients not undergoing IDS was 18 months (95% CI 10\u201320 months). Forty-four of 83 patients (53%) received > 2 lines of chemotherapy. In a univariate analysis CP, age < 70 years, and absence of comorbidities were factors influencing OS. In a multivariate analysis only having received CP remained independently associated with OS (HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29\u20130.84). Conclusions Chemotherapy alone can provide reasonable disease control in patients unsuitable for IDS and CP should be used if possible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Advanced ovarian cancer", "Carboplatin", "Chemotherapy", "Debulking", "Neoadjuvant", "Paclitaxel", "Surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Carboplatin", "Comorbidity", "Female", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Neoplasm Staging", "Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Paclitaxel", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006098530", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"16242013300": {"Name": "Marchetti C.", "AuthorID": "16242013300", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecological and Obstetrical Sciences and Urological Sciences, University \u201cSapienza\u201d"}, "8771515300": {"Name": "Kristeleit R.", "AuthorID": "8771515300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute and UCL Hospitals"}, "7007134127": {"Name": "Ledermann J.A.", "AuthorID": "7007134127", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute and UCL Hospitals"}, "36025654200": {"Name": "McCormack M.", "AuthorID": "36025654200", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Division, University College Hospital, UCL Hospitals"}, "6601965754": {"Name": "Mould T.", "AuthorID": "6601965754", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Women's Health University College Hospital, UCL Hospitals"}, "35596293800": {"Name": "Olaitan A.", "AuthorID": "35596293800", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Women's Health University College Hospital, UCL Hospitals"}, "7006520678": {"Name": "Widschwendter M.", "AuthorID": "7006520678", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Women's Health University College Hospital, UCL Hospitals"}, "8621989000": {"Name": "MacDonald N.", "AuthorID": "8621989000", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Women's Health University College Hospital, UCL Hospitals"}}}
