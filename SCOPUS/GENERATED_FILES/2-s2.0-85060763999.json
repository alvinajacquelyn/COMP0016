Methods: Contemporary literature was analyzed for the latest evidence in treatment options, outcomes, including radical surgery, neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment modalities, and bladder-sparing approaches. An international multi-disciplinary expert panel evaluated and graded the data according to guidelines from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Results: Radical cystectomy (RC) is the standard of care for MIBC patients considered to be surgical candidates. While associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, this has been mitigated with improved technique, minimally invasive technology, and better perioperative care pathways (e.g., enhanced recovery after surgery). Neoadjuvant (NA) cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy improves overall survival and should be offered to eligible \u2265 cT2N0 patients. Adjuvant (Adj) cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy may be considered, particularly for pT3\u20134 and/or pN+ disease without prior NA chemotherapy. Trimodal bladder-preserving treatment via maximum transurethral resection of bladder tumor followed by concurrent chemoradiation is safe and, when combined with early salvage RC for recurrence, offers long-term survival rates in selected patients comparable to RC. Immunotherapy is still experimental and is given either alone or in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiation. Conclusion: A multi-disciplinary approach is paramount to achieving optimal outcomes for MIBC patients, irrespective of their age, performance and nutritional status, fitness/frailty, renal and other organ function, or disease severity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adjuvant chemotherapy", "Bladder-sparing", "Chemoradiation", "Enhanced recovery after surgery", "Muscle-invasive bladder cancer", "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy", "Radical cystectomy", "Transurethral resection of bladder tumor", "Trimodal", "Urothelial carcinoma of bladder", "Variant histology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combined Modality Therapy", "Consensus", "Cystectomy", "Humans", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Societies, Medical", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060763999", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"36573813800": {"Name": "Leow J.J.", "AuthorID": "36573813800", "AffiliationID": "60002481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Tan Tock Seng Hospital"}, "23970330900": {"Name": "Bedke J.", "AuthorID": "23970330900", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "7005619547": {"Name": "Stenzl A.", "AuthorID": "7005619547", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "23567881000": {"Name": "Chamie K.", "AuthorID": "23567881000", "AffiliationID": "60005247", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology and Institute of Urologic Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California"}, "7404950765": {"Name": "Collins J.W.", "AuthorID": "7404950765", "AffiliationID": "117919155", "AffiliationName": "Orsi Academy"}, "7003844905": {"Name": "Daneshmand S.", "AuthorID": "7003844905", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "USC Institute of Urology, University of Southern California"}, "14421133200": {"Name": "Grivas P.", "AuthorID": "14421133200", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington"}, "7102024413": {"Name": "Heidenreich A.", "AuthorID": "7102024413", "AffiliationID": "60008658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University Hospital of Cologne"}, "7006379767": {"Name": "Messing E.M.", "AuthorID": "7006379767", "AffiliationID": "60012831, 60024746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57193628187": {"Name": "Royce T.J.", "AuthorID": "57193628187", "AffiliationID": "60020469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine"}, "25652016000": {"Name": "Sankin A.I.", "AuthorID": "25652016000", "AffiliationID": "60002388, 60024099", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "7101972600": {"Name": "Schoenberg M.P.", "AuthorID": "7101972600", "AffiliationID": "60002388, 60024099", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "35391864300": {"Name": "Shipley W.U.", "AuthorID": "35391864300", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Genitourinary Division, Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "19234005300": {"Name": "Efstathiou J.A.", "AuthorID": "19234005300", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Genitourinary Division, Department of Radiation Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7005694427": {"Name": "Villers A.", "AuthorID": "7005694427", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of Lille Nord de France"}, "7006039771": {"Name": "Bellmunt J.", "AuthorID": "7006039771", "AffiliationID": "60023506, 60000100", "AffiliationName": "PSMAR-IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute"}}}
