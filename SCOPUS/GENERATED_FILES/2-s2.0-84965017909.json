We investigated whether this risk extends to adults in England. Methods: Six adult sleep centers in England were visited between November 2012 and February 2014 and vaccination/clinical histories obtained from general practitioners. Suspected narcolepsy cases aged older than 17 y were selected. The risk of narcolepsy following Pandemrix was calculated using cases diagnosed by the time of the center visits and those with a diagnosis by November 30, 2011 after which there was increased awareness of the risk in children. The odds of vaccination in cases and in matched population data were compared using a case-coverage design. Results: Of 1,446 possible cases identified, most had onset before 2009 or were clearly not narcolepsy. Of the 60 remaining cases, 20 were excluded after expert review, leaving 40 cases with narcolepsy; 5 had received Pandemrix between 3 and 18 mo before onset. All the vaccinated cases had cataplexy, two received a diagnosis by November 2011 and two were aged 40 y or older. The odds ratio for vaccination in cases compared to the population was 4.24 (95% confidence interval 1.45 12.38) using all cases and 9.06 (1.90 43.17) using cases with a diagnosis by November 2011, giving an attributable risk of 0.59 cases per 100,000 doses. Conclusions: We found a significantly increased risk of narcolepsy in adults following Pandemrix vaccination in England. The risk was lower than that seen in children using a similar study design.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-coverage", "Narcolepsy", "Pandemrix", "Vaccination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adjuvants, Immunologic", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cataplexy", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype", "Influenza Vaccines", "Influenza, Human", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Narcolepsy", "Odds Ratio", "Pandemics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Research Design", "Risk Assessment", "Sleep", "Vaccination", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965017909", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"7007077594": {"Name": "Stowe J.", "AuthorID": "7007077594", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "7103346572": {"Name": "Andrews N.", "AuthorID": "7103346572", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "7404491797": {"Name": "Miller E.", "AuthorID": "7404491797", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Public Health England"}, "55275316800": {"Name": "Kosky C.", "AuthorID": "55275316800", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Guy s and St Thomas NHS Trust"}, "57196451336": {"Name": "Dennis G.", "AuthorID": "57196451336", "AffiliationID": "60006444", "AffiliationName": "Royal Hallamshire Hospital"}, "57210401089": {"Name": "Eriksson S.", "AuthorID": "57210401089", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "14422162700": {"Name": "Hall A.", "AuthorID": "14422162700", "AffiliationID": "60028485", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care and Sleep Disorders Medicine, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "13807606900": {"Name": "Leschziner G.", "AuthorID": "13807606900", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Consultant Neurologist/Clinical Lead Sleep, Guy s and St Thomas NHS Trust"}, "17535045800": {"Name": "Reading P.", "AuthorID": "17535045800", "AffiliationID": "60014315", "AffiliationName": "Consultant Neurologist, South Tees NHS Trust"}, "7005999726": {"Name": "Shneerson J.M.", "AuthorID": "7005999726", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Papworth Hospital NHS Foundation"}, "57189067817": {"Name": "Donegan K.", "AuthorID": "57189067817", "AffiliationID": "60025465", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacoepidemiology Research and Intelligence Unit, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency"}}}
