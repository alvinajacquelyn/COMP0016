We show that the seller-optimal mechanism takes the same form as in the case when there is commitment: The seller maximizes revenue by assigning, at t=. 1, the good to the buyer with the highest virtual valuation if it is above a buyer-specific reserve price. If no trade takes place at t=. 1, at t=. 2, the seller assigns the object to the buyer with the highest posterior virtual valuation, provided that it is above the seller's value.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Limited commitment", "Mechanism design", "Optimal auctions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928911441", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"13402878100": {"Name": "Skreta V.", "AuthorID": "13402878100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Economics"}}}
