In a unique experiment, we tested the effects of these bodily metaphors using biofeedback and an incentivized economic decision-making paradigm. Participants played a repeated investment game with a simulated partner, alternating between tactical investor and altruistic investee. When making decisions, participants received counterbalanced visual feedback from their own or a simulated partner\u2019s heart or head, as well as no feedback. As investor, participants transferred a greater proportion of their endowments when exposed to visual feedback from their own head than to feedback from their own heart or no feedback at all. These effects were not observed when the source of the feedback was the simulated partner. As investee, heart feedback predicted greater altruistic returns than head or no feedback, but this effect did not differ based on source (own vs partner). Consistent with a dual-process framework, we suggest that people may be encouraged to invest more or be more altruistic when receiving bodily feedback from conceptually diametric sources.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Altruism", "Biofeedback", "Decision-making", "Economic game", "Embodied metaphor", "Investment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Altruism", "Awareness", "Decision Making", "Economics, Behavioral", "Electroencephalography", "Empathy", "Feedback", "Female", "Games, Experimental", "Head", "Heart", "Humans", "Male", "Photoplethysmography", "Self Report", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055593660", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55598199600": {"Name": "Powell P.", "AuthorID": "55598199600", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Institute for Economic Analysis of Decision-Making (InstEAD), University of Sheffield"}, "56925838100": {"Name": "Roberts J.", "AuthorID": "56925838100", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, Institute for Economic Analysis of Decision-Making (InstEAD), University of Sheffield"}, "57201315991": {"Name": "Puustinen-Hopper K.", "AuthorID": "57201315991", "AffiliationID": "120437490", "AffiliationName": "Impossible Labs"}, "53263340900": {"Name": "de Jode M.", "AuthorID": "53263340900", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Information Systems, University of Greenwich"}, "55617109300": {"Name": "Mavros P.", "AuthorID": "55617109300", "AffiliationID": "60115718", "AffiliationName": "Future Cities Laboratory, Singapore-ETH Centre"}}}
