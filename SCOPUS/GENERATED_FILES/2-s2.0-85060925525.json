With no curative treatment available and a risk of potentially severe complications and death, it is likely that those diagnosed with the illness may experience impairments in their psychological wellbeing. The aim of this scoping review is to locate, chart, and summarize all available literature on how PSC affects mental health and psychological wellbeing, as well as the factors that may or may not impact on the psychological wellbeing of those who have this diagnosis. This exercise identified five key themes within the literature: prevalence and characteristics of mental health problems, quality of life, unmet needs, medical treatment, and biomarkers. Three key recommendations for clinical practice emerge from this review.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mental health", "primary sclerosing cholangitis", "psychological wellbeing", "scoping review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cholangitis, Sclerosing", "Humans", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060925525", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"56008635900": {"Name": "Ranieri V.", "AuthorID": "56008635900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science and Technology Studies, University College London"}, "55360599000": {"Name": "McKay K.", "AuthorID": "55360599000", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, Health and Society, Waterhouse Building, University of Liverpool"}, "9633478100": {"Name": "Senior R.", "AuthorID": "9633478100", "AffiliationID": "60020150", "AffiliationName": "Research and Development Unit, Tavistock Centre, Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16030968700": {"Name": "Kennedy E.", "AuthorID": "16030968700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56517830900": {"Name": "Walmsley M.", "AuthorID": "56517830900", "AffiliationID": "114993747", "AffiliationName": "PSC Support"}, "55217322300": {"Name": "Thorburn D.", "AuthorID": "55217322300", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, UCL Institute of Liver and Digestive Health, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
