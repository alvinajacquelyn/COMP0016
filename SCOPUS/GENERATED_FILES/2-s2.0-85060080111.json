We show that radial mixing drives a positive vertical metallicity gradient in the mono-age disk population whose initial scale-height is constant and initial radial metallicity gradient is tight and negative. On the other hand, if the initial disk is flaring, with scale-height increasing with galactocentric radius, radial mixing leads to a negative vertical metallicity gradient, which is consistent with the current observed trend. We also discuss impacts of radial mixing on the metallicity distribution of the thick disk stars. By matching the metallicity distribution of N-body models to the SDSS/APOGEE data, we argue that the progenitor of the Milky Way's thick disk should not have a steep negative metallicity gradient.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxy: abundances", "Galaxy: disk", "Galaxy: evolution", "Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics", "methods: n-body simulations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060080111", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57203073684": {"Name": "Kawata D.", "AuthorID": "57203073684", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
