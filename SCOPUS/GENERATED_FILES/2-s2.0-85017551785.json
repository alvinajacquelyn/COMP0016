Methods: Two EEG experts annotated bursts in individual EEG channels for 36 preterm infants with gestational age < 30 weeks. The feature set included spectral, amplitude, and frequency-weighted energy features. Using a consensus annotation, feature selection removed redundant features and a support vector machine combined features. Area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC) and Cohen's kappa (\u03ba) evaluated performance within a cross-validation procedure. Results: The proposed channel-independent method improves AUC by 4\u20135% over existing methods (p < 0.001, n=36), with median (95% confidence interval) AUC of 0.989 (0.973\u20130.997) and sensitivity\u2013specificity of 95.8\u201394.4%. Agreement rates between the detector and experts\u2019 annotations, \u03ba=0.72 (0.36\u20130.83) and \u03ba=0.65 (0.32\u20130.81), are comparable to inter-rater agreement, \u03ba=0.60 (0.21\u20130.74). Conclusions: Automating the visual identification of bursts in preterm EEG is achievable with a high level of accuracy. Multiple features, combined using a data-driven approach, improves on existing single-feature methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burst detection", "Electroencephalography", "Feature extraction", "Inter-burst interval", "Preterm infant", "Spectral analysis", "Support vector machine"], "IndexKeywords": ["Burst detection", "Channel independent", "Data-driven approach", "Inter-burst interval", "Inter-rater agreements", "Preterm infants", "Receiver operator characteristics", "Visual identification", "Electroencephalography", "Humans", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017551785", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"15923829700": {"Name": "O'Toole J.", "AuthorID": "15923829700", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "6602292136": {"Name": "Boylan G.", "AuthorID": "6602292136", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "56454804400": {"Name": "Lloyd R.", "AuthorID": "56454804400", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "56454959800": {"Name": "Goulding R.", "AuthorID": "56454959800", "AffiliationID": "60113732, 60025160", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Brain Research Group, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research (INFANT), University College Cork"}, "15924307900": {"Name": "Stevenson N.", "AuthorID": "15924307900", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "BaBa Centre, University of Helsinki"}, "7005870452": {"Name": "Vanhatalo S.", "AuthorID": "7005870452", "AffiliationID": "60000113, 60016987, 60020970, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Children's Hospital, HUS Medical Imaging Center, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital"}}}
