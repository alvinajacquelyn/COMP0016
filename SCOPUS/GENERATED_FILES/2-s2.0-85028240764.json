Exploring the view of parents of a child with language impairment (LI) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is particularly important because of their high prevalence, at over 30% of children with SEN in England, and the increasing evidence of overlapping profiles of their needs. Aims: To examine the similarities and differences between the perspectives of parents of children with LI or ASD on three issues: (1) their child's educational progress, and their behavioural, emotional and social development; (2) the provision made to support their child's education and meet their SEN; and (3) their own involvement in decision-making about provision for their child. Methods & Procedures: The parents of 129 children with LI (n = 76) or ASD (n = 53) were interviewed using a semi-structured protocol that gathered both quantitative data (parent ratings) and qualitative, in-depth explorations of their perspectives. Outcomes & Results: There were no significant differences between the perspectives of parents of children with LI and parents of children with ASD with respect to their child's educational progress; the provision made to meet their child's educational needs; or their involvement in decision-making during the statutory assessment procedure, including the determination of a statement of SEN, and the current provision made by their child's school. Both parent groups were generally positive about these but parents of children with ASD were more concerned about their child's peer relationships. Parents whose child attended a mainstream school with a specialist resource tended to be more positive about the provision made than parents whose child was included individually into a mainstream school. Conclusions & Implications: Although previous research indicates that parents of children with ASD are overrepresented among those who express dissatisfaction with the provision made to meet their child's needs, this study indicates high levels of satisfaction and overlap between the perspectives of parents of children with LI or ASD regarding their child's educational progress and their own involvement in decision-making about the child's provision. The findings indicate the importance for policy and practice of focusing on identified needs rather than diagnostic category; and the importance of practitioners and administrators engaging meaningfully with parents in collaborative decision-making.", "AuthorKeywords": ["autism spectrum disorders (ASD)", "education", "language impairment", "parents", "schoolage children"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028240764", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"7102841300": {"Name": "Lindsay G.", "AuthorID": "7102841300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "CEDAR, University of Warwick"}, "57195458410": {"Name": "Peacey L.V.", "AuthorID": "57195458410", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "CEDAR, University of Warwick"}, "18038318500": {"Name": "Ricketts J.", "AuthorID": "18038318500", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "7004429681": {"Name": "Dockrell J.E.", "AuthorID": "7004429681", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "University of London, Psychology and Human Development, Institute of Education"}, "7006913774": {"Name": "Charman T.", "AuthorID": "7006913774", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry"}}}
