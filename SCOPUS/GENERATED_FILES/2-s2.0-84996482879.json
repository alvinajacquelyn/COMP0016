Computed tomography (CT) has been the modality of choice for RTP as it easily provides electron density information. However,its low soft tissue contrast limits the accuracy of organ delineation. On the contrary,magnetic resonance (MR) provides images with excellent soft tissue contrast but its use for RTP is limited by the fact that it does not readily provide tissue attenuation information. In this work we propose a multi-atlas information propagation scheme that jointly segments the organs at risk and generates pseudo CT data from MR images. We demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to automatically generate accurate pseudo CT images and segmentations in the pelvic region,bypassing the need for CT scan for accurate RTP.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CT Image", "Information propagation", "Joint segmentation", "MR images", "Organs at risks", "Radiotherapy treatment planning", "Soft tissue", "Tissue attenuation"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996482879", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"55887379000": {"Name": "Burgos N.", "AuthorID": "55887379000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}, "57015403200": {"Name": "Guerreiro F.", "AuthorID": "57015403200", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (ICR/RMH)"}, "55887467300": {"Name": "Nill S.", "AuthorID": "55887467300", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (ICR/RMH)"}, "6701862795": {"Name": "Oelfke U.", "AuthorID": "6701862795", "AffiliationID": "60017166, 60010337", "AffiliationName": "Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust (ICR/RMH)"}, "8757124700": {"Name": "McClelland J.", "AuthorID": "8757124700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7004428943": {"Name": "Dearnaley D.", "AuthorID": "7004428943", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Academic Urology Unit, ICR/RMH"}, "7004981356": {"Name": "Desouza N.", "AuthorID": "7004981356", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Centre for Cancer Imaging, ICR/RMH"}, "6602341416": {"Name": "Knopf A.C.", "AuthorID": "6602341416", "AffiliationID": "60006027, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen"}}}
