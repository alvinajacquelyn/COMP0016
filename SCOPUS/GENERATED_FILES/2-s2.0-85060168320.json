The fraction of the jet transverse momentum pT,jet carried by the J/\u03c8 is measured for prompt J/\u03c8 and J/\u03c8 coming from b hadron decays, named nonprompt. Whereas the fragmentation function of nonprompt J/\u03c8 is well-modeled by simulations using a Monte Carlo generator, the prompt J/\u03c8 are found to be accompanied by a larger level of jet activity. The fraction of J/\u03c8 mesons that are produced inside a jet is also reported, and found to be larger in data than in simulation, for both prompt and nonprompt J/\u03c8.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CMS", "J/\u03c8", "Jets", "pp collisions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060168320", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"56596681500": {"Name": "Diab B.", "AuthorID": "56596681500", "AffiliationID": "60105986, 60013425", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Leprince-Ringuet, \u00c9cole polytechnique"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
