Here a metagenomics mining strategy has been used for new transaminase enzyme discovery. Starting from oral cavity microbiome samples, DNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were performed. Subsequent in silico mining of a library of contiguous reads built from the sequencing data identified 11 putative Class III transaminases which were cloned and overexpressed. Several screening protocols were used and three enzymes selected of interest due to activities towards substrates covering a wide structural diversity. Transamination of functionalized cinnamaldehydes was then investigated for the production of valuable amine building blocks.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027000098", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"56979143000": {"Name": "Baud D.", "AuthorID": "56979143000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.C.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, UCL"}, "57195315874": {"Name": "Jeffries J.W.E.", "AuthorID": "57195315874", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, UCL Bernard Katz Building"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.M.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemical Engineering, UCL Bernard Katz Building"}, "7103123274": {"Name": "Moody T.S.", "AuthorID": "7103123274", "AffiliationID": "119050628", "AffiliationName": "Almac, Department of Biocatalysis and Isotope Chemistry"}}}
