All rights reserved.Background: Most pediatric lipodystrophy data come from high-income/middle-income countries, but most HIV-infected children live in sub-Saharan Africa, where lipodystrophy studies have predominantly investigated stavudine-based regimens. Methods: Three years after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses were measured (n = 590), and fasted lipid profile assayed (n = 325), in children from 2 ARROW trial centres in Uganda/Zimbabwe. Analyses compared randomization to long-term versus short-term versus no zidovudine from ART initiation [unadjusted; latter 2 groups receiving abacavir+lamivudine+non-nucleoside-reverse-transciptase-inhibitor (nNRTI) long-term], and nonrandomized (confounder-adjusted) receipt of nevirapine versus efavirenz. Results: Body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses were similar regardless of zidovudine exposure (P > 0.1), except for subscapular and supra-iliac skinfolds-for-age which were greater with long-term zidovudine (0.006 <P < 0.047). Circumferences/skinfolds were also similar with efavirenz and nevirapine (adjusted P > 0.09; 0.02 < P < 0.03 for waist/waist-hip-ratio). Total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, HDL/triglycerideratio (P < 0.0001) and triglycerides (P = 0.01) were lower with long-term zidovudine. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was higher with efavirenz than nevirapine (P < 0.001). Most lipids remained within normal ranges (75% cholesterol, 85% LDL and 100% triglycerides) but more on long-term zidovudine (3 NRTI) had abnormal HDL-cholesterol (88% vs. 40% short/no-zidovudine, P < 0.0001). Only 8/579(1.4%) children had clinical fat wasting (5 grade 1; 3 grade 2); 2(0.3%) had grade 1 fat accumulation. Conclusions: Long-term zidovudine-based ART is associated with similar body circumferences and skinfold thicknesses to abacavir-based ART, with low rates of lipid abnormalities and clinical lipodystrophy, providing reassurance where national programs now recommend long-term zidovudine. Efavirenz and nevirapine were also similar; however, the higher LDL observed with efavirenz and lower HDL observed with zidovudine suggests that zidovudine+lamivudine+efavirenz should be investigated in future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Antiretroviral therapy", "Children", "HIV", "Lipids", "Lipodystrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "Body Fat Distribution", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant", "Lipids", "Lipodystrophy", "Male", "Prevalence", "Uganda", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925640301", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"36554025300": {"Name": "Bwakura-Dangarembizi M.", "AuthorID": "36554025300", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Sciences"}, "35571060200": {"Name": "Gomo Z.A.", "AuthorID": "35571060200", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Sciences"}, "8308777100": {"Name": "Musarurwa C.", "AuthorID": "8308777100", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Sciences"}, "57210663714": {"Name": "Nathoo K.", "AuthorID": "57210663714", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe, College of Health Sciences"}, "17135681200": {"Name": "Musiime V.", "AuthorID": "17135681200", "AffiliationID": "60071676", "AffiliationName": "Makerere University, College of Health Sciences"}, "6603691631": {"Name": "Mugyenyi P.", "AuthorID": "6603691631", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre (JCRC)"}, "24777020100": {"Name": "Szubert A.J.", "AuthorID": "24777020100", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}, "15760719100": {"Name": "Prendergast A.J.", "AuthorID": "15760719100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Paediatrics, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "9735572400": {"Name": "Thomason M.J.", "AuthorID": "9735572400", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}, "35402208300": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "35402208300", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}, "36439791400": {"Name": "Nahirya P.", "AuthorID": "36439791400", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Uganda Virus Research Institute, Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "21934132800": {"Name": "Kekitiinwa A.", "AuthorID": "21934132800", "AffiliationID": "60071696", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Infectious Diseases Clinic/Baylor - Uganda, Mulago Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
