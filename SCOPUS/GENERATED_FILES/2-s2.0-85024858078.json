(NS) seeds, known as black seed, is a spice and a traditional herbal medicine used in various diseases including bronchial asthma. This review aimed to assess the studies supporting the medicinal use of NS in asthma and to highlight future research priorities. Various medical databases were searched for the effects of NS and its active secondary metabolites in asthma inflammation and outcomes. There were fourteen preclinical studies describing multiple effects of NS in animal or cellular models of asthma including bronchodilation, anti-histaminic, anti-inflammatory, anti-leukotrienes and immunomodulatory effects. Furthermore, seven clinical studies showed improvements in different asthma outcomes including symptoms, pulmonary function and laboratory parameters. However, often these studies are small and used ill-defined preparations. In conclusion, NS could be therapeutically beneficial in alleviating airway inflammation and the control of asthma symptoms, but the evidence remains scanty and is often based on poorly characterised preparations. Accordingly, well-designed large clinical studies using chemically well characterised NS preparation are required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asthma", "Black seed", "Clinical studies", "Nigella sativa", "Traditional medicine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024858078", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57193498244": {"Name": "Koshak A.", "AuthorID": "57193498244", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Department of Natural Products & Alternative Medicine, Faculty of Pharmacy, King Abdulaziz University"}, "16156235300": {"Name": "Heinrich M.", "AuthorID": "16156235300", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Cluster Biodiversity and Medicines, UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56626477500": {"Name": "Koshak E.", "AuthorID": "56626477500", "AffiliationID": "60004582", "AffiliationName": "Allergy and Clinical Immunology Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, King Abdulaziz University"}}}
