Pathologic expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat in the C9orf72 gene has been demonstrated to cause neurodegeneration with diverse neurologic presentations. To test the hypothesis whether pathologic expansions in C9orf72 are a cause of MSA, we undertook genetic screening in 100 neuropathologically confirmed cases. No pathologic repeat expansions were detected suggesting that MSA is not a C9orf72-related neurodegenerative disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", "C9orf72", "Fronto-temporal dementia", "Multiple system atrophy", "Neurodegeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cohort Studies", "DNA Repeat Expansion", "Genetic Testing", "Humans", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922892623", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"12240193500": {"Name": "Scholz S.W.", "AuthorID": "12240193500", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "6507635948": {"Name": "Majounie E.", "AuthorID": "6507635948", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "7006092717": {"Name": "Singleton A.B.", "AuthorID": "7006092717", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health"}, "7102381695": {"Name": "Revesz T.", "AuthorID": "7102381695", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Reta Lila Weston Laboratories, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7101772051": {"Name": "Holton J.L.", "AuthorID": "7101772051", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Reta Lila Weston Laboratories, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Reta Lila Weston Laboratories, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203086773": {"Name": "Okun M.S.", "AuthorID": "57203086773", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "UF Center for Movement Disorders and Neurorestoration, McKnight Brain Institute, Department of Neurology"}}}
