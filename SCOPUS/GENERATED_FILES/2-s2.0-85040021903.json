Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. All rights reserved.Longitudinal data sources offer new opportunities for the evaluation of sequential interventions. To adjust for time-dependent confounding in these settings, longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood based estimation (TMLE), a doubly robust method that can be coupled with machine learning, has been proposed. This paper provides a tutorial in applying longitudinal TMLE, in contrast to inverse probability of treatment weighting and g-computation based on iterative conditional expectations. We apply these methods to estimate the causal effect of nutritional interventions on clinical outcomes among critically ill children in a United Kingdom study (Control of Hyperglycemia in Paediatric Intensive Care, 2008-2011). We estimate the probability of a child's being discharged alive from the pediatric intensive care unit by a given day, under a range of static and dynamic feeding regimes. We find that before adjustment, patients who follow the static regime \"never feed\" are discharged by the end of the fifth day with a probability of 0.88 (95%confidence interval: 0.87, 0.90), while for the patients who follow the regime \"feed from day 3,\" the probability of discharge is 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.66). After adjustment for time-dependent confounding, most of this difference disappears, and the statistical methods produce similar results. TMLE offers a flexible estimation approach; hence, we provide practical guidance on implementation to encourage its wider use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Causal inference", "Epidemiologic methods", "Longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation", "Machine learning", "Super Learner", "Time-dependent confounding"], "IndexKeywords": ["Comparative Effectiveness Research", "Computer Simulation", "Critical Illness", "Enteral Nutrition", "Feeding Methods", "Hospital Mortality", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Likelihood Functions", "Machine Learning", "Models, Statistical", "Parenteral Nutrition", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040021903", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"]], "AuthorData": {"26658623800": {"Name": "Kreif N.", "AuthorID": "26658623800", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Economics, University of York"}, "56231034600": {"Name": "Tran L.", "AuthorID": "56231034600", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley"}, "7202846215": {"Name": "Petersen M.", "AuthorID": "7202846215", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley"}, "56363807800": {"Name": "Grieve R.", "AuthorID": "56363807800", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Services Research and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7004622714": {"Name": "De Stavola B.", "AuthorID": "7004622714", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7102106496": {"Name": "Tasker R.", "AuthorID": "7102106496", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital"}}}
