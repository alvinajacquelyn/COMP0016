In this paper, we review the HIV Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviour component of the 2011 Ugandan Demographic and Health Survey, analysing a series of questions comparing those with and without disabilities in relation to HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudes and practices. We found comparable levels of knowledge on HIV/AIDS for those with and those without disabilities in relation to HIV transmission during delivery (93.89%, 93.26%) and through breastfeeding (89.91%, 90.63%), which may reflect increased attention to reaching the community of persons with disabilities. However, several gaps in the knowledge base of persons with disabilities stood out, including misconceptions of risk of HIV infection through mosquito bites and caring for a relative with HIV in own household (34.39%, 29.86%; p<0.001; 91.53%, 89.00%; p = 0.001, respectively). The issue is not just access to appropriate information but also equitable access to HIV/AIDS services and support. Here we found that persons with multiple disabilities were less likely than individuals without disabilities to return to receive results from their most recent HIV test (0.60[0.41\u00b10.87], p<0.05). HIV testing means little if people do not return for follow-up to know their HIV status and, if necessary, to be connected to available services and supports. Additional findings of note were that persons with disabilities reported having a first sexual encounter at a slightly younger age than peers without disabilities; and persons with disabilities also reported having a sexually transmitted disease (STD) within the last 12 months at significantly higher rates than peers without disabilities (1.38[1.18\u00b11.63], p<0.01), despite reporting comparable knowledge of the need for safer sex practices. This analysis is among the first to use HIV/AIDS-related questions from Demographic Health Surveys to provide information about persons with disabilities in Uganda in comparison to those without disabilities. These findings present a more complex and nuanced understanding of persons with disabilities and HIV/AIDS. If persons with disabilities are becoming sexually active earlier, are more likely to have an STD within the preceding 12 month period and are less likely to receive HIV test results, it is important to understand why. Recommendations are also made for the inclusion of disability measures in Uganda's AIDS Indicator Survey to provide cyclical and systematic data on disability and HIV/AIDS, including HIV prevalence amongst persons with disabilities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome", "Adolescent", "Adult", "Attitude to Health", "Humans", "Knowledge", "Middle Aged", "Patient Education as Topic", "Risk-Taking", "Uganda"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017460372", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57205012124": {"Name": "Abimanyi-Ochom J.", "AuthorID": "57205012124", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Social Development, Deakin University"}, "6603405895": {"Name": "Mannan H.", "AuthorID": "6603405895", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems, Health Sciences Centre, University College Dublin"}, "57204340273": {"Name": "Groce N.", "AuthorID": "57204340273", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "54979773500": {"Name": "McVeigh J.", "AuthorID": "54979773500", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Health, School of Psychology, Trinity College Dublin"}}}
