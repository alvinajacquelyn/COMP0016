Here, we evaluated the diagnostic and clinical value of a robust, inexpensive, immunoassay detecting the circulating soluble form of the monocyte-specific surface receptor sialic acid binding Ig-like lectin 1 (sSIGLEC-1). Methods: We developed an immunoassay to measure sSIGLEC-1 in small volumes of plasma/serum from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (n=75) and healthy donors (n=504). Samples from systemic sclerosis patients (n=99) were studied as an autoimmune control. We investigated the correlation between sSIGLEC-1 and both monocyte surface SIGLEC-1 and type I interferon-regulated gene (IRG) expression. Associations of sSIGLEC-1 with clinical features were evaluated in an independent cohort of SLE patients (n=656). Results: Plasma concentrations of sSIGLEC-1 strongly correlated with expression of SIGLEC-1 on the surface of blood monocytes and with IRG expression in SLE patients. We found ancestry-related differences in sSIGLEC-1 concentrations in SLE patients, with patients of non-European ancestry showing higher levels compared to patients of European ancestry. Higher sSIGLEC-1 concentrations were associated with lower serum complement component 3 and increased frequency of renal complications in European patients, but not with the SLE Disease Activity Index clinical score. Conclusions: Our sSIGLEC-1 immunoassay provides a specific and easily assayed marker for monocyte-macrophage activation, and interferonopathy in SLE and other diseases. Further studies can extend its clinical associations and its potential use to stratify patients and as a secondary endpoint inclinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmunity", "Biomarker", "Interferonopathy", "Soluble SIGLEC-1", "Type I interferon"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Interferon-alpha", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Lupus Nephritis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1", "Transcriptome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050638449", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57193664606": {"Name": "Oliveira J.J.", "AuthorID": "57193664606", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Medical Genetics, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "6506399243": {"Name": "Rainbow D.B.", "AuthorID": "6506399243", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "54410455100": {"Name": "Clarke P.", "AuthorID": "54410455100", "AffiliationID": "60103296, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Medical Genetics, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research"}, "56521587500": {"Name": "Rubio Garc\u00eda A.", "AuthorID": "56521587500", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7005565823": {"Name": "Wicker L.S.", "AuthorID": "7005565823", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57197088090": {"Name": "Todd J.A.", "AuthorID": "57197088090", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "35080337400": {"Name": "Ferreira R.C.", "AuthorID": "35080337400", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "6505609603": {"Name": "Karrar S.", "AuthorID": "6505609603", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine and Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease"}, "57198291900": {"Name": "Pinder C.L.", "AuthorID": "57198291900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine and Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease"}, "57203677783": {"Name": "Vyse T.J.", "AuthorID": "57203677783", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine and Division of Immunology, Infection and Inflammatory Disease"}, "13605404000": {"Name": "Al-Assar O.", "AuthorID": "13605404000", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60172675, 60099539", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, JDRF/Wellcome Diabetes and Inflammation Laboratory, Wellcome Centre for Human Genetics, Nuffield Department of Medicine, NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre"}, "15058551600": {"Name": "Burling K.", "AuthorID": "15058551600", "AffiliationID": "119692780", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory"}, "57203135305": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "57203135305", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, UCL Medical School"}, "7006263741": {"Name": "Stratton R.", "AuthorID": "7006263741", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Rheumatology and Connective Tissue Diseases, UCL Medical School"}}}
