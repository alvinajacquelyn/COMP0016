Method Five 10-min segments of icEEG recorded in 5 patients were used. WC and three expert EEG reviewers independently classified one hundred IED events into IED classes or non-IEDs. First, we determined whether WC-human agreement variability falls within inter-reviewer agreement variability by calculating the variation of information for each classifier pair and quantifying the overlap between all WC-reviewer and all reviewer-reviewer pairs. Second, we compared WC and EEG reviewers\u2019 spike identification and individual spike class labels visually and quantitatively. Results The overlap between all WC-human pairs and all human pairs was >80% for 3/5 patients and >58% for the other 2 patients demonstrating WC falling within inter-human variation. The average sensitivity of spike marking for WC was 91% and >87% for all three EEG reviewers. Finally, there was a strong visual and quantitative similarity between WC and EEG reviewers. Conclusions WC performance is indistinguishable to that of EEG reviewers\u2019 suggesting it could be a valid clinical tool for the assessment of IEDs. Significance WC can be used to provide quantitative analysis of epileptic spikes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Automated spike classification", "Information theory", "Interictal spike classification", "Intracranial EEG"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Adult", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Random Allocation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019634498", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"57194272044": {"Name": "Sharma N.K.", "AuthorID": "57194272044", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35901030200": {"Name": "Centeno M.", "AuthorID": "35901030200", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004000093": {"Name": "Chaudhary U.J.", "AuthorID": "7004000093", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55913795300": {"Name": "Wehner T.", "AuthorID": "55913795300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55881221300": {"Name": "Fran\u00e7a L.G.S.", "AuthorID": "55881221300", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55735370500": {"Name": "Yadee T.", "AuthorID": "55735370500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "53164472200": {"Name": "Murta T.", "AuthorID": "53164472200", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35722358600": {"Name": "Leite M.", "AuthorID": "35722358600", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36931857600": {"Name": "Vos S.B.", "AuthorID": "36931857600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7003810636": {"Name": "Diehl B.", "AuthorID": "7003810636", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7005729118": {"Name": "Lemieux L.", "AuthorID": "7005729118", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "55751743447": {"Name": "Pedreira C.", "AuthorID": "55751743447", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}}}
