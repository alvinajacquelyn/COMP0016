Methods Participants were 479 054 individuals from the UK Biobank. the exposures were self-reported social isolation and loneliness. aMi, stroke and mortality were the outcomes. results Over 7.1 years, 5731 had first aMi, and 3471 had first stroke. in model adjusted for demographics, social isolation was associated with higher risk of aMi (hr 1.43, 95% ci 1.3 to \u20131.55) and stroke (hr 1.39, 95% ci 1.25 to 1.54). When adjusted for all the other risk factors, the hr for aMi was attenuated by 84% to 1.07 (95% ci 0.99 to 1.16) and the hr for stroke was attenuated by 83% to 1.06 (95% ci 0.96 to 1.19). loneliness was associated with higher risk of aMi before (hr 1.49, 95% ci 1.36 to 1.64) but attenuated considerably with adjustments (hr 1.06, 95% ci 0.96 to 1.17). this was also the case for stroke (hr 1.36, 95% ci 1.20 to 1.55 before and hr 1.04, 95% ci 0.91 to 1.19 after adjustments). social isolation, but not loneliness, was associated with increased mortality in participants with a history of aMi (hr 1.25, 95% ci 1.03 to 1.51) or stroke (hr 1.32, 95% ci 1.08 to 1.61) in the fully adjusted model. Conclusions isolated and lonely persons are at increased risk of aMi and stroke, and, among those with a history of aMi or stroke, increased risk of death. Most of this risk was explained by conventional risk factors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Loneliness", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Registries", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Social Isolation", "Stroke", "Survival Rate", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049127544", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55347556900": {"Name": "Hakulinen C.", "AuthorID": "55347556900", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "8402684300": {"Name": "Pulkki-R\u00e5back L.", "AuthorID": "8402684300", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "16030844400": {"Name": "Jokela M.", "AuthorID": "16030844400", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}, "57200588411": {"Name": "Elovainio M.", "AuthorID": "57200588411", "AffiliationID": "60104546", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health and Welfare"}, "35239241500": {"Name": "Virtanen M.", "AuthorID": "35239241500", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public health and caring sciences, University of Uppsala"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60029080, 60002952", "AffiliationName": "Clinicum, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki"}}}
