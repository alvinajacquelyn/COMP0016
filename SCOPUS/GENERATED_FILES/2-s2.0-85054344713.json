A great deal of theoretical algorithmic development has been performed in support of this goal. Most techniques require a scheme for mapping electronic states and operations to states of and operations upon qubits. The two most commonly used techniques for this are the Jordan-Wigner transformation and the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation. However, comparisons of these schemes have previously been limited to individual small molecules. In this paper, we discuss resource implications for the use of the Bravyi-Kitaev mapping scheme, specifically with regard to the number of quantum gates required for simulation. We consider both small systems, which may be simulatable on near-future quantum devices, and systems sufficiently large for classical simulation to be intractable. We use 86 molecular systems to demonstrate that the use of the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation is typically at least approximately as efficient as the canonical Jordan-Wigner transformation and results in substantially reduced gate count estimates when performing limited circuit optimizations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054344713", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56705332800": {"Name": "Tranter A.", "AuthorID": "56705332800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "6603182591": {"Name": "Mintert F.", "AuthorID": "6603182591", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "8903073200": {"Name": "Love P.", "AuthorID": "8903073200", "AffiliationID": "60023143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Tufts University"}}}
