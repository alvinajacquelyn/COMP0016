Compound 1 was characterized by elemental analysis, infrared spectra, thermogravimetric analysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Structural analysis reveals that AsO2(OH)2\u2212 asymmetrically decorated the POM framework, constituting the first inorganic anion asymmetrically decorating a POM. AC measurements of the frequency-dependent \u03c7\u2032\u2032 below 5 K indicated a slow magnetization relaxation in 1, resembling typical single-molecule-magnet behavior. Photocatalytic experiments indicated that introduction of AsO2(OH)2\u2212 may offer new active sites and enhanced the overall photocatalytic activity compared with the C-type precursor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["asymmetrically decorating", "photocatalysis", "Polyanion", "single molecular magnet"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007140394", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"37162399600": {"Name": "Wu Q.", "AuthorID": "37162399600", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education, Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University"}, "8554837900": {"Name": "Wang B.", "AuthorID": "8554837900", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Science and Technology, Kunming University"}, "55627351700": {"Name": "Qiao Y.", "AuthorID": "55627351700", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Science and Technology, Kunming University"}, "57192656770": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57192656770", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Science and Technology, Kunming University"}, "57192650480": {"Name": "Wu W.", "AuthorID": "57192650480", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education, Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University"}, "56092126900": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "56092126900", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Yunnan Provincial Higher Education, Institutions for Organic Optoelectronic Materials and Devices, Kunming University"}, "56599815300": {"Name": "Ju H.", "AuthorID": "56599815300", "AffiliationID": "60084628", "AffiliationName": "Medical School, Kunming University"}}}
