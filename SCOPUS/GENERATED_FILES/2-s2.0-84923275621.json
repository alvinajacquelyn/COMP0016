Trial Design and Participants: An observer-masked, crossover randomised clinical trial on 15 oral and systemically healthy volunteers between 20-30 years who were randomly and sequentially allocated in the same group which performed 3 interventions in different randomised sequences. Intervention: The participants wore an appliance in 3 different rinsing periods doing mouthwashes twice a day (1/0/1) with essential oils, 0.2% chlorhexidine or sterile water (negative control). At the end of each 4-day mouthwash period, samples were removed from the appliance. Posteriorly, after bacterial vital staining, samples were analysed using a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. Main Outcome Measures: Bacterial vitality, thickness and covering grade by the biofilm after 4 days of applying each of the mouthwashes. Results: The essential oils and the 0.2% chlorhexidine were significantly more effective than the sterile water at reducing bacterial vitality, thickness and covering grade by the biofilm. No significant differences were found between the 0.2% chlorhexidine and the essential oils at reducing the bacterial vitality (13.2% vs. 14.7%). However, the 0.2% chlorhexidine showed more reduction than the essential oils in thickness (6.5 \u03bcm vs. 10.0 \u03bcm; p<0.05) and covering grade by the biofilm (20.0% vs. 54.3%; p<0.001). Conclusion: The essential oils and 0.2% chlorhexidine showed a high antiplaque effect. Although the 0.2% chlorhexidine showed better results with regard to reducing the thickness and covering grade by the biofilm, both antiseptics showed a high and similar antibacterial activity. Clinical Relevance: Daily essential oils or 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwashes are effective when reducing dental plaque formation in the short term. Although 0.2% chlorhexidine continues to be the \"gold standard\" in terms of antiplaque effect, essential oils could be considered a reliable alternative.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Infective Agents, Local", "Biofilms", "Chlorhexidine", "Cross-Over Studies", "Dental Plaque", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Microbial Viability", "Mouthwashes", "Oils, Volatile", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923275621", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56024974200": {"Name": "Quintas V.", "AuthorID": "56024974200", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Oral Sciences Research Group, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "56028506500": {"Name": "Prada-L\u00f3pez I.", "AuthorID": "56028506500", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Oral Sciences Research Group, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "6603427315": {"Name": "Su\u00e1rez-Quintanilla D.", "AuthorID": "6603427315", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Oral Sciences Research Group, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "7005882178": {"Name": "Tom\u00e1s I.", "AuthorID": "7005882178", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Oral Sciences Research Group, School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Santiago de Compostela"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
