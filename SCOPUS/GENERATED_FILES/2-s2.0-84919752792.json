Originally, adult-born neurons were considered to have excitatory effects on the DG network, but recent studies suggest a net inhibitory effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that selective removal of newborn neurons would lead to increased susceptibility to the effects of a convulsant. This hypothesis was tested by evaluating the response to the chemoconvulsant kainic acid (KA) in mice with reduced adult neurogenesis, produced either by focal X-irradiation of the DG, or by pharmacogenetic deletion of dividing radial glial precursors. In the first 4. hrs after KA administration, when mice have the most robust seizures, mice with reduced adult neurogenesis had more severe convulsive seizures, exhibited either as a decreased latency to the first convulsive seizure, greater number of convulsive seizures, or longer convulsive seizures. Nonconvulsive seizures did not appear to change or they decreased. Four-21. hrs after KA injection, mice with reduced adult neurogenesis showed more interictal spikes (IIS) and delayed seizures than controls. Effects were greater when the anticonvulsant ethosuximide was injected 30. min prior to KA administration; ethosuximide allows forebrain seizure activity to be more easily examined in mice by suppressing seizures dominated by the brainstem. These data support the hypothesis that reduction of adult-born neurons increases the susceptibility of the brain to effects of KA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Convulsive seizures", "Dentate gyrus", "Electroencephalography (EEG)", "Epilepsy", "Hippocampus", "Inhibition", "Interictal spikes (IIS)", "Subgranular zone (SGZ)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anticonvulsants", "Disease Models, Animal", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Electroencephalography", "Ethosuximide", "Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists", "Ganciclovir", "Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein", "Hippocampus", "Kainic Acid", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Neural Stem Cells", "Neurogenesis", "Neuropeptides", "Seizures", "Thymidine Kinase", "X-Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919752792", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"56039834300": {"Name": "Iyengar S.S.", "AuthorID": "56039834300", "AffiliationID": "60006463", "AffiliationName": "Center for Dementia Research, The Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research"}, "6602208330": {"Name": "LaFrancois J.J.", "AuthorID": "6602208330", "AffiliationID": "60006463", "AffiliationName": "Center for Dementia Research, The Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research"}, "7003664603": {"Name": "Scharfman H.E.", "AuthorID": "7003664603", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Physiology and Neuroscience and Psychiatry, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "7402079601": {"Name": "Friedman D.", "AuthorID": "7402079601", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "7005596611": {"Name": "Drew L.J.", "AuthorID": "7005596611", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "WIBR, University College of London"}, "13002829100": {"Name": "Denny C.A.", "AuthorID": "13002829100", "AffiliationID": "60011605, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons"}, "35182315400": {"Name": "Wu M.V.", "AuthorID": "35182315400", "AffiliationID": "60011605, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons"}, "7005852886": {"Name": "Hen R.", "AuthorID": "7005852886", "AffiliationID": "60029358", "AffiliationName": "New York State Psychiatric Institute"}, "6505793415": {"Name": "Burghardt N.S.", "AuthorID": "6505793415", "AffiliationID": "60002896, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Hunter College, City University of New York"}, "7401435605": {"Name": "Hsieh J.", "AuthorID": "7401435605", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neurobiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"}}}
