Only a minority of lipids achieve their final intracellular distribution through transport by vesicles. Instead, the bulk of lipid traffic is mediated by a large group of lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), which move small numbers of lipids at a time using hydrophobic cavities that stabilize lipid molecules outside membranes. Although the first LTPs were discovered almost 50 years ago, most progress in understanding these proteins has been made in the past few years, leading to considerable temporal and spatial refinement of our understanding of the function of these lipid transporters. The number of known LTPs has increased, with exciting discoveries of their multimeric assembly. Structural studies of LTPs have progressed from static crystal structures to dynamic structural approaches that show how conformational changes contribute to lipid handling at a sub-millisecond timescale. A major development has been the finding that many intracellular LTPs localize to two organelles at the same time, forming a shuttle, bridge or tube that links donor and acceptor compartments. The understanding of how different lipids achieve their final destination at the molecular level allows a better explanation of the range of defects that occur in diseases associated with lipid transport and distribution, opening up the possibility of developing therapies that specifically target lipid transfer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Transport", "Carrier Proteins", "Cell Membrane", "Humans", "Membrane Lipids", "Organelles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055271267", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55606531200": {"Name": "Wong L.", "AuthorID": "55606531200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7102551297": {"Name": "Levine T.", "AuthorID": "7102551297", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "55605873000": {"Name": "Gatta A.", "AuthorID": "55605873000", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Crick Institute"}}}
