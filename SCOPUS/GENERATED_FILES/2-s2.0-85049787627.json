In the first place we introduce the physical laws governing the ECT system. Then we will focus on optimization techniques in terms of various hardware settings, and signal processing algorithms that are capable to recover the cross sectional image of the internal characteristics of a specified region based on the measuring capacitances data of multi-electrode sensors. Among these approaches, we will investigate their advantages and limitations, and analyze the algorithms which have been examined through simulations or physical experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrical capacitance tomography", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Regularization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Advanced measurement techniques", "Complex multiphase flows", "Electrical Capacitance Tomography", "Image reconstruction algorithm", "Internal characteristics", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Regularization", "Signal processing algorithms"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049787627", "SubjectAreas": [["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"55488020900": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "55488020900", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "7005067661": {"Name": "Cong S.", "AuthorID": "7005067661", "AffiliationID": "60019118", "AffiliationName": "Department of Automation, University of Science and Technology of China"}}}
