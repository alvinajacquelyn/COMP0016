In so doing, we answer a question of Hayman by showing that all such solutions have finite order. Apart from special choices of the coefficient functions, the general solution is not meromorphic and contains movable branch points. For some choices for the coefficient functions, the equation admits a one-parameter family of nonrational meromorphic solutions. Nevanlinna theory is used to show that all such solutions have been found and allows us to avoid issues that can arise from the fact that resonances can occur at arbitrarily high orders. We actually solve the more general problem of finding all meromorphic solutions that are admissible in the sense of Nevanlinna theory, where the coefficients \\alpha, \\beta, and \\gamma are meromorphic functions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946214182", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"6603577604": {"Name": "Halburd R.", "AuthorID": "6603577604", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55954403200": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55954403200", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University"}}}
