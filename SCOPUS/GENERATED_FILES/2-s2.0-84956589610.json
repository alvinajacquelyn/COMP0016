Psychiatry", "Volume": "86", "Issue": 12, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 1307, "PageEnd": 1313, "CitedBy": 8, "DOI": "10.1136/jnnp-2014-307959", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84956589610&origin=inward", "Abstract": "Objective: 61 procedures with selective peripheral denervation for cervical dystonia were retrospectively analysed concerning surgical results, pain, quality of life (QoL) and recurrences. Methods: The patients were assessed with the Tsui torticollis scale, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain and Fugl-Meyer scale for QoL. Evaluations were performed preoperatively, early postoperatively, at 6 months, then at a mean of 42 (13-165) months. All patients underwent electromyogram at baseline, which was repeated in cases who presented with recurrence of symptoms after surgery. Results: Six months of follow-up was available for 55 (90%) of the procedures and late follow-up for 34 (56%). The mean score of the Tsui scale was 10 preoperatively. It improved to 4.5 (p<0.001) at 6 months, and 5.3 (p<0.001) at late follow-up. VAS for pain improved from 6.5 preoperatively to 4.2 (p<0.001) at 6 months and 4 (p<0.01) at late follow-up. The Fugl-Meyer score for QoL improved from 43.3 to 46.6 (p<0.05) at 6 months, and to 51.1 (p<0.05) at late follow-up. Major reinnervation and/or change in the dystonic pattern occurred following 29% of the procedures, and led in 26% of patients to reoperation with either additional denervation or pallidal stimulation. Conclusions: Selective peripheral denervation remains a surgical option in the treatment of cervical dystonia when conservative measures fail. Although the majority of patients experience a significant relief of symptoms, there is a substantial risk of reinnervation and/or change in the pattern of the cervical dystonia.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Electromyography", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Globus Pallidus", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle Denervation", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Pain", "Pain Measurement", "Peripheral Nerves", "Quality of Life", "Recurrence", "Retrospective Studies", "Torticollis", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956589610", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7005839919": {"Name": "Bergenheim A.", "AuthorID": "7005839919", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Section of Neurosurgery, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "15850670300": {"Name": "Larsson E.", "AuthorID": "15850670300", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Section of Neurosurgery, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603627505": {"Name": "Nordh E.", "AuthorID": "6603627505", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Section of Neurophysiology, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
