Empirical strategies involve screening many excipient and buffer combinations using force degradation studies. Such methods do not readily provide information on intermolecular interactions responsible for the protective effects of excipients. This study describes a molecular docking approach to screen and rank interactions allowing for theidentification of protein-excipient hotspots to aid in the selection of excipients to be experimentally screened. Previously published work with Drosophila Su(dx) was used to develop and validate the computational methodology, which was then used to determine the formulation hotspots for Fab A33. Commonly used excipients were examined and compared to the regions in Fab A33 prone to protein-protein interactions that could lead to aggregation. This approach could provide information on a molecular level about the protective interactions of excipients in protein formulations to aid the more rational development of future formulations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fab formulation", "Molecular docking", "Molecular dynamics", "Protein stability", "Protein-excipient interactions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acids", "Binding Sites", "Computer Simulation", "Excipients", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Conformation", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Stability", "Proteins", "Reproducibility of Results", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971518975", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"36888034500": {"Name": "Barata T.S.", "AuthorID": "36888034500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutics"}, "57189511063": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "57189511063", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Emergent Macromolecular Therapies, University College London, Biochemical Engineering Department"}, "6701589883": {"Name": "Dalby P.A.", "AuthorID": "6701589883", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Emergent Macromolecular Therapies, University College London, Biochemical Engineering Department"}, "6701323615": {"Name": "Brocchini S.", "AuthorID": "6701323615", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutics"}, "6603596752": {"Name": "Zloh M.", "AuthorID": "6603596752", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Pharmacology and Postgraduate Medicine, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
