The technique was initially used for breast reconstruction but later found its use in reconstruction of excisional defects resulting from a variety of causes including surgery for post-burn/post-traumatic deformities, congenital giant naevi, skin cancer, etc. It offers an improved matching of skin colour and texture, and avoids the high infrastructure requirements of microsurgery for free flap transfers. We present a systematic literature review of 35 worldwide English language articles with representative cases of paediatric tissue expansion reconstruction of burn injuries of the head and neck. The review identified 68 children of an average age of 11.3 years. The most common burn aetiology was flame burn injury. The average area to be reconstructed was of 206 cm2 and patients went through expansion processes for an average of 99.7 days. Three articles included cases in which patients had more than one expansion session. Supportive techniques provide examples of developments in the area of tissue expansion reconstruction such as self-inflating expanders and endoscopic approaches. Further studies focussing on particular indications, age groups and anatomical locations of tissues to be expanded are required in order to improve the understanding of this technique's limitations and continue its development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Burn injury", "Children", "Head and neck", "Paediatrics", "Reconstruction", "Tissue expansion"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056448321", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"56410801600": {"Name": "De La Cruz Monroy M.F.I.", "AuthorID": "56410801600", "AffiliationID": "60007974, 60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Leicester Royal Infirmary, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "24070966200": {"Name": "Kalaskar D.M.", "AuthorID": "24070966200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, University College London"}, "6507138245": {"Name": "Rauf K.G.", "AuthorID": "6507138245", "AffiliationID": "60007974, 60028485", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic Surgery, Leicester Royal Infirmary, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}}}
