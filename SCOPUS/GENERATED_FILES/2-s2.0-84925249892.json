The DNA extraction method is based on ethanol precipitation supplemented by pretreatment steps with a MolYsis kit or saline wash for the removal of human DNA and a final DNA cleanup step with solid-phase reversible immobilization beads. The protocol yielded \u22650.2 ng/\u03bcl of DNA for 90% (MolYsis kit) and 83% (saline wash) of positive MGIT cultures. A total of 144 (94%) of the 154 samples sequenced on the MiSeq platform (Illumina) achieved the target of 1 million reads, with <5% of reads derived from human or nasopharyngeal flora for 88% and 91% of samples, respectively. A total of 59 (98%) of 60 samples that were identified by the national mycobacterial reference laboratory (NMRL) as Mycobacterium tuberculosis were successfully mapped to the H37Rv reference, with >90% coverage achieved. The DNA extraction protocol, therefore, will facilitate fast and accurate identification of mycobacterial species and resistance using a range of bioinformatics tools.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacteriological Techniques", "DNA, Bacterial", "Genome, Bacterial", "Humans", "Molecular Typing", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925249892", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"]], "AuthorData": {"36980238500": {"Name": "Votintseva A.A.", "AuthorID": "36980238500", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "32367751700": {"Name": "Pankhurst L.J.", "AuthorID": "32367751700", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "56368438000": {"Name": "Anson L.W.", "AuthorID": "56368438000", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "55562321300": {"Name": "Walker T.M.", "AuthorID": "55562321300", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "56562645400": {"Name": "Quan T.P.", "AuthorID": "56562645400", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "57210425984": {"Name": "Wyllie D.H.", "AuthorID": "57210425984", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60175818", "AffiliationName": "Jenner Institute, University of Oxford"}, "55944520700": {"Name": "Del Ojo Elias C.", "AuthorID": "55944520700", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "35402208300": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "35402208300", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7005772816": {"Name": "Peto T.E.A.", "AuthorID": "7005772816", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "7102132600": {"Name": "Crook D.W.", "AuthorID": "7102132600", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research, Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "6603904092": {"Name": "Gascoyne-Binzi D.", "AuthorID": "6603904092", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Leeds General Infirmary"}, "55446626100": {"Name": "Wilcox M.", "AuthorID": "55446626100", "AffiliationID": "60006866", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology, Leeds General Infirmary"}, "7403025417": {"Name": "Morgan M.R.", "AuthorID": "7403025417", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Microbiology Laboratory, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
