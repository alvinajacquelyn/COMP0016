This framework has traditionally provided an attractive approach to incorporating more realistic contact structure into epidemic models, since it often preserves analytic tractability (in stochastic as well as deterministic models) but also captures the most salient structural inhomogeneity in contact patterns in many applied contexts. Despite the progress that has been made in both the theory and application of such metapopulation models, we present here several major challenges that remain for future work, focusing on models that, in contrast to agent-based ones, are amenable to mathematical analysis. The challenges range from clarifying the usefulness of systems of weakly-coupled large sub-populations in modelling the spread of specific diseases to developing a theory for endemic models with household structure. They include also developing inferential methods for data on the emerging phase of epidemics, extending metapopulation models to more complex forms of human social structure, developing metapopulation models to reflect spatial population structure, developing computationally efficient methods for calculating key epidemiological model quantities, and integrating within- and between-host dynamics in models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Households", "Large sub-populations", "Metapopulations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communicable Diseases", "Epidemics", "Family Characteristics", "Humans", "Models, Statistical", "Population Dynamics", "Spatial Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938363406", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7006744795": {"Name": "Ball F.", "AuthorID": "7006744795", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Nottingham, University Park"}, "35232527500": {"Name": "Britton T.", "AuthorID": "35232527500", "AffiliationID": "60028378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Stockholm University"}, "6701370105": {"Name": "House T.", "AuthorID": "6701370105", "AffiliationID": "60163091, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research Centre (WIDER), Warwick Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick"}, "25030661700": {"Name": "Pellis L.", "AuthorID": "25030661700", "AffiliationID": "60163091, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Infectious Disease Epidemiology Research Centre (WIDER), Warwick Mathematics Institute, University of Warwick"}, "6701600227": {"Name": "Isham V.", "AuthorID": "6701600227", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6701779073": {"Name": "Mollison D.", "AuthorID": "6701779073", "AffiliationID": "60019656", "AffiliationName": "Department of Actuarial Mathematics and Statistics, Heriot-Watt University"}, "6603080378": {"Name": "Scalia Tomba G.", "AuthorID": "6603080378", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Rome Tor Vergata"}}}
