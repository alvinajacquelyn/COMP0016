Folate receptor alpha (FR\u03b1) is a central mediator of cell growth regulation that could serve as an important target for cancer therapy. Experimental Design: We evaluated FR\u03b1 expression in breast cancers by genomic (n = 3,414) and IHC (n = 323) analyses and its association with clinical parameters and outcomes. We measured the functional contributions of FR\u03b1 in TNBC biology by RNA interference and the antitumor functions of an antibody recognizing FR\u03b1 (MOv18-IgG1), in vitro, and in human TNBC xenograft models. Results: FR\u03b1 is overexpressed in significant proportions of aggressive basal like/TNBC tumors, and in postneoadjuvant chemotherapy-residual disease associated with a high risk of relapse. Expression is associated with worse overall survival. TNBCs show dysregulated expression of thymidylate synthase, folate hydrolase 1, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, involved in folate metabolism. RNA interference to deplete FR\u03b1 decreased Src and ERK signaling and resulted in reduction of cell growth. An anti-FR\u03b1 antibody (MOv18-IgG1) conjugated with a Src inhibitor significantly restricted TNBC xenograft growth. Moreover, MOv18-IgG1 triggered immunedependent cancer cell death in vitro by human volunteer and breast cancer patient immune cells, and significantly restricted orthotopic and patient-derived xenograft growth. Conclusions: FR\u03b1 is overexpressed in high-grade TNBC and postchemotherapy residual tumors. It participates in cancer cell signaling and presents a promising target for therapeutic strategies such as ADCs, or passive immunotherapy priming Fc-mediated antitumor immune cell responses.",
