This is surprising given the implications for patient care, the evaluation of novel treatments or preventative strategies, and also health policy. Furthermore, there is no validated TB-specific instrument that measures health status, and thus a wide and non-standardized range of assessment tools have been employed. The studies to date have chosen a number of different comparator populations, and in many TB endemic areas there is a lack of normative data regarding the health status of the general population. Systematic evaluations of quality of life are urgently needed in specific groups, including those with extrapulmonary TB, drug-resistant disease, HIV co-infection, and latent TB infection, and in children with TB; the assessment of post-treatment disability is also required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Health economics", "Health status", "Measures of health", "Quality of life", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Coinfection", "Female", "Health Status", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Morbidity", "Quality of Life", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925257708", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55547124592": {"Name": "Brown J.", "AuthorID": "55547124592", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, and Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "55363218700": {"Name": "Capocci S.", "AuthorID": "55363218700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, and Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60170516", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Respiratory Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, London, and Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7501658889": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "7501658889", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "57210018355": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "57210018355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London, London, and Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}}}
