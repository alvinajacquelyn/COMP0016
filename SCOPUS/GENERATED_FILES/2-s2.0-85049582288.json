Through nonlinear dynamic analysis conducted using hybrid broadband simulated ground motions and real records for two historical earthquakes; i.e., the 1989 M 6.8 Loma Prieta earthquake and the 1994 M 6.7 Northridge earthquake, it is demonstrated that the distributions of column drift ratios, deck rotations and displacements produced by simulations agree reasonably well with those produced by recorded ground motions. Ground motion intensity measures related to ground motion directionality and directivity are finally compared for both simulations and recorded waveforms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ground Motion Directionality", "Hybrid Broadband Simulation", "Skewed Bridges", "Statistical Hypothesis Testing", "Time-History Analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Broadband simulations", "Ground motions", "Skewed bridges", "Statistical hypothesis testing", "Time history analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049582288", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"]], "AuthorData": {"26537243900": {"Name": "Galasso C.", "AuthorID": "26537243900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering and Institute for Risk & Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "55486360200": {"Name": "Tsioulou A.", "AuthorID": "55486360200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering and Institute for Risk & Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "6504557105": {"Name": "Kaviani P.", "AuthorID": "6504557105", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}, "10539883600": {"Name": "Zareian F.", "AuthorID": "10539883600", "AffiliationID": "60007278", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}}}
