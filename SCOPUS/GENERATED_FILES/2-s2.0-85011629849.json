A set of seven questions concerning these topics was created by the authors to guide the interviews. Interviews were conducted during spring 2016 with 12 museum professionals representing 10 UK-based museums, galleries or historic property management groups. All interviewees noted that their principal responsibility with regards to lighting was in controlling the impact of lighting on material damage. This generally involved the monitoring and analysis of existing lighting systems and natural illumination, creating general guidance documents for the specification of lighting in their specific institutions and for loan items, and providing guidance and recommendations for the fitting out of new galleries or gallery refits. Furthermore, the range of roles played in the procurement of lighting varied amongst those interviewed. Whilst some created guidance documents which would then be passed on to estates teams and exhibition designers or lighting designers specifically, others had a much more hands-on role, testing specific lighting before installation or making recommendations on a case-by-case basis. Asked to present a list or range of priorities, many focused on prioritizing the safety requirements of lighting. The principal safety concern for lighting was that it fell below specific illuminance criteria, dependent on the assumed sensitivity category of the object in question. Most interviewees were aware of warnings which had been issued and well publicised in the mainstream press regards the potential of LED sources to be especially degrading for specific objects.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colour rendering", "colour temperature", "energy reduction", "light-emitting diode (LED)", "lighting specification", "museum lighting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Colour rendering", "Energy reduction", "Guidance document", "Light emitting diode (LED)", "Monitoring and analysis", "Natural illumination", "Property management", "Safety requirements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011629849", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57193199773": {"Name": "Garside D.", "AuthorID": "57193199773", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7103387453": {"Name": "MacDonald L.", "AuthorID": "7103387453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "7102138821": {"Name": "Robson S.", "AuthorID": "7102138821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental & Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "22952969300": {"Name": "Curran K.", "AuthorID": "22952969300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage"}, "6506367951": {"Name": "Korenberg C.", "AuthorID": "6506367951", "AffiliationID": "60003455", "AffiliationName": "Department of Conservation and Scientific Research, British Museum"}, "16242674000": {"Name": "Teunissen K.", "AuthorID": "16242674000", "AffiliationID": "60016561", "AffiliationName": "Philips Research Eindhoven"}}}
