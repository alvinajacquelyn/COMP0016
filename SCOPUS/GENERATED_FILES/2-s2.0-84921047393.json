We show in this letter which arrangement of diodes and resistances is compatible with experimental multilevel set and reset I-V characteristics in electroformed TiN/SiOx/TiN structures. The proposed model is based on the solution of the generalized diode equation corresponding to N diodes arranged in parallel with a single series resistance. The model is simple yet accurate and it is able to capture the essential features exhibited by the I-V curves in the low and high bias regimes, revealing that a single equation can deal with both the low and high resistance states. An exact expression for the differential conductance suitable for small-signal analysis and circuit simulators is also provided.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metal-insulator-metal (MIM)", "resistive switching", "SiOx"], "IndexKeywords": ["Differential conductances", "Diode-like conduction", "Filamentary conduction", "High-resistance state", "Metal insulator metals", "Resistive switching", "SiOx", "Small-signal analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921047393", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"7101835156": {"Name": "Miranda E.", "AuthorID": "7101835156", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament d'Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "56010454900": {"Name": "Blasco J.", "AuthorID": "56010454900", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament d'Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "7006591979": {"Name": "Sune J.", "AuthorID": "7006591979", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Departament d'Enginyeria Electr\u00f2nica, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona"}, "55236732600": {"Name": "Mehonic A.", "AuthorID": "55236732600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7005715736": {"Name": "Kenyon A.", "AuthorID": "7005715736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
