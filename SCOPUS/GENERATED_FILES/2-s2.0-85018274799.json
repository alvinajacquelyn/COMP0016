In this article, I consider the argumentative strategy Spinoza uses here\u2013and its intellectual history\u2013in depth. I argue that Spinoza\u2019s method is best characterised as a genealogical analysis. As I recount, by Spinoza\u2019s time of writing, these kinds of arguments already had a long and illustrious history. However, I also argue that, in his adoption of such strategies, we have good reason to think Spinoza\u2019s primary influence was Gersonides. Elucidating this aspect of Spinoza\u2019s critique of his contemporaries\u2019 axiologies brings a number of explicatory and historical boons. However, regrettably, it also comes at a cost, revealing a significant flaw in Spinoza\u2019s reasoning. Towards the end of this article, I consider the nature of this flaw, whether Spinoza can avoid it and its ramifications for Spinoza\u2019s wider philosophical project.", "AuthorKeywords": ["axiology", "Ethics", "genealogy", "Gersonides", "Spinoza", "values"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018274799", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"36667338000": {"Name": "Rumbold B.", "AuthorID": "36667338000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}}}
