We developed a novel computational method, implemented as Flynotyper software (http://flynotyper.sourceforge.net), to quantitatively assess the morphological defects in the Drosophila eye resulting from genetic alterations affecting basic cellular and developmental processes. Flynotyper utilizes a series of image processing operations to automatically detect the fly eye and the individual ommatidium, and calculates a phenotypic score as a measure of the disorderliness of ommatidial arrangement in the fly eye. As a proof of principle, we tested our method by analyzing the defects due to eye-specific knockdown of Drosophila orthologs of 12 neurodevelopmental genes to accurately document differential sensitivities of these genes to dosage alteration. We also evaluated eye images from six independent studies assessing the effect of overexpression of repeats, candidates from peptide library screens, and modifiers of neurotoxicity and developmental processes on eye morphology, and show strong concordance with the original assessment. We further demonstrate the utility of this method by analyzing 16 modifiers of sine oculis obtained from two genome-wide deficiency screens of Drosophila and accurately quantifying the effect of its enhancers and suppressors during eye development. Our method will complement existing assays for eye phenotypes, and increase the accuracy of studies that use fly eyes for functional evaluation of genes and genetic interactions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Drosophila melanogaster", "Human disease models", "Modifier screens", "Neuro-developmental disorders", "Ommatidia", "Rough eye"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Animals, Genetically Modified", "Drosophila melanogaster", "Drosophila Proteins", "Eye", "Gene Knockdown Techniques", "Genetic Association Studies", "Models, Genetic", "Neurogenesis", "Phenotype", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966356789", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"54789719300": {"Name": "Iyer J.", "AuthorID": "54789719300", "AffiliationID": "60103339, 60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University"}, "56050605300": {"Name": "Pizzo L.", "AuthorID": "56050605300", "AffiliationID": "60103339, 60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University"}, "57189218272": {"Name": "Srivastava A.", "AuthorID": "57189218272", "AffiliationID": "60103339, 60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The Huck Institutes of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University"}, "8973262400": {"Name": "Girirajan S.", "AuthorID": "8973262400", "AffiliationID": "60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, The Pennsylvania State University"}, "56097737200": {"Name": "Wang Q.", "AuthorID": "56097737200", "AffiliationID": "60103339, 60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics Program, The Huck Institutes of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University"}, "57189214559": {"Name": "Le T.", "AuthorID": "57189214559", "AffiliationID": "60103339, 60001439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioinformatics and Genomics Program, The Huck Institutes of Life Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University"}, "6507547538": {"Name": "Gr\u00f6nke S.", "AuthorID": "6507547538", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Biological Mechanisms of Ageing, Max-Planck Institute for Biology of Aging"}, "57202667589": {"Name": "Partridge L.", "AuthorID": "57202667589", "AffiliationID": "60103814", "AffiliationName": "Biological Mechanisms of Ageing, Max-Planck Institute for Biology of Aging"}, "8749778900": {"Name": "Ambegaokar S.S.", "AuthorID": "8749778900", "AffiliationID": "60015120", "AffiliationName": "Department of Botany and Microbiology, Ohio Wesleyan University"}, "56658211800": {"Name": "Imai Y.", "AuthorID": "56658211800", "AffiliationID": "60172370", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research for Parkinson's Disease, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "57189214388": {"Name": "Trois\u00ed B.L.", "AuthorID": "57189214388", "AffiliationID": "113116027", "AffiliationName": "Incliva Health Research Institute"}, "6603280645": {"Name": "Artero R.", "AuthorID": "6603280645", "AffiliationID": "113116027", "AffiliationName": "Incliva Health Research Institute"}, "7004219801": {"Name": "Mardon G.", "AuthorID": "7004219801", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "56162447400": {"Name": "Jackson G.R.", "AuthorID": "56162447400", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "7005469062": {"Name": "Isaacs A.M.", "AuthorID": "7005469062", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "34771714700": {"Name": "Lu B.", "AuthorID": "34771714700", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Stanford University"}, "7201861857": {"Name": "Kumar J.P.", "AuthorID": "7201861857", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Indiana University"}}}
