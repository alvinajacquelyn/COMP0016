The ultimate goal is to replace a needle biopsy which typically follows the detection of an abnormality in mammographic images. Here we report the non-invasive detection of calcium oxalate monohydrate in tissue through 40 mm of phantom tissues using our recently developed advanced Raman instrument complementing our previous detection of calcium hydroxyapatite through this thickness of tissue. The ability to detect these two key types of calcifications opens avenues for the development of non-invasive in-vivo breast cancer diagnostic tool in the future.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Calcium oxalate", "Hydroxyapatite", "Raman spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Cancer", "Breast cancer diagnostics", "Calcium hydroxyapatite", "Calcium oxalate monohydrate", "Calcium oxalates", "Molecular information", "Non-invasive detection", "Transmission raman spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047649742", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"8307544100": {"Name": "Ghita A.", "AuthorID": "8307544100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter, Streatham Campus"}, "7202511172": {"Name": "Stone N.", "AuthorID": "7202511172", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter, Streatham Campus"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
