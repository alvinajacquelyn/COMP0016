While studies are increasingly examining residential mobility motivations using the reasons reported in social surveys, data constraints and the conceptual legacy of behavioural theories mean that little is known about how people's reasons for desiring and making residential moves vary over the life course. In this paper, we address these issues using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey. The results show that the reasons people report for desiring to move vary considerably over the life course. People are more likely to relocate if they desire to move for 'targeted' reasons like employment opportunities than if they desire to move for more 'diffuse' reasons relating to area characteristics. Life course events and moving desires intersect to strongly condition moving behaviour. These insights demonstrate how a deep engagement with life course theories can help researchers to overcome the difficulties encountered when using behavioural models to understand moving decisions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Life course", "Migration", "Motivation", "Reason", "Residential mobility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928433837", "SubjectAreas": [["Demography", "SOCI", "3317"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"54392755000": {"Name": "Coulter R.", "AuthorID": "54392755000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Cambridge"}, "57212979074": {"Name": "Scott J.", "AuthorID": "57212979074", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Cambridge"}}}
