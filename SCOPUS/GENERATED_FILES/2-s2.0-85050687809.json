Recent findings show that memory functioning can also be compromised early in the course of disease. In this study, we investigated the neural basis of memory impairment in PCA, and hypothesised that correlations would be observed with parietal cortex rather than classic medial temporal memory structures. Methods: Eighteen PCA patients, 15 typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD) patients and 21 healthy controls underwent memory testing with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) word list and MRI. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to identify regions in the parietal and medial temporal lobes that correlated with memory performance. Results: Compared with controls, PCA patients were impaired at learning, immediate and delayed recall and recognition of the RAVLT. Learning rate and immediate recall was significantly better in PCA compared to tAD, whereas there was no difference in delayed recall. Recognition memory also was not statistically different between patient groups, but PCA patients made significantly more false positive errors than tAD patients. VBM analysis in the PCA patients revealed a significant correlation between total learning and grey matter density in the right supramarginal gyrus, right angular gyrus and left postcentral gyrus. The left post central gyrus also significantly correlated with immediate and delayed recall and with recognition memory. No correlations were detected in the medial temporal lobe. Conclusions: The findings provide novel evidence that early verbal memory impairment is frequently observed in PCA, and is associated with damage to lateral parietal structures. The results have implications for the diagnosis and management of PCA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Attention", "Episodic memory", "Posterior cortical atrophy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Atrophy", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Memory", "Memory Disorders", "Mental Recall", "Middle Aged", "Parietal Lobe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050687809", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"57204879232": {"Name": "Ahmed S.", "AuthorID": "57204879232", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "25423301000": {"Name": "Zamboni G.", "AuthorID": "25423301000", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroscience and Neurotechnology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "7201522757": {"Name": "Husain M.", "AuthorID": "7201522757", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford"}, "11641250900": {"Name": "Butler C.", "AuthorID": "11641250900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60008323", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "36118093600": {"Name": "Loane C.", "AuthorID": "36118093600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57202906707": {"Name": "Bartels S.", "AuthorID": "57202906707", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology and Alzheimer Centre Limburg, School for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Maastricht University"}, "57196084116": {"Name": "Mackay C.", "AuthorID": "57196084116", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7102890122": {"Name": "Baker I.", "AuthorID": "7102890122", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Russell Cairns Unit, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7403233808": {"Name": "Thompson S.", "AuthorID": "7403233808", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurology, Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8682297900": {"Name": "Hornberger M.", "AuthorID": "8682297900", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}}}
