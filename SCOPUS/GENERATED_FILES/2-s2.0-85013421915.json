In particular, we quantify two approaches to diversify a country's supplier portfolio: by lowering the dependency on each supplier (portfolio diversification) and by having embodied energy suppliers that are different from its direct energy suppliers (portfolio differentiation). We examine possibilities for strategic utilization of embodied energy trade to compensate for low diversity of direct energy trade for three types of fossil resources: coal, oil, and gas. We find that the diversity of embodied energy import is much greater than that of direct energy import. Of the three energy resources, coal enables countries to adopt portfolio diversification and portfolio differentiation more than gas and oil. Our results suggest embodied energy can be considered as a transfer of energy resources across national borders that can directly benefit from the diversity of the world energy production by \u201cskipping\u201d the limited diversity of the world energy export.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diversity", "Embodied energy", "Input-output model", "International trade", "Resilience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Diversity", "Embodied energy", "Energy suppliers", "Fossil resources", "Input output model", "Portfolio diversification", "Resilience", "Supplier portfolios"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013421915", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56895412100": {"Name": "Sato M.", "AuthorID": "56895412100", "AffiliationID": "60006559", "AffiliationName": "Cabinet Office Government of Japan"}, "55618270300": {"Name": "Kharrazi A.", "AuthorID": "55618270300", "AffiliationID": "60019497", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Systems Analysis Program International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)"}, "56927498400": {"Name": "Nakayama H.", "AuthorID": "56927498400", "AffiliationID": "115905349", "AffiliationName": "InterGreen Research Institute"}, "23037745200": {"Name": "Yarime M.", "AuthorID": "23037745200", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Environment, City University of Hong Kong"}, "7003802385": {"Name": "Kraines S.", "AuthorID": "7003802385", "AffiliationID": "60009824", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of liberal Arts and Sciences, Tokyo City University"}}}
