Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The Topo2a-dependent arrest is associated with faithful segregation of sister chromatids and has been identified as dysfunctional in numerous tumour cell lines. This genome-protecting pathway is poorly understood and its characterization is of significant interest, potentially offering interventional opportunities in relation to synthetic lethal behaviours in arrest-defective tumours. Using the catalytic Topo2a inhibitor ICRF193, we have performed a genome-wide siRNA screen in arrest-competent, non-transformed cells, to identify genes essential for this arrest mechanism. In addition, we have counter-screened several DNA-damaging agents and demonstrate that the Topo2a-dependent arrest is genetically distinct from DNA damage checkpoints. We identify the components of the SMC5/6 complex, including the activity of the E3 SUMO ligase NSE2, as non-redundant players that control the timing of the Topo2a-dependent arrest in G2. We have independently verified the NSE2 requirement in fibroblasts from patients with germline mutations that cause severely reduced levels of NSE2. Through imaging Topo2a-dependent G2 arrested cells, an increased interaction between Topo2a and NSE2 is observed at PML bodies, which are known SUMOylation hotspots. We demonstrate that Topo2a is SUMOylated in an ICRF193-dependent manner by NSE2 at a novel non-canonical site (K1520) and that K1520 sumoylation is required for chromosome segregation but not the G2 arrest.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Line", "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone", "DNA Damage", "DNA Topoisomerases, Type II", "Fibroblasts", "G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Genome, Human", "Germ-Line Mutation", "Humans", "Ligases", "Multiprotein Complexes", "Piperazines", "Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins", "RNA Interference", "Sumoylation", "Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064483377", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"55305552800": {"Name": "Deiss K.", "AuthorID": "55305552800", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "57220386279": {"Name": "Lockwood N.", "AuthorID": "57220386279", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "57136791800": {"Name": "Segeren H.A.", "AuthorID": "57136791800", "AffiliationID": "60117218, 60117220, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University"}, "57200211212": {"Name": "Soliman T.N.", "AuthorID": "57200211212", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "56725174500": {"Name": "Martini S.", "AuthorID": "56725174500", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Francis Crick Institute"}, "7202013506": {"Name": "Parker P.J.", "AuthorID": "7202013506", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, New Hunt's House, Guy's Campus"}, "7102829788": {"Name": "Howell M.", "AuthorID": "7102829788", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "High Throughput Screening, Francis Crick Institute"}, "8694786300": {"Name": "Saunders R.E.", "AuthorID": "8694786300", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "High Throughput Screening, Francis Crick Institute"}, "55403192700": {"Name": "Chakravarty P.", "AuthorID": "55403192700", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics, Francis Crick Institute"}, "35191046800": {"Name": "Rocha N.", "AuthorID": "35191046800", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120909", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science"}, "56673851200": {"Name": "Semple R.", "AuthorID": "56673851200", "AffiliationID": "60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre"}, "24451551900": {"Name": "Zalmas L.P.", "AuthorID": "24451551900", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Translational Cancer Therapeutics, Francis Crick Institute"}}}
