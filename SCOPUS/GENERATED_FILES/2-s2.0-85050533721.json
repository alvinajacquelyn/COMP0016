The issue of suitability has been largely overlooked in previous research; for instance, casts and reconstruction methods are frequently used to increase sample sizes, without sufficient assessment of the effect, this may have on the accuracy and reliability of results. Furthermore, the reliability of geometric morphometric methods and the implications of virtual curation have not received sufficient consideration. This paper discusses the suitability of 3D research with regard to the accuracy, reliability, and accessibility of methods and materials, as well as the effects of the current learning environment. Areas where future work will progress 3D research are proposed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D digitisation", "Accessibility", "Accuracy", "Geometric morphometrics", "Reliability", "Suitability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050533721", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"]], "AuthorData": {"56155078800": {"Name": "White S.", "AuthorID": "56155078800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, University College London"}, "57201737821": {"Name": "Hirst C.", "AuthorID": "57201737821", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57202717950": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57202717950", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
