It also includes items on Impulsive nonconformity assessing traits sensitive to borderline and antisocial personality. Recently, Mason et al. (2005) published a shortened 43-item version including all sub-dimensions. The aim of this study was to validate a French version of this short form and to study the relationships between its French- and English-speaking versions. O-LIFE short data was obtained from 1,048 students from two higher education institutions in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Results were compared with those from an English normative sample (n = 439). A series of confirmatory factor analyses showed acceptable configural and metric invariances across the two language versions. Moreover, results from the French data support the use of both four- and three-dimensional models of schizotypy and show expected correlations with other relevant self-report instruments. This French version of the O-LIFE short form is an appropriate tool to use in Frenchspeaking environments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["French translation", "Psychometric validation", "Schizotypy", "Self-report"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989953854", "SubjectAreas": [["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"]], "AuthorData": {"53982158100": {"Name": "Sierro G.", "AuthorID": "53982158100", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Lausanne"}, "7102912026": {"Name": "Rossier J.", "AuthorID": "7102912026", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Lausanne"}, "7102642087": {"Name": "Mohr C.", "AuthorID": "7102642087", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychology, University of Lausanne"}, "7004241930": {"Name": "Mason O.", "AuthorID": "7004241930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
