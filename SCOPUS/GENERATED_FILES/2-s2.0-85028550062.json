Understanding the evolution of lithium microstructures during battery operation is crucial for the development of an effective and safe rechargeable lithium-metal battery. This study employs both synchrotron and laboratory X-ray computed tomography to investigate the morphological evolution of the surface of metallic lithium electrodes during a single cell discharge and over numerous cycles, respectively. The formation of surface pits and the growth of mossy lithium deposits through the separator layer are characterised in three-dimensions. This has provided insight into the microstructural evolution of lithium-metal electrodes during rechargeable battery operation, and further understanding of the importance of separator architecture in mitigating lithium dendrite growth.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028550062", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55976146800": {"Name": "Taiwo O.O.", "AuthorID": "55976146800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab., Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56613490600": {"Name": "Finegan D.P.", "AuthorID": "56613490600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab., Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab., Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab., Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "8236915300": {"Name": "Hall S.A.", "AuthorID": "8236915300", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Division of Solid Mechanics, Lund University"}, "36998762700": {"Name": "Paz-Garcia J.M.", "AuthorID": "36998762700", "AffiliationID": "60003662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences, University of Malaga"}, "16309781600": {"Name": "Eastwood D.S.", "AuthorID": "16309781600", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "8504683300": {"Name": "Lee P.D.", "AuthorID": "8504683300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Materials, University of Manchester"}, "57064238500": {"Name": "Bodey A.J.", "AuthorID": "57064238500", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source"}, "57205077339": {"Name": "Rau C.", "AuthorID": "57205077339", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source"}}}
