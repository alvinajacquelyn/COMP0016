The grain growth activation energy was found to be 417 \u00b1 20 kJ mol\u2212 1 for the ZrO2, which increased with the addition of CNTs to 509 \u00b1 41 and 497 \u00b1 17 kJ mol\u2212 1 for the 0.5 and 2 vol% composites respectively. A sintering exponent of 2 was observed for the ZrO2, corresponding to normal grain growth, whilst the nanocomposites showed a CNT drag dominated sintering mechanism, with exponents of 2.7 and 3.2 for the 0.5 and 2 vol% composites respectively. This work confirms and quantifies the direct influence of CNTs on the grain growth mechanism and activation energy of ZrO2-CNT composites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon nanotubes", "Grain growth", "Nanocomposites", "Zirconia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon-nanotube composites", "Grain growth activation energy", "Grain growth mechanisms", "Growth behaviour", "High temperature", "Isothermal experiments", "Normal grain growth", "Sintering mechanism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026803527", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"55190620600": {"Name": "Milsom B.", "AuthorID": "55190620600", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "46761372500": {"Name": "Porwal H.", "AuthorID": "46761372500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "17347220500": {"Name": "Viola G.", "AuthorID": "17347220500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55331725300": {"Name": "Gao Z.", "AuthorID": "55331725300", "AffiliationID": "60069721, 60073595", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory of Shock Wave and Detonation Physics, Institute of Fluid Physics, China Academy of Engineering Physics"}, "7006407343": {"Name": "Reece M.", "AuthorID": "7006407343", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
