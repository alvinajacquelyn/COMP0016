The learning design support tool described here (the Learning Designer), resulting from an interdisciplinary research project in the UK, provides a new form of collaboration between teachers. This paper tests the value of the tool for cross-cultural sharing of learning designs. It documents the process of a Chinese teacher who tries to represent and share his language teaching planning by using this innovative web-based prototype. The paper reflects on the issues that arise from this cross-cultural study, and the implications for the future of pedagogical innovation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["course design", "course planning", "learning design", "Learning Designer", "pedagogical innovation", "pedagogical patterns collector"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057956317", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"57209885177": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57209885177", "AffiliationID": "60108700", "AffiliationName": "Foreign Language Department, Shanghai Open University"}, "6602915354": {"Name": "Laurillard D.", "AuthorID": "6602915354", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60117699", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, Institute of Education, University of London"}}}
