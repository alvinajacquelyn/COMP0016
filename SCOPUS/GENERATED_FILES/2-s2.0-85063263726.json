However, little is known about how publicly available websites address the risks of CHCs, particularly venous thromboembolism (VTE). Objective: The aim was to explore the information available to women about VTE and other risks of CHCs on websites available through commonly used search engines. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted to explore whether and how websites about CHCs in Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Slovakia, Spain, and the United Kingdom make reference to VTE and other CHC risks. A systematic search procedure was adopted across the six countries, based on relevant keywords. The search was carried out using the Google search engine by fluent/native speakers of each language. A content analysis approach was conducted to extract information from the selected websites. Results: A total of 357 websites were reviewed. Nearly all (343/357, 96.1%) the websites mentioned VTE as a risk of CHCs, with approximately half referring to other side effects as well. One-fifth (92/357, 25.8%) of the websites provided suggestions about the best contraceptive method to use, and only a minority (23/357, 6.4%) recommended women discuss CHCs with their health professionals. Sites were generally run by the media (110/357 30.8%) or medical services from nongovernmental organizations (140/357, 39.2%). Only a minority of websites referred to organizations such as the European Medicines Agency (11/357, 3.1%). Conclusions: Despite the large number of websites containing information about oral CHCs and their risks, particularly VTE, only a limited number referred to information from accredited health agency sources. We argue this is a missed opportunity for accredited health agencies to share high-quality information to assist women using CHCs to make informed decisions about contraception.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Content analysis", "Health information", "Information sources", "Internet", "Oral combined hormonal contraceptives", "Qualitative research", "Risks", "Venous thromboembolism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Contraceptives, Oral, Combined", "Europe", "Female", "Humans", "Information Seeking Behavior", "Internet", "Qualitative Research", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063263726", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57212704523": {"Name": "Alves P.G.", "AuthorID": "57212704523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EHealth Unit, Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "23009891600": {"Name": "Petersen I.", "AuthorID": "23009891600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
