The approach is based on regression modelling wherein goodness of fit is obtained from log\u2013log quantile regressions of the archaeologically inferred age versus a least-cost distance from the origin(s) of dispersal. The Fast Marching method is used to estimate the least-cost distances based on simple geographical features. We explicitly test three hypotheses for the arrival of japonica rice to India where, it has been proposed, it hybridized with the indigenous proto-indica, subsequently spreading again throughout India. Model selection, based on information criteria, highlights the role of the Inner Asia Mountain Corridor in introducing japonica rice into northeast India, followed closely by a \u2018mixed-route\u2019 model, where japonica was also almost simultaneously introduced via Assam, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Finally, we estimate the impact of future archaeological work on model selection, further strengthening the importance of the Inner Asia Mountain Corridor.", "AuthorKeywords": ["archaeobotany", "early agriculture", "hybridization", "India", "model selection", "South Asia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053201230", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"16246132100": {"Name": "Silva F.", "AuthorID": "16246132100", "AffiliationID": "60105000", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Humanities and Performing Arts, University of Wales Trinity Saint David"}, "36118300000": {"Name": "Weisskopf A.", "AuthorID": "36118300000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "36117767700": {"Name": "Castillo C.", "AuthorID": "36117767700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "55500340100": {"Name": "Murphy C.", "AuthorID": "55500340100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "36118119100": {"Name": "Kingwell-Banham E.", "AuthorID": "36118119100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "56844729800": {"Name": "Fuller D.", "AuthorID": "56844729800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "35960090700": {"Name": "Qin L.", "AuthorID": "35960090700", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Archaeology and Museology, Peking University"}}}
