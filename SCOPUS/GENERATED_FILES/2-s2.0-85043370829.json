Objective: To evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of prolonged generic glatiramer acetate (GTR) treatment and to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching from brand glatiramer acetate (GA) to GTR treatment. Methods: A total of 729 patients received GTR 20 mg/mL daily. Safety was assessed at months 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 and Expanded Disability Status Scale and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at months 12, 18, and 24. The presence of glatiramer anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) was tested at baseline and months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24. Results: The mean number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the GTR/GTR and GA/GTR groups was similar at months 12, 18, and 24. The change in other MRI parameters was also similar in the GTR/GTR and GA/GTR groups. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) did not differ between the GTR/GTR and GA/GTR groups, 0.21 and 0.24, respectively. The incidence, spectrum, and severity of reported adverse events did not differ between the GTR/GTR and GA/GTR groups. Glatiramer ADA titers were similar in the GTR/GTR and GA/GTR groups. Conclusion: Efficacy and safety of GTR is maintained over 2 years. Additionally, switching from GA to GTR is safe and well tolerated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical trial", "equivalence", "generic", "glatiramer acetate", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043370829", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7005132611": {"Name": "Selmaj K.", "AuthorID": "7005132611", "AffiliationID": "116123017", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Center Lodz"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology & Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}, "7005138294": {"Name": "Belova A.N.", "AuthorID": "7005138294", "AffiliationID": "60002799", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics, Functional Diagnostics, Nizhny Novgorod"}, "57202147513": {"Name": "Wolf C.", "AuthorID": "57202147513", "AffiliationID": "112914169", "AffiliationName": "Lycalis sprl"}, "6602952951": {"Name": "van den Tweel E.R.W.", "AuthorID": "6602952951", "AffiliationID": "60103357", "AffiliationName": "Synthon BV"}, "57197817077": {"Name": "Obery\u00e9 J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "57197817077", "AffiliationID": "60103357", "AffiliationName": "Synthon BV"}, "57007866100": {"Name": "Mulder R.", "AuthorID": "57007866100", "AffiliationID": "60103357", "AffiliationName": "Synthon BV"}, "56674425900": {"Name": "Egging D.F.", "AuthorID": "56674425900", "AffiliationID": "60103357", "AffiliationName": "Synthon BV"}, "6701390798": {"Name": "Koper N.P.", "AuthorID": "6701390798", "AffiliationID": "60103357", "AffiliationName": "Synthon BV"}, "35428277500": {"Name": "Cohen J.A.", "AuthorID": "35428277500", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Cleveland Clinic"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
