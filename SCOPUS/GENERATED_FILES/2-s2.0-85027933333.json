KGaA, Weinheim.The effect of grain size on electric field-induced strain in BaTiO3 ceramics was explored. The unipolar strain first increases and then decreases with increasing grain size with a peak of 0.28% around 4.5mm. Small grains have more recoverable non-1808 domains, but also more restriction from grain boundaries, while coarse grains have less restriction from grain boundaries, but less recoverable non-1808 domains. Thus, only ceramics with intermediate grain size can show large electric field-induced strain at electrical loading regime conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Domain switching", "Grain size", "Keywords BaTiO3", "Strain"], "IndexKeywords": ["Batio", "Coarse grains", "Domain switchings", "Electric-field-induced strain", "Electrical loading", "Grain size", "Small grains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027933333", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57207007644": {"Name": "Tan Y.", "AuthorID": "57207007644", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36007950700": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "36007950700", "AffiliationID": "60031031, 60127533", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, State Key Laboratory of Crystal Materials, Shandong University"}, "57205715827": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "57205715827", "AffiliationID": "60031031, 60127533", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, State Key Laboratory of Crystal Materials, Shandong University"}, "17347220500": {"Name": "Viola G.", "AuthorID": "17347220500", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7403395240": {"Name": "Yan H.", "AuthorID": "7403395240", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
