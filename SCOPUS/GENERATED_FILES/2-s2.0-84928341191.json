Cluster analysis was carried out in order to determine the ranges of indoor air pollutants, temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and ventilation rates at which the students were satisfied with the indoor environment. It was found that increased levels of particulate matter did not have a negative effect on students\u2019 perception while students seemed to link the degradation of IAQ with temperature variations. Statistically significant correlations were further found between measurement results and students\u2019 perception of the IEQ. Students\u2019 sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms and performance of schoolwork were also investigated as a function of the levels of indoor air pollutants and ventilation, and there were found significant positive correlations between particulate matter (PM) and certain health symptoms. Students\u2019 learning performance seemed to be affected by the ventilation rates and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations while certain health effects positively correlated to the levels of PM and CO2. The energy consumption of schools was rather low compared to other national findings, and both the electricity and oil consumption for heating positively correlated to the levels of indoor air pollutants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy", "IEQ", "Measurements", "Productivity", "Questionnaires", "Schools"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy", "Indoor air pollutants", "Indoor environmental quality", "Positive correlations", "Questionnaires", "Schools", "Sick building syndrome", "Temperature variation", "Air Pollution, Indoor", "Environmental Monitoring", "Greece", "Particulate Matter", "Schools", "Sick Building Syndrome", "Students", "Temperature", "Ventilation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928341191", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55762936400": {"Name": "Dorizas P.V.", "AuthorID": "55762936400", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Physics and Meteorology, University of Athens"}, "6507962457": {"Name": "Assimakopoulos M.N.", "AuthorID": "6507962457", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Physics and Meteorology, University of Athens"}, "7006575535": {"Name": "Santamouris M.", "AuthorID": "7006575535", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Physics and Meteorology, University of Athens"}}}
