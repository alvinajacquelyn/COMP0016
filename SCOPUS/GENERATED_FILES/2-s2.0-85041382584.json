The parents (mothers and fathers) of 47 (89% ascertainment) young children (1\u20137 years) with epilepsy in a defined geographical area of the UK completed the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales \u2013 Short Form (DASS-21), a screening measure for depression, anxiety, and stress. The responses of parents of children with epilepsy were compared with parents of developmental-, age-, and gender-matched children with nonepilepsy-related neurodisability (n = 48). Factors associated with parental symptoms were analyzed using regression. In the group with epilepsy, 47 mothers and 39 fathers completed the DASS-21. Seventy-two percent of mothers scored in the at-risk range on at least one DASS-21 subscale (Fathers 49%). Mothers of children with epilepsy were significantly more likely to score in the at risk range than fathers on depression (55% vs. 33%), anxiety (47% vs. 26%), and stress (55% vs. 31%) subscales (all p < 0.05). Mothers of children with epilepsy were also significantly more likely to score in the at-risk range than mothers of children with neurodisability on measures of depression (p = 0.005) and stress (p = 0.03). There was not a significant difference between fathers in both groups on any measures. In the group with epilepsy, increased child emotional\u2013behavioral difficulties were associated with increased DASS-21 scores on multivariable analysis (p = 0.04). Mothers of young children with epilepsy are at high risk for mental health difficulties, and all should be screened for such difficulties. There is a need to explore what parent and/or child focused interventions might be useful to reduce the mental health difficulties reported by mothers of young children with epilepsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Children", "Depression", "Epilepsy", "Parents", "Stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety", "Caregivers", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Depression", "Emotions", "Epilepsy", "Fathers", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Mental Health", "Mothers", "Parents", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Quality of Life", "Stress, Psychological", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041382584", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"26634364600": {"Name": "Reilly C.", "AuthorID": "26634364600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (ICH)"}, "57118580300": {"Name": "Jones C.", "AuthorID": "57118580300", "AffiliationID": "60112913", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Young Epilepsy"}, "23093844000": {"Name": "Dabydeen L.", "AuthorID": "23093844000", "AffiliationID": "60112913", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Young Epilepsy"}, "7101634220": {"Name": "Gillberg C.", "AuthorID": "7101634220", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.R.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health (ICH)"}, "7402223872": {"Name": "Das K.B.", "AuthorID": "7402223872", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60031576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological Sciences, University of Vermont College of Medicine"}, "23968672700": {"Name": "Atkinson P.", "AuthorID": "23968672700", "AffiliationID": "60011982", "AffiliationName": "Child Development Centre, Crawley Hospital"}, "57200498701": {"Name": "Memon A.", "AuthorID": "57200498701", "AffiliationID": "60011982", "AffiliationName": "Child Development Centre, Crawley Hospital"}}}
