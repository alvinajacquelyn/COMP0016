A subgroup of patients has a complicated disease course with high mortality. For these patients, investigation of more invasive, potentially curative treatments, such as allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), is warranted. Objective We sought to define the outcomes of HSCT for patients with CVID. Methods Retrospective data were collected from 14 centers worldwide on patients with CVID receiving HSCT between 1993 and 2012. Results Twenty-five patients with CVID, which was defined according to international criteria, aged 8 to 50 years at the time of transplantation were included in the study. The indication for HSCT was immunologic dysregulation in the majority of patients. The overall survival rate was 48%, and the survival rate for patients undergoing transplantation for lymphoma was 83%. The major causes of death were treatment-refractory graft-versus-host disease accompanied by poor immune reconstitution and infectious complications. Immunoglobulin substitution was stopped in 50% of surviving patients. In 92% of surviving patients, the condition constituting the indication for HSCT resolved. Conclusion This multicenter study demonstrated that HSCT in patients with CVID was beneficial in most surviving patients; however, there was a high mortality associated with the procedure. Therefore this therapeutic approach should only be considered in carefully selected patients in whom there has been extensive characterization of the immunologic and/or genetic defect underlying the CVID diagnosis. Criteria for patient selection, refinement of the transplantation protocol, and timing are needed for an improved outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Common variable immunodeficiency", "hematopoietic stem
