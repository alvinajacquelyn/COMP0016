The system is ground-based and uses a direct digital synthesizer to implement a frequency modulated continuous wave radar architecture. The system operates between 200 MHz to 400 MHz with a dc power consumption of 4.8 W. Since January 2014, three ApRES systems have been deployed on the ice shelf of Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica. One system is configured in monostatic point ranging mode, while two systems are configured in an orthogonal 8\u00d78 multiple input multiple output (MIMO) arrangement that enables two-dimensional through ice imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["glaciology", "ground penetrating radar", "ice shelves", "imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antarctic ice shelves", "Direct digital synthesizer", "Frequency modulated continuous wave radars", "glaciology", "Ground Penetrating Radar", "Ice shelves", "Pine island glaciers", "University College London"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961771281", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"]], "AuthorData": {"57198996462": {"Name": "Lok L.", "AuthorID": "57198996462", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35087329300": {"Name": "Brennan P.", "AuthorID": "35087329300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36185201600": {"Name": "Ash M.", "AuthorID": "36185201600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006627466": {"Name": "Nicholls K.", "AuthorID": "7006627466", "AffiliationID": "60025990", "AffiliationName": "British Antarctic Survey"}}}
