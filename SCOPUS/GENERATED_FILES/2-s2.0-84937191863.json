We studied QOL in patients with VTE and AF immediately after the start of anticoagulant therapy, and after three months of treatment. Furthermore we identified whether QOL was affected by age, gender and nationality. Materials and Methods The European pharmacogenetics of anticoagulant therapy (EU-PACT) study was a multicentre, randomized controlled trial of patients aged > 18 years diagnosed with VTE or AF. QOL was assessed using EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaires. Results The EQ-5D questionnaires were completed by 187 patients with VTE and 660 patients with AF. The QOL in patients diagnosed with VTE or AF was significantly impaired, however, during a 3 months treatment period, patients experienced an improvement (p < 0.05). The QOL in patients diagnosed with VTE improved with increasing age, with similar effects seen in men and women. Men and women diagnosed with AF differed in QOL (respectively 0.84 and 0.74, p < 0.05), and QOL decreased with age. Comparison between countries showed significant differences in the EQ-Index score at follow-up of patients with VTE, and in both EQ-Index score and EQ-VAS of patients with AF. Conclusions The QOL in patients with VTE and AF is strongly reduced directly after the start of anticoagulant treatment, but improves within 3 months. Moreover, QOL is influenced by demographic and disease-specific variables. These findings provide useful information for future cost-effectiveness studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age", "Atrial fibrillation", "Nationality", "Quality of life", "Venous thromboembolism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Anticoagulants", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Coumarins", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Venous Thromboembolism", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937191863", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"56724679000": {"Name": "Marvig C.L.", "AuthorID": "56724679000", "AffiliationID": "60013332, 60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Drug Design and Pharmacology, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen"}, "36093643600": {"Name": "Verhoef T.I.", "AuthorID": "36093643600", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht University"}, "56489803600": {"Name": "De Boer A.", "AuthorID": "56489803600", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht University"}, "7005167271": {"Name": "Bouvy M.", "AuthorID": "7005167271", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht University"}, "6602464879": {"Name": "Maitland-Van Der Zee A.H.", "AuthorID": "6602464879", "AffiliationID": "60070172, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht University"}, "7005410978": {"Name": "Kamali F.", "AuthorID": "7005410978", "AffiliationID": "60159968", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University Medical School"}, "7102328712": {"Name": "Daly A.K.", "AuthorID": "7102328712", "AffiliationID": "60159968", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University Medical School"}, "7003856662": {"Name": "Redekop K.", "AuthorID": "7003856662", "AffiliationID": "60022265", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, Erasmus University"}, "7006669713": {"Name": "Pirmohamed M.", "AuthorID": "7006669713", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Personalised Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool"}, "6603778712": {"Name": "Manolopoulos V.G.", "AuthorID": "6603778712", "AffiliationID": "60005613", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Pharmacology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School"}, "6603005522": {"Name": "Wadelius M.", "AuthorID": "6603005522", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Sciences, Clinical Pharmacology and Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University"}}}
