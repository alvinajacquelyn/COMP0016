Objectives: To determine whether the BRAIN test can measure disability in MS and identify the presence of pyramidal or cerebellar dysfunction. Methods: Kinesia scores (KS, number of key taps in 30 s), akinesia times (AT, mean dwell time on each key) and incoordination scores (IS, variance of travelling time between keys) were calculated in 39 MS patients. These were correlated against the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, pyramidal and cerebellar functional system scores and 9-hole peg test scores. Results: EDSS correlated with KS (r = \u2212 0.594, p < 0.001), AT (r = 0.464, p = 0.003) and IS (r = 0.423, p = 0.007). 9-HPT scores strongly correlated with KS (r = 0.926, p < 0.001). Pyramidal scores correlated with KS (r = \u2212 0.517, p < 0.001). Cerebellar scores correlated with KS (r = \u2212 0.665, p < 0.001), AT (r = 0.567, p < 0.001) and IS (r = 0.546, p = 0.007). Receiver operating characteristic curves demonstrate that KS can distinguish between the presence or absence of pyramidal and cerebellar dysfunction with area under curve 0.840 (p < 0.001) and 0.829 (p < 0.001), respectively. Conclusions: The BRAIN test can remotely measure disability in MS. Specific scores differ according to the presence and severity of pyramidal or extrapyramidal dysfunction. It demonstrates huge potential in monitoring disease progression in clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cerebellar dysfunction", "Keyboard", "Multiple sclerosis", "Online", "Pyramidal dysfunction", "Remote monitoring"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted", "Disability Evaluation", "Disabled Persons", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Psychomotor Performance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036498017", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55565966700": {"Name": "Shribman S.", "AuthorID": "55565966700", "AffiliationID": "60010426", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, St. George\u2019s Hospital"}, "57193267343": {"Name": "Hasan H.", "AuthorID": "57193267343", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "24438206900": {"Name": "Noyce A.J.", "AuthorID": "24438206900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Preventive Neurology Unit, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "50461640900": {"Name": "Hadavi S.", "AuthorID": "50461640900", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysiology, Kings College Hospital"}, "34770127900": {"Name": "Giovannoni G.", "AuthorID": "34770127900", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
