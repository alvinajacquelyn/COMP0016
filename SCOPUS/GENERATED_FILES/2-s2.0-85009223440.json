This study summarize management and policy lessons from the GEJE. The recovery efforts that followed the triple disasters: the earthquake, tsunami and meltdown of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant are in progress. The experience of the GEJE and tsunami prompted the building of embankments throughout the Pacific coastal side of the Tohoku region. The Cabinet's Reconstruction Headquarters used at least 19 trillion yen ($158 billion) for intensive reconstruction over five years through 2015. The local government of the affected area accelerated the decontamination of commercial land which is an important action for the recovery. The central government introduced the Electricity Business Act for implementing voluntary energy conservation measures for peak energy seasons. The GEJE has had an indirect effect on the health of the disaster victims via job uncertainty as well. Decontamination is crucial in bringing people and businesses back to the affected area and promoting sustainable economic recovery because it reduces uncertainty about the short and long-term health risks. An efficient health and occupation plan for the victims is essential for the integrated approach to multiple disaster management.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Disaster risk management", "Great East Japan earthquake", "Multiple disasters", "Nuclear radiation", "Tsunami"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009223440", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (miscellaneous)", "ECON", "2001"]], "AuthorData": {"13609873900": {"Name": "Managi S.", "AuthorID": "13609873900", "AffiliationID": "60189592, 60011019", "AffiliationName": "QUT Business School, Queensland University of Technology"}, "15839411900": {"Name": "Guan D.", "AuthorID": "15839411900", "AffiliationID": "60000112", "AffiliationName": "School of International Development, University of East Anglia"}}}
