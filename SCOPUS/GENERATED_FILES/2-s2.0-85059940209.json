Tumour overexpression of C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) appears predictive of skeletal involvement. We investigated the role of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and CXCR4 expression on CTCs as potential predictors of skeleton invasion. Methods: Blood from patients with metastatic bronchial, midgut or pancreatic NET (pNET) was analysed by CellSearch. CXCR4 immunohistochemistry was performed on matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. Results: Two hundred and fifty-four patients were recruited with 121 midgut and 119 pNETs, of which 51 and 36% had detectable CTCs, respectively. Bone metastases were reported in 30% of midgut and 23% of pNET patients and were significantly associated with CTC presence (p = 0.003 and p < 0.0001). In a subgroup of 40 patients, 85% patients with CTCs had CTCs positive for CXCR4 expression. The proportion of CXCR4-positive CTCs in patients with bone metastases was 56% compared to 35% in those without (p = 0.18) it. Staining for CXCR4 on matched FFPE tissue showed a trend towards a correlation with CXCR4 expression on CTCs (p = 0.08). Conclusions: CTC presence is associated with bone metastases in NETs. CXCR4 may be involved in CTC osteotropism and present a therapeutic target to reduce skeletal morbidity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Bone Neoplasms", "Female", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplastic Cells, Circulating", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Paraffin Embedding", "Receptors, CXCR4"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059940209", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56463146300": {"Name": "Rizzo F.M.", "AuthorID": "56463146300", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57191829024": {"Name": "Vesely C.", "AuthorID": "57191829024", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55904013800": {"Name": "Childs A.", "AuthorID": "55904013800", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57189630357": {"Name": "Ensell L.", "AuthorID": "57189630357", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "35080753100": {"Name": "Lowe H.", "AuthorID": "35080753100", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "6603079245": {"Name": "Thirlwell C.", "AuthorID": "6603079245", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Department of Oncology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35599970900": {"Name": "Hartley J.A.", "AuthorID": "35599970900", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "57199899475": {"Name": "Meyer T.", "AuthorID": "57199899475", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Department of Oncology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003959647": {"Name": "Marafioti T.", "AuthorID": "7003959647", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "55789555400": {"Name": "Akarca A.U.", "AuthorID": "55789555400", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}, "8378150500": {"Name": "Khan M.S.", "AuthorID": "8378150500", "AffiliationID": "60000020", "AffiliationName": "Wales Neuroendocrine Tumour Service, Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital of Wales"}, "55649892900": {"Name": "Mandair D.", "AuthorID": "55649892900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "16033469000": {"Name": "Toumpanakis C.", "AuthorID": "16033469000", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, ENETS Centre of Excellence, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54881593000": {"Name": "Cives M.", "AuthorID": "54881593000", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Bari \u201cA.
