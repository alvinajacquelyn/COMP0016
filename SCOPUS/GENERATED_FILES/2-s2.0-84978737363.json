{"Title": "Patterns of progression, treatment of progressive disease and post-progression survival in the New EPOC study", "Year": 2016, "Source": "Br. J. Cancer", "Volume": "115", "Issue": 4, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 420, "PageEnd": 424, "CitedBy": 6, "DOI": "10.1038/bjc.2016.208", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84978737363&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2016 Cancer Research UK.Background:The addition of cetuximab (CTX) to perioperative chemotherapy (CT) for operable colorectal liver metastases resulted in a shorter progression-free survival. Details of disease progression are described to further inform the primary study outcome.Methods:A total of 257 KRAS wild-type patients were randomised to CT alone or CT with CTX. Data regarding sites and treatment of progressive disease were obtained for the 109 (CT n=48, CT and CTX n=61) patients with progressive disease at the cut-off date for analysis of November 2012.Results:The liver was the most frequent site of progression (CT 67% (32/48); CT and CTX 66% (40/61)). A higher proportion of patients in the CT and group had multiple sites of progressive disease (CT 8%, 4/48; CT and CTX 23%, 14/61 P=0.04). Further treatment for progressive disease is known for 84 patients of whom 69 received further CT, most frequently irinotecan based. Twenty-two patients, 11 in each arm, received CTX as a further line agent.Conclusions:Both the distribution of progressive disease and further treatment are as expected for such a cohort. The pattern of disease progression seen is consistent with failure of systemic micrometastatic disease control rather than failure of local disease control following liver surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Camptothecin", "Capecitabine", "Cetuximab", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Disease Progression", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Hepatectomy", "Humans", "Leucovorin", "Liver Neoplasms", "Male", "Metastasectomy", "Middle Aged", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Organoplatinum Compounds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978737363", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"57202598932": {"Name": "Pugh S.A.", "AuthorID": "57202598932", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "University Surgery and Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital"}, "7005091532": {"Name": "Primrose J.N.", "AuthorID": "7005091532", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60021722", "AffiliationName": "University Surgery and Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital"}, "55851528600": {"Name": "Bowers M.", "AuthorID": "55851528600", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Clinical Trials Unit"}, "57206269406": {"Name": "Maishman T.", "AuthorID": "57206269406", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Clinical Trials Unit"}, "55787357500": {"Name": "Stanton L.", "AuthorID": "55787357500", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Clinical Trials Unit"}, "56091110500": {"Name": "Dixon E.", "AuthorID": "56091110500", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Clinical Trials Unit"}, "56007926200": {"Name": "Corkhill A.", "AuthorID": "56007926200", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Clinical Trials Unit"}, "57190250284": {"Name": "Radford M.", "AuthorID": "57190250284", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Clinical Trials Unit"}, "57190247730": {"Name": "Ball A.", "AuthorID": "57190247730", "AffiliationID": "60032889", "AffiliationName": "Royal Bournemouth Hospital"}, "57204301812": {"Name": "Falk S.", "AuthorID": "57204301812", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Cancer Institute, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15022203600": {"Name": "Finch-Jones M.", "AuthorID": "15022203600", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "Department of Upper Gastrointestinal Surgery, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101953217": {"Name": "Valle J.W.", "AuthorID": "7101953217", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60028784", "AffiliationName": "University of Manchester, Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55776257100": {"Name": "O'Reilly D.A.", "AuthorID": "55776257100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "7006352137": {"Name": "Siriwardena A.K.", "AuthorID": "7006352137", "AffiliationID": "60030886", "AffiliationName": "Hepatobiliary Unit, Manchester Royal Infirmary"}, "23989238300": {"Name": "Hornbuckle J.", "AuthorID": "23989238300", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Specialised Cancer Services, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7201512301": {"Name": "Rees M.", "AuthorID": "7201512301", "AffiliationID": "60170281", "AffiliationName": "Hepatobiliary Surgery, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8701527900": {"Name": "Rees C.", "AuthorID": "8701527900", "AffiliationID": "60170281", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200870006": {"Name": "Iveson T.", "AuthorID": "57200870006", "AffiliationID": "60000703", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003268270": {"Name": "Hickish T.", "AuthorID": "7003268270", "AffiliationID": "60026868", "AffiliationName": "Poole Hospital"}, "7006432342": {"Name": "Garden O.J.", "AuthorID": "7006432342", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Surgery, University of Edinburgh"}, "36071300500": {"Name": "Cunningham D.", "AuthorID": "36071300500", "AffiliationID": "60017166", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Gastrointestinal and Lymphoma Units, Royal Marsden Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004025232": {"Name": "Maughan T.S.", "AuthorID": "7004025232", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "7003634798": {"Name": "Bridgewater J.A.", "AuthorID": "7003634798", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}}}
