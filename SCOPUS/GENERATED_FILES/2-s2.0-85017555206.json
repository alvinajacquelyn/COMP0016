Addiction published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society for the Study of Addiction.Background and Aims: Life transitions such as retirement may influence alcohol consumption, but only a few studies have described this using longitudinal data. We identified patterns and predictors of risky drinking around the time of retirement. Design: A cohort study assessing trajectories and predictors of risky drinking among employees entering statutory retirement between 2000 and 2011. Setting and Participants: A total of 5805 men and women from the Finnish Public Sector study who responded to questions on alcohol consumption one to three times prior to (w\u22123, w\u22122, w\u22121), and one to three times after (w+1, w+2, w+3) retirement. Measurements: We assessed trajectories of risky drinking (> 24 units per week among men, > 16 units among women, or an extreme drinking occasion during past year) from pre- to post-retirement, as well as predictors of each alcohol consumption trajectory. Findings: Three trajectories were identified: sustained healthy drinking (81% of participants), temporary increase in risky drinking around retirement (12%) and slowly declining risky drinking after retirement (7%). The strongest pre-retirement predictors for belonging to the group of temporary increase in risky drinking were current smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 3.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.70\u20135.64], male sex (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 2.16\u20133.55), depression (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.05\u20131.99) and work-place in the metropolitan area (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.00\u20131.66). Compared with the slowly declining risky drinking group, the temporary increase in risky drinking group was characterized by lower occupational status and education, and work-place outside the metropolitan area. Conclusions: In Finland, approximately 12% of people who reach retirement age experience a temporary increase in alcohol consumption to risky levels, while approximately 7% experience a slow decline in risky levels of alcohol consumption. Male gender, smoking, being depressed and working in a metropolitan area are associated with increased likelihood of increased alcohol consumption.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ageing", "alcohol", "cohort", "retirement", "risky drinking", "trajectory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholism", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Finland", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Retirement", "Risk-Taking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017555206", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"24465136300": {"Name": "Halonen J.I.", "AuthorID": "24465136300", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "57193727946": {"Name": "Aalto V.", "AuthorID": "57193727946", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "6508300634": {"Name": "Lallukka T.", "AuthorID": "6508300634", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "35239241500": {"Name": "Virtanen M.", "AuthorID": "35239241500", "AffiliationID": "60010493", "AffiliationName": "Finnish Institute of Occupational Health"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London Medical School"}, "16308130100": {"Name": "Stenholm S.", "AuthorID": "16308130100", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "University of Tampere, Faculty of Social Sciences (Health Science)"}, "55925170900": {"Name": "Pulakka A.", "AuthorID": "55925170900", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "University of Turku, Department of Public Health, Turku University Hospital"}, "7003922524": {"Name": "Vahtera J.", "AuthorID": "7003922524", "AffiliationID": "60025765, 60006876", "AffiliationName": "University of Turku, Department of Public Health, Turku University Hospital"}, "7103096477": {"Name": "Kawachi I.", "AuthorID": "7103096477", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Harvard T.
