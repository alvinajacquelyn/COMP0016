We have developed an \u2018agent-based model\u2019 (ABM) that explores the impact of possible changes in regional infrastructure and in \u2018household agent\u2019 behaviour and lifestyles. We study households of the UK, Germany, Spain and Finland, and calculate the overall effects of the diffusion of such changes and innovations. The \u2018lifestyle\u2019 of households is divided into four different \u2018Domains\u2019\u2014Living, Food, Mobility and Energy. For each change, the model shows the linked effects of adoption, and total household input requirements (materials, energy etc.), household and food wastes and CO2 emissions. This informs policy concerning which modifications will be most effective. We can also estimate approximately how much \u2018clean\u2019 electricity will be needed in each country for household needs and their electric vehicles.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ABM model", "Clean electricity", "Household changes and innovations", "Household system", "Material footprints", "Sustainability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85086843420", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"7403501978": {"Name": "Allen P.", "AuthorID": "7403501978", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Cranfield University"}, "57190228597": {"Name": "Butans E.", "AuthorID": "57190228597", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Cranfield University"}, "57199096309": {"Name": "Robinson M.", "AuthorID": "57199096309", "AffiliationID": "60004407", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, Cranfield University"}, "15081806200": {"Name": "Varga L.", "AuthorID": "15081806200", "AffiliationID": "60176024", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, Chadwick Building"}}}
