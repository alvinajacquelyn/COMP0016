These compounds are generated within the vascular wall, at the level of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, as well as by adventitial fibroblasts. Physiologically, ROS generation is counteracted effectively by the rate of elimination. In hypertension, a ROS excess occurs, which is not counterbalanced by the endogenous antioxidant mechanisms, leading to a state of oxidative stress. Angiotensin II, the active peptide of the renin-angiotensin-system (RAS), is a significant stimulus for ROS generation within the vasculature. It was also documented that at the level of subfornical cerebral regions an inappropriate RAS stimulation may lead to an increased vascular sympathetic activity. More recently, in conditions of fetal undernutrition, it was also proposed an increased vascular sympathetic activity secondary to inappropriate RAS activation, leading to the development of hypertension in adult life. The present review will discuss the complex interaction between RAS activation, vascular ROS generation and increased sympathetic outflow in hypertension.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Angiotensin II", "Hypertension", "Reactive oxygen species", "Sympathetic nervous system"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angiotensin II", "Animals", "Blood Pressure", "Blood Vessels", "Brain", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Oxidative Stress", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Renin-Angiotensin System", "Risk Factors", "Signal Transduction", "Sympathetic Nervous System"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060769829", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57210724180": {"Name": "Masi S.", "AuthorID": "57210724180", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "7005719927": {"Name": "Virdis A.", "AuthorID": "7005719927", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa"}, "57205607666": {"Name": "Uliana M.", "AuthorID": "57205607666", "AffiliationID": "60082061", "AffiliationName": "Internal Medicine 4, University Hospital of Pisa"}}}
