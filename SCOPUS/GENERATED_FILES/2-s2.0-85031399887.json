Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Wroclaw, Poland.The current knowledge on tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is based mainly on the extensive work performed in murine models. Data obtained for human counterparts are generated on the basis of tumor analysis from patient samples. Both sources of information led to determination of the main suppressive mechanisms used by these cell subsets in tumor-bearing hosts. As a result of the identification of protein targets responsible for MDSCs suppressive activity, different therapeutics agents have been used to eliminate/reduce their adverse effect. In the present work, we review the current knowledge on suppressive mechanisms of MDSCs and therapeutic treatments that interfere with their differentiation, expansion or activity. Based on the accumulation of new evidences supporting their importance for tumor progression and metastasis, the interest in these cell types is increasing. We revise the methods of MDSC generation/differentiation ex vivo that may help in overcoming problems associated with limited numbers of cells available from animals and patients for their study.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Immunosuppression", "Immunotherapy", "Metastasis", "Myeloid regulatory cells", "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)", "Tumor progression"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Carcinogenesis", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Proliferation", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Immune Tolerance", "Immunotherapy", "Mice", "Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Neoplasms", "Tumor Escape", "Tumor Microenvironment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031399887", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"36632090300": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez-Vea M.", "AuthorID": "36632090300", "AffiliationID": "115933337", "AffiliationName": "Immunomodulation Group, Navarrabiomed Biomedical Research Center, Navarre Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA)"}, "57195282780": {"Name": "Zuazo M.", "AuthorID": "57195282780", "AffiliationID": "115933337", "AffiliationName": "Immunomodulation Group, Navarrabiomed Biomedical Research Center, Navarre Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA)"}, "6507354784": {"Name": "Gato M.", "AuthorID": "6507354784", "AffiliationID": "115933337", "AffiliationName": "Immunomodulation Group, Navarrabiomed Biomedical Research Center, Navarre Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA)"}, "6507259181": {"Name": "Escors D.", "AuthorID": "6507259181", "AffiliationID": "115933337", "AffiliationName": "Immunomodulation Group, Navarrabiomed Biomedical Research Center, Navarre Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA)"}, "26649509700": {"Name": "Kochan G.", "AuthorID": "26649509700", "AffiliationID": "115933337", "AffiliationName": "Immunomodulation Group, Navarrabiomed Biomedical Research Center, Navarre Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA)"}, "56907020800": {"Name": "Arasanz H.", "AuthorID": "56907020800", "AffiliationID": "110067888", "AffiliationName": "Hospital complex of Navarre, Navarre Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA)"}, "57195473563": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Hinojal G.", "AuthorID": "57195473563", "AffiliationID": "110067888", "AffiliationName": "Hospital complex of Navarre, Navarre Institute for Health Research (IdiSNA)"}}}
