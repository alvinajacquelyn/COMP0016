This is in contrast to the canonical devil's staircase, for example, occurring in the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions, where typically a single-body chemical potential is varied to scan through the plateaus. These systems, moreover, typically feature a particle-hole symmetry which trivially connects the hole part of the staircase (filling fraction f\u22651/2) to its particle part (f\u22641/2). Such symmetry is absent in our models and hence the particle sector and the hole sector can be separately controlled, resulting in exotic hybrid staircases.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["A-particles", "Devil's staircase", "Filling fractions", "Long range interactions", "One-dimensional Ising model", "Particle-hole symmetry", "State feature", "Two-body interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042152220", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"35198513700": {"Name": "Lan Z.", "AuthorID": "35198513700", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of Quantum Non-equilibrium Systems, University of Nottingham"}, "6507240638": {"Name": "Lesanovsky I.", "AuthorID": "6507240638", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of Quantum Non-equilibrium Systems, University of Nottingham"}, "57203332191": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57203332191", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Mathematics and Theoretical Physics of Quantum Non-equilibrium Systems, University of Nottingham"}}}
