Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. All rights reserved.Personalized external aortic root support (PEARS) is an emerging technology. It is a pre-emptive operation to halt aortic root expansion and maintain aortic valve function in Marfan syndrome and is also applicable to aortic root aneurysms of other aetiologies. To fully evaluate PEARS, awareness of all those who advise these patients is necessary to ensure that patients are fully informed of the alternative operations, to carefully build experience, to ensure safety and quality and to monitor outcomes. Herein, we present a summary of published methods and outcomes and the arrangements in place for fuller evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aortic root aneurysm", "Marfan syndrome", "Personalized external aortic root support"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aorta", "Aortic Aneurysm", "Blood Vessel Prosthesis", "Computer-Aided Design", "Humans", "Marfan Syndrome", "Prosthesis Design", "Surgical Mesh", "Technology Assessment, Biomedical"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991030753", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57196678944": {"Name": "Treasure T.", "AuthorID": "57196678944", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Operational Research Unit, University College London"}, "7102903975": {"Name": "Petrou M.", "AuthorID": "7102903975", "AffiliationID": "60008323", "AffiliationName": "John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "6701357474": {"Name": "Rosendahl U.", "AuthorID": "6701357474", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7102974417": {"Name": "Pepper J.", "AuthorID": "7102974417", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Unit, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7201681473": {"Name": "Austin C.", "AuthorID": "7201681473", "AffiliationID": "60004111", "AffiliationName": "St Thomas' Hospital"}, "6602268848": {"Name": "Rega F.", "AuthorID": "6602268848", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Leuven University Hospital"}, "7003322750": {"Name": "Pirk J.", "AuthorID": "7003322750", "AffiliationID": "60020529", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine"}}}
