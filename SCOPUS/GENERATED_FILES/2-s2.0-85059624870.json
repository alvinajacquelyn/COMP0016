Detailed studies of phenotype and genotype are necessary to improve diagnosis and elucidate this disorder pathogenesis. OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To investigate the clinical phenotype, retinal architecture, neuroimaging features and genetic profile of Brazilian patients with ARSACS, we performed neurological and ophthalmological evaluation in thirteen Brazilian patients with molecularly confirmed ARSACS, and examined their mutation profiles. Optical coherence tomography protocol (OCT) consisted in peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurement and qualitative analysis of perifoveal scans. Neuroimaging protocol accessed the frequency of atrophy in cerebellum, corpus callosum and parietal lobe, brainstem signal abnormalities, and posterior fossa arachnoid cysts. We reviewed the literature to delineate the ARSACS phenotype in the largest series worldwide. RESULTS: All patients had ataxia and spasticity, and 11/13 had peripheral neuropathy. Macular microcysts were present in two patients. Peripapillary striations, dentate appearance of inner retina and papillomacular fold were found in eleven cases. All individuals exhibited thickening of RNFL in OCT. The most frequent radiological signs were cerebellar atrophy (13/13), biparietal atrophy (12/13), and linear pontine hypointensities (13/13). Genetic analysis revealed 14 different SACS variants, of which two are novel. CONCLUSION: Macular microcysts, inner retina dentate appearance and papillomacular fold are novel retinal imaging signs of ARSACS. Ophthalmological and neuroimaging changes are common findings in Brazilian patients. The core clinical features of ARSACS are ataxia, spasticity and peripheral neuropathy with onset predominantly in the first decade of life.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ataxia", "Autosomal recessive ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay", "MRI", "Optical coherence tomography", "Retina"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brazil", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle Spasticity", "Neuroimaging", "Retinal Neurons", "Sequence Analysis, DNA", "Spinocerebellar Ataxias", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059624870", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56394619200": {"Name": "Rezende Filho F.M.", "AuthorID": "56394619200", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Neurology and Ataxia Unit, Department of Neurology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "25936663300": {"Name": "Pedroso J.L.", "AuthorID": "25936663300", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Neurology and Ataxia Unit, Department of Neurology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "55879071800": {"Name": "Barsottini O.G.P.", "AuthorID": "55879071800", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Division of General Neurology and Ataxia Unit, Department of Neurology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "55443104800": {"Name": "Parkinson M.H.", "AuthorID": "55443104800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Movement and Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology London"}, "6603845190": {"Name": "Giunti P.", "AuthorID": "6603845190", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Movement and Clinical Neurosciences, UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology London"}, "57184044500": {"Name": "Poh R.", "AuthorID": "57184044500", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Neurogenetics, NHNN, UCLH Queen Square London"}, "56105087200": {"Name": "Faber I.", "AuthorID": "56105087200", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Universidade Estadual de Campinas"}, "8962997000": {"Name": "Fran\u00e7a Junior M.C.", "AuthorID": "8962997000", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Universidade Estadual de Campinas"}, "22934659700": {"Name": "Louren\u00e7o C.M.", "AuthorID": "22934659700", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, School of Medicine"}, "35254125400": {"Name": "J\u00fanior W.M.", "AuthorID": "35254125400", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, School of Medicine"}, "7102969701": {"Name": "Kok F.", "AuthorID": "7102969701", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, School of Medicine"}, "14632425300": {"Name": "Sallum J.M.F.", "AuthorID": "14632425300", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo"}}}
