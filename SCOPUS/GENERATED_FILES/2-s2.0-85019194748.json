A diverse range of neuroscientific techniques are now available that allow researchers to observe the brain\u2019s responses to different types of speech stimuli in both healthy and impaired listeners, and also to observe how individuals\u2019 abilities to process speech change as a consequence of disrupting processing in specific brain regions. This special issue provides a tutorial review of the most important of these methods to guide researchers to make informed choices about which methods are best suited to addressing specific questions concerning the neuro-computational foundations of spoken language understanding. This introductory review provides (i) an historical overview of the experimental study of spoken language understanding, (ii) a summary of the key method currently being used by cognitive neuroscientists in this field, and (iii) thoughts on the likely future developments of these methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain stimulation", "cognitive neuroscience", "neuroimaging", "speech", "Spoken language"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019194748", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"6701635982": {"Name": "Rodd J.M.", "AuthorID": "6701635982", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London"}, "57219322603": {"Name": "Davis M.H.", "AuthorID": "57219322603", "AffiliationID": "60029069", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit"}}}
