Here, we develop a method for computing the thermodynamic contribution to catalysis due to NAC formation in bimolecular reactions, within the limit of a classical molecular dynamics force field. We make use of the B\u00fcrgi-Dunitz theory applied to large-scale unbiased all-atom ensemble molecular dynamics simulations. We apply this to HIV-1 protease peptide hydrolysis, known to achieve a rate enhancement of \u223c1011 (\u03b4Gcat 15 kcal/mol) over the uncatalyzed bimolecular reaction (\u03b4Gnon 30 kcal/mol). The ground state consists of a nucleophilic water molecule bound to an octapeptide substrate in the active site. We first observe multiple and reversible binding of a nucleophilic water molecule into the active site giving a free energy of binding of \u03b4G = -1 kcal/mol to form the GS. The free energy barriers for catalyzed and uncatalyzed NAC formation are both equivalent: \u03b4GNAC =4.6 kcal/mol, constituting 30% and 15% of the overall barriers, respectively. Therefore, not only does adoption of NACs only account for minor progress along the transition path in both catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions, but there is no preferential formation of them in the catalyzed reaction. Analysis of the catalytic hydrogen bond network reveals interactions that stabilize the GS; however, subsequent NAC formation does not preferentially favor any of the possible hydrogen bond configurations. This supports the view that the catalytic power of HIV-1 protease is not due to NAC formation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biocatalysis", "HIV Protease", "Hydrolysis", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Protein Conformation", "Thermodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921419225", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"15045573500": {"Name": "Sadiq S.", "AuthorID": "15045573500", "AffiliationID": "60032942, 60101751", "AffiliationName": "Infection Biology Unit, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona Biomedical Research Park (PRBB)"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
