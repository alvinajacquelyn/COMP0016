The EGFR is frequently overexpressed or mutated in various cancers leading to aberrant signaling and tumor growth. Hence, identification of interaction partners that bind to mutated EGFR can help identify novel targets for drug discovery. Here, we used a systematic approach to identify novel proteins that are involved in cancerous EGFR signaling. Using a combination of high-content imaging and a mammalian membrane two-hybrid protein\u2013protein interaction method, we identified eight novel interaction partners of EGFR, of which half strongly interacted with oncogenic, hyperactive EGFR variants. One of these, transforming acidic coiled-coil proteins (TACC) 3, stabilizes EGFR on the cell surface, which results in an increase in downstream signaling via the mitogen-activated protein kinase and AKT pathway. Depletion of TACC3 from cells using small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown or small-molecule targeting reduced mitogenic signaling in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, suggesting that targeting TACC3 has potential as a new therapeutic approach for non-small cell lung cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["EGFR", "non-small cell lung cancer", "oncogenic signaling", "protein\u2013protein interaction", "two-hybrid screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Cell Survival", "Computational Biology", "Gene Deletion", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "HEK293 Cells", "HeLa Cells", "Humans", "Immunoprecipitation", "Microtubule-Associated Proteins", "Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor", "RNA, Small Interfering", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008324006", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"8644154600": {"Name": "Petschnigg J.", "AuthorID": "8644154600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "57192832221": {"Name": "Blair L.", "AuthorID": "57192832221", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "6603482374": {"Name": "Ketteler R.", "AuthorID": "6603482374", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "12546091800": {"Name": "Kotlyar M.", "AuthorID": "12546091800", "AffiliationID": "60008768, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Princess Margaret Cancer Center, University Health Network"}, "7003966366": {"Name": "Jurisica I.", "AuthorID": "7003966366", "AffiliationID": "60117382", "AffiliationName": "TECHNA Institute for the Advancement of Technology for Health"}, "7003416997": {"Name": "Stagljar I.", "AuthorID": "7003416997", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Toronto"}}}
