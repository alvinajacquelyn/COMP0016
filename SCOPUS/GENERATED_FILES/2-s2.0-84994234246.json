This work addresses this integration problem and proposes a comprehensive solution approach, as well as guidelines for Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) tools managing the corresponding cyberinfrastructure. This study presents a methodology based on a domain ontology which is used as the connector between the introduced data, the different available formulations developed to solve the decision-making problem, and the necessary information to build the finally required problem instance. The methodology has demonstrated its capability to help exploiting different available decision-making problem formulations in complex cases, leading to new applications and/or extensions of these available formulations in a robust and flexible way.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Batch Control", "Knowledge and Information Management", "Mathematical Modelling", "Ontologies", "Scheduling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994234246", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"56811631900": {"Name": "Dombayci C.", "AuthorID": "56811631900", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Department, ETSEIB, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"}, "57202379120": {"Name": "Medina S.", "AuthorID": "57202379120", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Department, ETSEIB, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"}, "56866527000": {"Name": "Espu\u00f1a A.", "AuthorID": "56866527000", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Department, ETSEIB, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"}, "6701703637": {"Name": "Graells M.", "AuthorID": "6701703637", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Engineering Department, EUETIB, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya"}}}
