However, in many LMICs, infectious diseases are still prevalent resulting in a \"double burden\" of disease. With increased life expectancy and longevity with HIV, older adults may particularly be at risk of this double burden. Here we describe the relative contributions of infections and NCDs to hospital admissions and mortality, according to age, in Malawi's largest hospital. Methods Primary diagnosis on discharge/death, mortality rates, and HIV status were recorded prospectively on consecutive adult medical in-patients over 2 years using an electronic medical records system. Diagnoses were classified as infections or NCDs and analysed according to age and gender. Findings 10,191 records were analysed. Overall, infectious diseases, particularly those associated with HIV, were the leading cause of admission. However, in adults \u226555 years, NCDs were the commonest diagnoses. In adults <55 years 71% of deaths were due to infections whereas in adults \u226555 years 56% of deaths were due to NCDs. Interpretation Infectious diseases are still the leading cause of adult admission to a central hospital in Malawi but in adults aged \u226555 years NCDs are the most frequent diagnoses. HIV was an underlying factor in the majority of adults with infections and was also present in 53% of those with NCDs. These findings highlight the need for further health sector shifts to address the double burden of infectious and NCDs, particularly in the ageing population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging", "Communicable Diseases", "Electronic Health Records", "HIV Infections", "Hospital Mortality", "Hospitalization", "Humans", "Life Expectancy", "Malawi", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009973268", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7004261268": {"Name": "Allain T.J.", "AuthorID": "7004261268", "AffiliationID": "60170515", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Bristol NHS Trust"}, "54883724000": {"Name": "Aston S.", "AuthorID": "54883724000", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "57193012426": {"Name": "Mapurisa G.", "AuthorID": "57193012426", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "57193006246": {"Name": "Ganiza T.N.", "AuthorID": "57193006246", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "35300534900": {"Name": "Peterson I.", "AuthorID": "35300534900", "AffiliationID": "60072678", "AffiliationName": "Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme"}, "36501286400": {"Name": "Banda N.P.", "AuthorID": "36501286400", "AffiliationID": "60072664, 60072660", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, University of Malawi"}, "55632898300": {"Name": "Sakala S.", "AuthorID": "55632898300", "AffiliationID": "60072679, 60072668", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "37006759300": {"Name": "Gonani A.", "AuthorID": "37006759300", "AffiliationID": "60072679, 60072668", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Health, Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "7005251165": {"Name": "Heyderman R.S.", "AuthorID": "7005251165", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
