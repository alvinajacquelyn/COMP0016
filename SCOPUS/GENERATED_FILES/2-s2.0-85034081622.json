The semantics of a while-loop is defined as the limit of iteratively applying a functional to a zero-element just as in the traditional weakest pre-expectation calculus, even though a standard least fixed point argument is not applicable in our semantics. A striking feature of our semantics is that it is always well-defined, even if the expected values do not exist. We show that the calculus is sound and allows for compositional reasoning. Furthermore, we present an invariant-based approach for reasoning about pre-expectations of loops.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Compositional reasoning", "Expected values", "Fixed point argument", "Probabilistic programs", "Weakest precondition", "While loops"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034081622", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"47962346900": {"Name": "Kaminski B.", "AuthorID": "47962346900", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Software Modeling and Verification Group, RWTH Aachen University"}, "7003679176": {"Name": "Katoen J.", "AuthorID": "7003679176", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Software Modeling and Verification Group, RWTH Aachen University"}}}
