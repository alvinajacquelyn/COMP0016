The increase in valence band offset with increasing x is attributed to the corresponding increase in spontaneous polarization of the wurtzite structure. The ScxGa1-xN/AlN heterojunction is type I, similar to other III-nitride-based heterojunctions. The data also indicate that a type II staggered heterojunction, which can enhance spatial charge separation, could be formed if ScxGa1-xN is grown on GaN.", "AuthorKeywords": ["heterojunction", "ScGaN", "valence band offset", "x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge separations", "III-Nitride", "ScGaN", "Spontaneous polarizations", "Type II", "Valence band offsets", "Wurtzite structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978194085", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"54397718300": {"Name": "Tsui H.", "AuthorID": "54397718300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "56577813800": {"Name": "Goff L.", "AuthorID": "56577813800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "8911778000": {"Name": "Moram M.", "AuthorID": "8911778000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "7005719934": {"Name": "Beere H.", "AuthorID": "7005719934", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "8546355000": {"Name": "Farrer I.", "AuthorID": "8546355000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "36050490200": {"Name": "Ritchie D.", "AuthorID": "36050490200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
