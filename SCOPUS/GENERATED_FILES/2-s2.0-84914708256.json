All rights reserved.We propose an energy relaxation mechanism whereby strongly correlated spin systems decay into their ground states. The relaxation is driven by cavity quantum electrodynamics interaction and the decay of cavity photons. It is shown that by applying broadband driving fields, strongly correlated systems can be cooled regardless of the specific details of their energy level profiles. The scheme would also have significant implications in other contexts, such as adiabatic quantum computation and steady-state entanglement in dissipative systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cavity cooling", "Quantum simulation", "Strongly correlated systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adiabatic quantum computation", "Cavity cooling", "Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics", "Dissipative systems", "Energy relaxation mechanisms", "Quantum simulations", "Strongly correlated spin systems", "Strongly correlated systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84914708256", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"24773292500": {"Name": "Cho J.", "AuthorID": "24773292500", "AffiliationID": "60009851", "AffiliationName": "School of Computational Sciences, Korea Institute for Advanced Study"}, "36067105100": {"Name": "Kim M.S.", "AuthorID": "36067105100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "QOLS, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "7401626610": {"Name": "Bose S.", "AuthorID": "7401626610", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
