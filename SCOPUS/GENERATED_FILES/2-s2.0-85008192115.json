But if we do not have access to this amount of work, can the transition happen probabilistically? In the thermodynamic limit, this probability tends to zero, but here we find that for finite-sized and quantum systems it can be finite. We compute the maximum probability of a transition or a thermodynamical fluctuation from any initial state to any final state and show that this maximum can be achieved for any final state that is block diagonal in the energy eigenbasis. We also find upper and lower bounds on this transition probability, in terms of the work of transition. As a by-product, we introduce a finite set of thermodynamical monotones related to the thermomajorization criteria which governs state transitions and compute the work of transition in terms of them. The trade-off between the probability of a transition and any partial work added to aid in that transition is also considered. Our results have applications in entanglement theory, and we find the amount of entanglement required (or gained) when transforming one pure entangled state into any other.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Quantum information", "Quantum physics", "Statistical physics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Maximum probability", "Quantum Information", "Quantum physics", "Second Law of Thermodynamics", "Statistical physics", "Thermodynamic limits", "Transition probabilities", "Upper and lower bounds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008192115", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56104744100": {"Name": "Alhambra \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "56104744100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7102137778": {"Name": "Oppenheim J.", "AuthorID": "7102137778", "AffiliationID": "60095887, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Centre for Quantum Technologies, National University of Singapore"}, "56102945500": {"Name": "Perry C.", "AuthorID": "56102945500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
