The effects of curing conditions and time, alkali activator/clay and alkali activator molarity, and VA/clay ratio are determined. The compressive strength of the untreated clayey soil specimens could be increased from 0.2 to 4 MPa and 2 to 12 MPa at the OC and DC conditions, respectively, when the soil partially replaced by 15 wt% of the binders. It is observed that geopolymer treatment is more efficient at the dry conditions (DC) while the Portland cement is superb at the wet environments (OC). This difference is associated with the role of water and pH in the kinetics of geopolymerization and the Portland cement hydration. Moreover, increasing the molarity of alkali activator and alkali activator/clay improve the compressive strength of the geopolymer treated soil. Besides, the higher energy absorption in all geopolymer specimens shows the superior ductility of this material in comparison with OPC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cement", "Clay", "Geopolymer", "Natural pozzolan", "Soil stabilization", "Volcanic ash"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alkali activators", "Geopolymer", "Geopolymerization", "Mechanical performance", "Natural pozzolan", "Ordinary Portland cement", "Soil stabilization", "Volcanic ash"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052115717", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57196117498": {"Name": "Ghadir P.", "AuthorID": "57196117498", "AffiliationID": "60012835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology"}, "55484588000": {"Name": "Ranjbar N.", "AuthorID": "55484588000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced and Innovative Materials (AIM) Group, Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
