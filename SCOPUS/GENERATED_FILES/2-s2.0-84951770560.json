As reference standard quality impacts the likelihood of detecting significant improvements (i.e. the statistical power), we derived a sample size formula for segmentation accuracy comparison using an imperfect reference standard. We expressed this formula as a function of algorithm performance and reference standard quality (e.g. measured with a high quality reference standard on pilot data) to reveal the relationship between reference standard quality and statistical power, addressing key study design questions: (1) How many validation images are needed to compare segmentation algorithms? (2) How accurate should the reference standard be? The resulting formula predicted statistical power to within 2% of Monte Carlo simulations across a range of model parameters. A case study, using the PROMISE12 prostate segmentation data set, shows the practical use of the formula.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Reference standard", "Segmentation accuracy", "Statistical power"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithm performance", "Model parameters", "Prostate segmentation", "Quality impact", "Reference standard", "Segmentation accuracy", "Segmentation algorithms", "Statistical power"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951770560", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36026807300": {"Name": "Gibson E.", "AuthorID": "36026807300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35509884100": {"Name": "Huisman H.", "AuthorID": "35509884100", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Radboud University Medical Center"}, "7005201740": {"Name": "Barratt D.", "AuthorID": "7005201740", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
