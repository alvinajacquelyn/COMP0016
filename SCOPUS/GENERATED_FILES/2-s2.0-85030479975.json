Lab-scale X-ray micro-tomography was performed on an elemental sulfur electrode and a miniaturized in-situ tomography Li-S cell, and the 3D visualization achieved with this technique provides a wealth of information, improving understanding of the evolution of morphological and microstructural parameters of the different phases. As X-ray imaging is inherently non-destructive, it enables these parameters to be observed in-situ as a function of cycle life and state of charge. The inherently anisotropic nature of active material dissolution, recrystallization and other degradation processes within the electrode necessitates a three-dimensional approach to enable their visualization and quantification, and X-ray tomography is a useful tool in informing the development of more optimal electrode designs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Degradation process", "Gravimetric energy densities", "Micro-structural characteristics", "Microstructural parameters", "Optimal electrodes", "Technical challenges", "Wealth of information", "X-ray micro tomographies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030479975", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"57191663553": {"Name": "Tan C.", "AuthorID": "57191663553", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57191666829": {"Name": "Daemi S.", "AuthorID": "57191666829", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
