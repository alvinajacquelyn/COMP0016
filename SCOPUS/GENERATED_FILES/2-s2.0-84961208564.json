We used power functions and geometric principles to explore allometric relationships of both morphological and foraging characteristics of mammalian herbivores in the South African savannah, covering a body size range of more than three orders magnitude. Our results show that, although intradental mouth volume scaled to a power slightly less than one to body mass, actual bite volume, as measured in the field, scaled to body mass with a factor closer to 1.75. However, when including the volume added to intradental mouth volume by soft mouth parts, such as tongue and lips (or trunks in elephant), mouth volume scaled linearly with actual bite volume and in a similar fashion as actual bite volume to body size. Bite mass and bite leaf mass scaled linearly with body size. We conclude that these scaling relationships indicate that large herbivores use their enlarged soft mouth parts to not only increase bite volume and thereby bite mass, but also select soft plant parts and thereby increase the leaf mass fraction per bite.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Allometry", "Bite mass", "Feeding station", "Instantaneous intake"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961208564", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36669157800": {"Name": "Pretorius Y.", "AuthorID": "36669157800", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "7202844050": {"Name": "de Boer W.F.", "AuthorID": "7202844050", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "55480102700": {"Name": "Kortekaas K.", "AuthorID": "55480102700", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "56524399300": {"Name": "van Wijngaarden M.", "AuthorID": "56524399300", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "26432701300": {"Name": "Kohi E.M.", "AuthorID": "26432701300", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "15729888000": {"Name": "Mwakiwa E.", "AuthorID": "15729888000", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "7103333259": {"Name": "Prins H.H.T.", "AuthorID": "7103333259", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Resource Ecology Group, Wageningen University"}, "8886277100": {"Name": "Grant R.C.", "AuthorID": "8886277100", "AffiliationID": "60009183, 60016298", "AffiliationName": "Scientific Services, Kruger National Park"}, "7004596566": {"Name": "Slotow R.", "AuthorID": "7004596566", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Biological and Conservation Sciences, Westville Campus, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}}}
