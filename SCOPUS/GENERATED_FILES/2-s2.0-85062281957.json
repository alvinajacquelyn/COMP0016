Alternative graft manipulation strategies have been used over the last 11 years to reduce these risks. Objective: We investigated the outcome of using different graft manipulation strategies among children with primary immunodeficiencies. Methods: Between 2006 and 2017, 147 patients with primary immunodeficiencies received 155 mismatched grafts: 30 T-cell receptor (TCR) \u03b1\u03b2/CD19\u2013depleted grafts, 43 cord blood (CB) grafts (72% with no serotherapy), 17 CD34+ selection with T-cell add-back grafts, and 65 unmanipulated grafts. Results: The estimated 8-year survival of the entire cohort was 79%, transplant-related mortality was 21.7%, and the graft failure rate was 6.7%. Posttransplantation viral reactivation, grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD), and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) complicated 49.6%, 35%, and 15% of transplantations, respectively. Use of TCR\u03b1\u03b2/CD19 depletion was associated with a significantly lower incidence of grade II to IV aGvHD (11.5%) and cGvHD (0%), although with a greater incidence of viral reactivation (70%) in comparison with other grafts. T-cell immune reconstitution was robust among CB transplants, although with a high incidence (56.7%) of grade II to IV aGvHD. Stable full donor engraftment was significantly greater at 80% among TCR\u03b1\u03b2+/CD19+-depleted and CB transplants versus 40% to 60% among the other groups. Conclusions: Rapidly accessible CB and haploidentical grafts are suitable alternatives for patients with no HLA-matched donor. Cord transplantation without serotherapy and TCR\u03b1\u03b2+/CD19+-depleted grafts produced comparable survival rates of around 80%, although with a high rate of aGvHD with the former and a high risk of viral reactivation with the latter that need to be addressed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cord", "graft-versus-host disease", "immune reconstitution", "Mismatched stem cell transplantation", "T-cell receptor \u03b1\u03b2/CD19"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062281957", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"55645792800": {"Name": "Elfeky R.", "AuthorID": "55645792800", "AffiliationID": "60016618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Allergy and Immunology, Ain Shams University"}, "6602889677": {"Name": "Amrolia P.", "AuthorID": "6602889677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "11739326500": {"Name": "Qasim W.", "AuthorID": "11739326500", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Molecular and Cellular Immunology Unit, University College London (UCL) Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57203102921": {"Name": "Veys P.", "AuthorID": "57203102921", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57194216761": {"Name": "Shah R.M.", "AuthorID": "57194216761", "AffiliationID": "60000115", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Oncology and BMT, Alberta Children's Hospital"}, "8346971800": {"Name": "Rao K.", "AuthorID": "8346971800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "55362669500": {"Name": "Chiesa R.", "AuthorID": "55362669500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "12786401200": {"Name": "Worth A.", "AuthorID": "12786401200", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7006078464": {"Name": "Gilmour K.", "AuthorID": "7006078464", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7402058288": {"Name": "Adams S.", "AuthorID": "7402058288", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "19333409100": {"Name": "Ahsan G.", "AuthorID": "19333409100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57201471128": {"Name": "Unni M.N.M.", "AuthorID": "57201471128", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Host Defence Unit, Great North Children's Hospital"}, "7005277422": {"Name": "Flood T.", "AuthorID": "7005277422", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Host Defence Unit, Great North Children's Hospital"}, "55880862200": {"Name": "Abinun M.", "AuthorID": "55880862200", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Host Defence Unit, Great North Children's Hospital"}, "6701543518": {"Name": "Hambleton S.", "AuthorID": "6701543518", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Host Defence Unit, Great North Children's Hospital"}, "7006244214": {"Name": "Cant A.J.", "AuthorID": "7006244214", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Host Defence Unit, Great North Children's Hospital"}, "6602385570": {"Name": "Barge D.", "AuthorID": "6602385570", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Host Defence Unit, Great North Children's Hospital"}, "57202369449": {"Name": "Gennery A.R.", "AuthorID": "57202369449", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Host Defence Unit, Great North Children's Hospital"}, "6507443729": {"Name": "Slatter M.", "AuthorID": "6507443729", "AffiliationID": "112928806", "AffiliationName": "Host Defence Unit, Great North Children's Hospital"}, "56549688800": {"Name": "Ottaviano G.", "AuthorID": "56549688800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Fondazione MBBM University of Milan-Bicocca"}}}
