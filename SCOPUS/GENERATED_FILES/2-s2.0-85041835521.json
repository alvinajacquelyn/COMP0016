Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.To develop and pretest an European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Sexual Health Questionnaire (EORTC SHQ-22) for the assessment of physical, psychological, and social aspects of sexual health (SH) in male and female cancer patients and survivors. Questionnaire construction started with creating a list of relevant SH issues based on a comprehensive literature review. Issues were subsequently evaluated for relevance and prioritization by 78 healthcare professionals (HCP) and 107 patients from 12 countries during in-depth interviews (phase 1). Extracted issues were operationalized into items (phase 2). Phase 3 focused on pretesting the preliminary questionnaire in a cross-cultural patient sample (n = 171) using debriefing interviews. Psychometric properties were preliminary determined using a principal component analysis and Cronbach's alpha. We derived 53 relevant SH issues from the literature. Based on HCP and patient interviews, 22 of these 53 issues were selected and operationalized into items. Testing the preliminary 22-item short questionnaire resulted in a change of wording in five items and two communication-related items; no items were removed. Preliminary psychometric analysis revealed a two-factor solution and 11 single items; both scales showed good reliability indicated by a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87 (sexual satisfaction) and 0.82 (sexual pain). Cross-cultural pretesting of the preliminary EORTC SH questionnaire has indicated excellent applicability, patient acceptance, and comprehensiveness as well as good psychometric properties. The final development phase, that is psychometric validation (phase four) including large-scale, cross-cultural field testing of the EORTC SHQ-22, has commenced.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "patient-reported outcomes", "quality of life", "sexual health", "survivor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Psychometrics", "Quality of Life", "Sexual Health", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041835521", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"28367832400": {"Name": "Oberguggenberger A.S.", "AuthorID": "28367832400", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "55874720900": {"Name": "Nagele E.", "AuthorID": "55874720900", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz"}, "7003410058": {"Name": "Greimel E.", "AuthorID": "7003410058", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz"}, "36348268100": {"Name": "Inwald E.C.", "AuthorID": "36348268100", "AffiliationID": "60020016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Medical Center Regensburg"}, "42462726800": {"Name": "Tomaszewski K.", "AuthorID": "42462726800", "AffiliationID": "60109810", "AffiliationName": "Health Outcomes Research Unit, Department of Gerontology, Geriatrics, and Social Work, Faculty of Education, Ignatianum Academy"}, "10040678500": {"Name": "Lanceley A.", "AuthorID": "10040678500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women's Cancer, University College"}, "35170851900": {"Name": "Nordin A.", "AuthorID": "35170851900", "AffiliationID": "60028801", "AffiliationName": "East Kent Hospital"}, "6701531876": {"Name": "Creutzberg C.L.", "AuthorID": "6701531876", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Oncology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6506812011": {"Name": "Kuljanic K.", "AuthorID": "6506812011", "AffiliationID": "60077688", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital Centre Rijeka"}, "7004544225": {"Name": "Kardamakis D.", "AuthorID": "7004544225", "AffiliationID": "60024484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Patras Medical School"}, "38961962400": {"Name": "Schmalz C.", "AuthorID": "38961962400", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiotherapy, Christian-Albrechts-University Hospital Kiel"}, "6701753532": {"Name": "Arraras J.", "AuthorID": "6701753532", "AffiliationID": "60019454", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Department Hospital of Navarre"}, "56226848200": {"Name": "Costantini A.", "AuthorID": "56226848200", "AffiliationID": "60084996, 60032350", "AffiliationName": "Psychoncology Unit, Sant'Andrea Hospital, Sapienza University Rome"}, "14832201200": {"Name": "Almont T.", "AuthorID": "14832201200", "AffiliationID": "116723688", "AffiliationName": "Institute Universitaire du Cancer"}, "55194543700": {"Name": "Wei-Chu C.", "AuthorID": "55194543700", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Preventive Medicine, National Taiwan University"}, "57200596865": {"Name": "Dehandschutter S.", "AuthorID": "57200596865", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "University Hospitals Leuven"}, "6602369287": {"Name": "Winters Z.", "AuthorID": "6602369287", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60016447", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Sciences, Southmead Hospital, University of Bristol"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
