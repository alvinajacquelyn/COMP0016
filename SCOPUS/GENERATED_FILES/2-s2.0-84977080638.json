All rights reserved.Purpose: Cardiovascular reactivity to mental stress has been used as a tool to predict short-term hypertension risk in adults but the impact of cardiovascular reactivity in childhood on hypertension in adulthood is unknown. Using the 1970 British Cohort study, we examined the association between pulse rate reactivity in childhood and risk of hypertension in adulthood. Methods: A total of 6507 participants (51.6% women) underwent clinical examination at 10 years of age that involved measurement of blood pressure, BMI, and pulse rate pre and postexamination. Hypertension was ascertained by self-reported doctor diagnosis 32 years later at age 42. Results: On average, there was a reduction in pulse rate after the medical examination (-1.2 \u00b1 8.2 bpm), although nearly a third of the sample recorded an increase in pulse rate of at least 3 bpm. A total of 488 (7.5%) study members developed hypertension at follow-up. After adjustment for a range of covariates, including resting blood pressure and BMI in childhood, a heightened pulse rate response to the examination (\u22653 bpm) was associated with greater risk of hypertension in adulthood (odds ratio = 1.30, 95% confidence interval, 1.02, 1.67). The association persisted whether we modelled pulse rate as an absolute measure (postexamination) or a change score. Conclusion: These observational data suggest that elevated childhood cardiovascular reactivity could increase risk for hypertension in adulthood.", "AuthorKeywords": ["birth cohort", "epidemiology", "psychophysiology", "pulse rate", "stress"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blood Pressure", "Child", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Hypertension", "Male", "Odds Ratio", "Risk Factors", "Stress, Psychological", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977080638", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"8502496600": {"Name": "Hamer M.", "AuthorID": "8502496600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
