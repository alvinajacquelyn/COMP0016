All rights reserved.Pragmatics is often described as the study of language use, and contrasted with the study of language structure. In this broad sense, it covers a range of loosely related research programmes from formal studies of deictic expressions to sociological studies of ethnic verbal stereotypes. In a more focused sense (the one used here), pragmatics contrasts with semantics, the study of linguistic meaning, and is the study of how contextual factors interact with linguistic meaning in the interpretation of utterances. This article briefly highlights a range of closely related, fairly central pragmatic issues and approaches that have been of interest to linguists and philosophers of language in the past thirty years or so.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethnic verbal stereotypes", "Language structure", "Language studies", "Language use", "Linguistic meaning", "Pragmatics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923677539", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"6701821784": {"Name": "Sperber D.", "AuthorID": "6701821784", "AffiliationID": "60105767", "AffiliationName": "Institut Jean Nicod"}, "14066846800": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "14066846800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
