However, tracing this process has proven difficult. Lithium isotopes are a promising tracer of silicate weathering. This study has reacted basalt sand with natural river water for ~9 months in closed experiments, in order to examine the behaviour of Li isotopes during weathering. Aqueous Li concentrations decrease by a factor of ~10 with time, and \u03b47Li increases by ~19\u2030, implying that Li is being taken up into secondary phases that prefer 6Li. Mass balance using various selective leaches of the exchangeable and secondary mineral fractions suggest that ~12\u201316% of Li is adsorbed, and the remainder is removed into neoformed secondary minerals. The exchangeable fractionation factors have a \u03947Liexch-soln = \u221211.6 to \u221211.9\u2030, while the secondary minerals impose \u03947Lisecmin-soln = \u221222.5 to \u221223.9\u2030. Overall the experiment can be modelled with a Rayleigh fractionation factor of \u03b1 = 0.991, similar to that found for natural basaltic rivers. The mobility of Li relative to the carbon-cycle-critical cations of Ca and Mg changes with time, but rapidly evolves within one month to remarkably similar mobilities amongst these three elements. This evolution shows a linear relationship with \u03b47Li (largely due to a co-variation between aqueous [Li] and \u03b47Li), suggesting that Li isotopes have the potential to be used as a tracer of Ca and Mg mobility during basaltic weathering, and ultimately CO2 drawdown.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Basalt weathering", "Chemical weathering", "Isotope fractionation", "Weathering experiments"], "IndexKeywords": ["Basalt weathering", "Chemical weathering", "Experimental determination", "Fractionation factors", "Isotope fractionation", "Linear relationships", "Rayleigh fractionation", "Silicate weathering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065101440", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"57204707349": {"Name": "Pogge von Strandmann P.A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204707349", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57190175313": {"Name": "Tarbuck G.", "AuthorID": "57190175313", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57213099026": {"Name": "Wood I.G.", "AuthorID": "57213099026", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57195018773": {"Name": "Oelkers E.H.", "AuthorID": "57195018773", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "36970622700": {"Name": "Murphy M.J.", "AuthorID": "36970622700", "AffiliationID": "60009016, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Geochemistry and Isotope Centre (LOGIC), University College London and Birkbeck, University of London"}, "16444092500": {"Name": "Fraser W.T.", "AuthorID": "16444092500", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Geography, Oxford Brookes University"}, "17433887300": {"Name": "Hammond S.J.", "AuthorID": "17433887300", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment, Earth and Ecosystems Sciences, The Open University"}}}
