The class of operators covered by our analysis includes both the \u201cclassical\u201d case of uniformly elliptic families (where the ellipticity constant does not depend on \u03b5) and the \u201cdouble-porosity\u201d case of coefficients that take contrasting values of order one and of order \u03b52 in different parts of the period cell. We provide a construction for the leading order term of the \u201coperator asymptotics\u201d of (A\u03b5+I)-1 in the sense of operator-norm convergence and prove order O(\u03b5) remainder estimates.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954375275", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Mathematics (miscellaneous)", "MATH", "2601"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"6507202947": {"Name": "Cherednichenko K.", "AuthorID": "6507202947", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath"}, "56531294200": {"Name": "Cooper S.", "AuthorID": "56531294200", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath"}}}
