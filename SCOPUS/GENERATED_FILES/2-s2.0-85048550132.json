My aim here is to isolate Schelling\u2019s conception of transcendental method in the first decade of his philosophical development, a topic that has received little direct and extended discussion. Schelling\u2019s 1800 System of Transcendental Idealism stands out as of particular importance, but no single text can be regarded as Schelling\u2019s definitive statement of his views on the question of method in his early period, necessitating a diachronic approach. I argue that, though in important respects Schelling\u2019s concerns diverge from those of Kant and Fichte, Schelling should not be regarded as abandoning the transcendental framework, and is best understood as attempting to work out what is involved at the original point of adoption of the transcendental standpoint. This entails, I argue, exchanging transcendental philosophy\u2019s claim to a distinctive method for a substantive interpretation of the transcendental turn.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fichte", "Kant", "Naturphilosophie", "Schelling", "transcendental"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048550132", "SubjectAreas": [["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"26032865200": {"Name": "Gardner S.", "AuthorID": "26032865200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Philosophy, University College London"}}}
