To compare stromal riboflavin concentration after three corneal cross-linking (CXL) imbibition procedures: standard (EpiOff), transepithelial corneal (EpiOn), and iontophoresis-assisted technique (Ionto) using 0.1% hypotonic riboflavin phosphate. Methods. Randomized open-label pilot clinical study. Twelve corneas/12 patients with advanced keratoconus were randomly divided into 4 groups for CXL (n = 3). The corneas underwent imbibition with standard riboflavin EpiOff and with enhanced riboflavin solution (RICROLIN+) EpiOff, EpiOn, and iontophoresis techniques. Thereafter, deep anterior lamellar keratectomy procedure was performed and the obtained debrided corneal tissues were frozen. The maximal intrastromal riboflavin concentration was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (mcg/dg). Results. The mean stromal concentration of riboflavin was 2.02 \u00b1 0.72 mcg/dg in EpiOff group, 4.33 \u00b1 0.12 mcg/g in EpiOff-RICROLIN+ group, 0.63 \u00b1 0.21 mcg/dg in EpiOn-RICROLIN+ group, and 1.15 \u00b1 0.27 mcg/dg in iontophoresis RICROLIN+ group. A 7-fold decrease in intrastromal riboflavin concentration was observed comparing EpiOn-RICROLIN+ and EpiOff-RICROLIN+ groups. Conclusion. The present pilot study indicates that both transepithelial CXL techniques in combination with hypotonic enhanced riboflavin formulation (RICROLIN+) were still inferior to the standard CXL technique; however, larger clinical studies to further validate the results are needed and in progress.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957057040", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"36888305600": {"Name": "Franch A.", "AuthorID": "36888305600", "AffiliationID": "106543705", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, SS Giovanni e Paolo Hospital"}, "35331641100": {"Name": "Birattari F.", "AuthorID": "35331641100", "AffiliationID": "106543705", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, SS Giovanni e Paolo Hospital"}, "56595203000": {"Name": "Dal Mas G.", "AuthorID": "56595203000", "AffiliationID": "106543705", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, SS Giovanni e Paolo Hospital"}, "55800299200": {"Name": "Lu\u017enik Z.", "AuthorID": "55800299200", "AffiliationID": "60021479", "AffiliationName": "Eye Hospital, University Medical Centre"}, "54795700400": {"Name": "Parekh M.", "AuthorID": "54795700400", "AffiliationID": "60172700", "AffiliationName": "Fondazione Banca Degli Occhi Del Veneto, C/o Padiglione G.
