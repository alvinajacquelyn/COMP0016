Patients typically present with kidney impairment and progress to end-stage renal disease over a median time of 4.6 years. Methods Six patients presented with proteinuria, hypertension, and/or lower limb edema and underwent detailed clinical and laboratory investigations. Results A novel FGA gene mutation was identified in each case: 2 frameshift mutations F521Sfs*27 and G519Efs*30 and 4 single base substitutions G555F, E526K, E524K, R554H. In 5 subjects, extensive amyloid deposits were found solely within the glomeruli, which stained specifically with antibodies to fibrinogen A alpha chain, and in one of these cases, we found coexistent fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease. One patient was diagnosed with light-chain amyloidosis after a bone marrow examination revealed a small clonal plasma cell population, and laser microdissection of the amyloid deposits followed by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry identified kappa light chain as the fibril protein. Discussion We report 6 novel mutations in the FGA gene: 5 were associated with renal fibrinogen A alpha chain amyloidosis and 1 was found to be incidental to light-chain amyloid deposits discovered in a patient with a plasma cell dyscrasia. Clinical awareness and suspicion of hereditary amyloidosis corroborated by genetic analysis and adequate typing using combined immunohistochemistry and laser microdissection and mass spectrometry is valuable to avoid misdiagnosis, especially when a family history of amyloidosis is absent.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anti-GBM glomerulonephritis", "end-stage renal disease (ESRD)", "fibrinogen A alpha chain", "hereditary renal amyloidosis", "mass spectrometry-based proteomics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024842851", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"14012189400": {"Name": "Rowczenio D.", "AuthorID": "14012189400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "7005657127": {"Name": "Gilbertson J.A.", "AuthorID": "7005657127", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "35493762000": {"Name": "Taylor G.", "AuthorID": "35493762000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "57218199523": {"Name": "Rendell N.", "AuthorID": "57218199523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "6506002568": {"Name": "Wechalekar A.D.", "AuthorID": "6506002568", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "35464959200": {"Name": "Hawkins P.N.", "AuthorID": "35464959200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "7003539031": {"Name": "Gillmore J.D.", "AuthorID": "7003539031", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, Division of Medicine, Royal Free Campus, UCL"}, "26028429700": {"Name": "Stensland M.", "AuthorID": "26028429700", "AffiliationID": "60026108, 60010348", "AffiliationName": "Proteomic Core Facility, Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet and University of Oslo"}, "24178355700": {"Name": "de Souza G.A.", "AuthorID": "24178355700", "AffiliationID": "60026108, 60010348", "AffiliationName": "Proteomic Core Facility, Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet and University of Oslo"}, "7006061970": {"Name": "Str\u00f8m E.H.", "AuthorID": "7006061970", "AffiliationID": "60026108", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet"}, "6602377168": {"Name": "Wien T.N.", "AuthorID": "6602377168", "AffiliationID": "60020216", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, B\u00e6rum Hospital"}, "6602150049": {"Name": "Minogue S.", "AuthorID": "6602150049", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lipid and Membrane Biology Group, Division of Medicine, UCL"}, "35181060700": {"Name": "Efebera Y.A.", "AuthorID": "35181060700", "AffiliationID": "60003500", "AffiliationName": "Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University"}, "7005437699": {"Name": "Heimdal K.R.", "AuthorID": "7005437699", "AffiliationID": "60026108", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet"}, "13807641000": {"Name": "Selvig K.", "AuthorID": "13807641000", "AffiliationID": "112880501", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Drammen Hospital"}, "6508197414": {"Name": "L\u00e6greid I.K.", "AuthorID": "6508197414", "AffiliationID": "60023052", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nephrology, St. Olavs Hospital"}, "24491429700": {"Name": "Demoulin N.", "AuthorID": "24491429700", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche Exp\u00e9rimentale et Clinique, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"}, "9732531100": {"Name": "Aydin S.", "AuthorID": "9732531100", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Recherche Exp\u00e9rimentale et Clinique, Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain"}}}
