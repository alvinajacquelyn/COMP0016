The objective of this study was to detect clinically signifcant and insignifcant prostate cancer on 18F-fluoroethylcholine (FECH) PET/CT and to correlate fndings with transperineal template-guided prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Fifty-six lobes of the prostate were analyzed in 28 men who underwent FECH PET/CT and TPM. Whole-body images and pelvic images were acquired at 60 and 90 minutes after tracer administration. FECH PET/CT fndings were correlated with TPM. Sensitivity, specifcity, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, and AUC of dual phase FECH PET/CT were calculated. RESULTS. Mean age of the patients was 68.8 years (range, 53-79 years), and mean prostate-specifc antigen level was 12.1 ng/mL (range, 0.6-45 ng/mL). Mean maximum cancer core length was 4.4 mm (median, 4 mm; range, 1-14 mm) and mean total cancer core length, 14.6 mm (median, 14.6 mm; range, 1-82 mm). Prostate cancer was identifed in 38 lobes with a Gleason score of 6 in fve lobes (13%), 7 in 27 lobes (71%), 8 in four lobes (11%), and 9 in two lobes (5%). FECH PET/CT showed fndings of prostate cancer in 46/56 lobes (82%). The ranges for maximum standardized uptake value for 60-and 90-minute FECH PET/CT were 1.3-11.4 and 1.2-10.9, respectively. Clinically signifcant cancer was seen in 30 of 38 positive lobes; eight had clinically insignifcant disease. For 60-minute imaging, the sensitivity, specifcity, and ROC AUC were 75%, 75%, and 0.746 (95% CI, 0.612-0.853). For 90-minute imaging, the sensitivity, specifcity, and ROC AUC were 73.7%, 58.3%, and 0.646 (95% CI, 0.498-0.776). Overall sensitivity, specifcity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 95%, 50%, 82.6%, and 80%, respectively. CONCLUSION. FECH PET/CT can detect prostate cancer and localizes TPM biopsyproven clinically signifcant prostate cancer with sensitivity of greater than 89.7%. Of the two imaging durations, 60-minute imaging is more sensitive and specifc than 90-minute imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fluoroethylcholine", "MRI", "PET/CT", "Prostate cancer", "Template-Guided prostate mapping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Choline", "Humans", "Image-Guided Biopsy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Interventional", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Neoplasm Invasiveness", "Observer Variation", "Pilot Projects", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Statistics as Topic", "Tumor Burden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999188187", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55695155900": {"Name": "Haroon A.", "AuthorID": "55695155900", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "St. Bartholomew's Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "36894621800": {"Name": "Almuhaideb A.", "AuthorID": "36894621800", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8960246500": {"Name": "Kayani I.", "AuthorID": "8960246500", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8960246600": {"Name": "Dickson J.", "AuthorID": "8960246600", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, University College London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "9739106900": {"Name": "Cathcart P.", "AuthorID": "9739106900", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College Hospital"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University College Hospital"}}}
