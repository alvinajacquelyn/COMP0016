Electrodes modified by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) exhibit reduced double layer effects and are used in molecular electronics. An important quantity for calculating the electron transfer rate constant is the reorganization energy, which is associated with changes in the solute geometry and the environment. In this Letter, an approach for calculating the electrochemical reorganization energy for a redox molecule attached to or near a SAM modified electrode is presented. This integral equations formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM) approach accounts for the detailed electronic structure of the molecule, as well as the contributions from the electrode, SAM, and electronic and inertial solvent responses. The calculated total reorganization energies are in good agreement with experimental data for a series of metal complexes in aqueous solution. This approach will be useful for calculating electron transfer rate constants for molecular electrocatalysts.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Double layer effect", "Electrochemical electron", "Electron-transfer rate constants", "Modified electrodes", "Polarizable continuum model", "Reorganization energies", "Technological applications", "Total reorganization energy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939156145", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57220950529": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "57220950529", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}, "7004505104": {"Name": "Hammes-Schiffer S.", "AuthorID": "7004505104", "AffiliationID": "60000745", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"}}}
