All rights reserved.This paper presents a novel real-world application for energy savings in a Smart Building environment. The proposed system unifies heterogeneous wireless sensor networks under a Semantic Web Service middleware. Two complementary and mutually exclusive rule-based approaches for enforcing energy-saving policies are proposed: a reactive agent based on production rules and a deliberative agent based on defeasible logic. The system was deployed at a Greek University, showing promising experimental results (at least 4% daily savings). Although the percentage of energy savings may seem low, the greatest merit of the method is ensuring that no energy is wasted by constantly enforcing the policies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ambient intelligence", "Defeasible logic", "Energy savings", "Semantic web services", "Smart building"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building environment", "Defeasible logic", "Deliberative agents", "Energy saving policies", "Exclusive Rule", "Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks", "Production rules", "Rule-based approach"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929050036", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"36609030500": {"Name": "Stavropoulos T.G.", "AuthorID": "36609030500", "AffiliationID": "60158100", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Technology, International Hellenic University"}, "6603620714": {"Name": "Bassiliades N.", "AuthorID": "6603620714", "AffiliationID": "60158100", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Technology, International Hellenic University"}, "56261927800": {"Name": "Argyriou J.", "AuthorID": "56261927800", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "8088070700": {"Name": "Vrakas D.", "AuthorID": "8088070700", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "57191439209": {"Name": "Vlahavas I.", "AuthorID": "57191439209", "AffiliationID": "60015331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki"}, "13408692000": {"Name": "Kontopoulos E.", "AuthorID": "13408692000", "AffiliationID": "120966033", "AffiliationName": "Information Technologies Institute, Centre of Research and Technology - Hellas"}, "11641015900": {"Name": "Bikakis A.", "AuthorID": "11641015900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
