Prefrontal hemodynamic responses are observed during performance of motor tasks. Using a dance video game (DVG), a complex motor task that requires temporally accurate footsteps with given visual and auditory cues, we investigated whether 20 h of DVG training modified hemodynamic responses of the prefrontal cortex in six healthy young adults. Approach. Fronto-temporal activity during actual DVG play was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) pre- and post-training. To evaluate the training-induced changes in the time-courses of fNIRS signals, we employed a regression analysis using the task-specific template fNIRS signals that were generated from alternate well-trained and/or novice DVG players. The HRF was also separately incorporated as a template to construct an alternate regression model. Change in coefficients for template functions at pre- and post- training were determined and compared among different models. Main results. Training significantly increased the motor performance using the number of temporally accurate steps in the DVG as criteria. The mean oxygenated hemoglobin (\u0394oxyHb) waveform changed from an activation above baseline pattern to that of a below baseline pattern. Participants showed significantly decreased coefficients for regressors of the \u0394oxyHb response of novice players and HRF. The model using \u0394oxyHb responses from both well-trained and novice players of DVG as templates showed the best fit for the \u0394oxyHb responses of the participants at both pre- and post-training when analyzed with Akaike information criteria. Significance. These results suggest that the coefficients for the template \u0394oxyHb responses of the novice players are sensitive indicators of motor learning during the initial stage of training and thus clinically useful to determine the improvement in motor performance when patients are engaged in a specific rehabilitation program.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dance video game", "FNIRS", "Motor learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Akaike information criterion", "FNIRS", "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs)", "Hemodynamic response", "Motor learning", "Oxygenated hemoglobin", "Rehabilitation programs", "Video game", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Learning", "Male", "Motor Skills", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Video Games", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982099141", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7402959957": {"Name": "Ono Y.", "AuthorID": "7402959957", "AffiliationID": "60022180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Bioinformatics, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University"}, "55759972000": {"Name": "Nomoto Y.", "AuthorID": "55759972000", "AffiliationID": "60022180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Bioinformatics, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University"}, "57203693737": {"Name": "Suzuki T.", "AuthorID": "57203693737", "AffiliationID": "60022180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Bioinformatics, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University"}, "8102204300": {"Name": "Shimada S.", "AuthorID": "8102204300", "AffiliationID": "60022180", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Bioinformatics, School of Science and Technology, Meiji University"}, "36789839000": {"Name": "Noah J.", "AuthorID": "36789839000", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine"}, "57188577368": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57188577368", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine"}, "6604093091": {"Name": "Bronner S.", "AuthorID": "6604093091", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Yale School of Medicine"}, "35299240000": {"Name": "Hirsch J.", "AuthorID": "35299240000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Gower St. University College London"}, "24336568200": {"Name": "Tachibana A.", "AuthorID": "24336568200", "AffiliationID": "60005050", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histology and Neurobiology, Dokkyo Medical University, School of Medicine"}}}
