We assessed the potential of a CYP3A4 inhibitor (itraconazole) and inducer (rifampin) to alter the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of olaparib following single oral tablet doses. Methods Two Phase I, open-label, non-randomized trials were conducted in patients with advanced solid tumors. In Study 7, patients received olaparib alone and co-administered with itraconazole; in Study 8, a separate group of patients received olaparib alone and co-administered with rifampin. No interaction between itraconazole and olaparib was concluded if two-sided 90% CIs for the treatment ratios of AUC and/or AUC0\u2013t and Cmax fell within the bioequivalence range of 0.80\u20131.25. An interaction between rifampin and olaparib was concluded if the lower limit of the 90% CI for the treatment ratios was <0.5 (ie, >50% decrease in olaparib AUC or Cmax in the presence of rifampin compared with olaparib alone). Findings In Study 7 (N = 59; 17 male, 42 female), 56 and 53 patients were evaluable for PK analysis following treatment with olaparib alone and olaparib plus itraconazole, respectively; in Study 8 (N = 22; 4 male, 18 female), all patients were evaluable. Co-administration of olaparib with itraconazole resulted in a statistically significant increase in the relative bioavailability of olaparib: Cmax treatment ratio, 1.42 (90% CI, 1.33\u20131.52); mean AUC treatment ratio, 2.70 (90% CI, 2.44\u20132.97). Mean CL/F and Vz/F were reduced (8.16 vs 3.05 L/h and 192 vs 75.1 L), although mean t\u00bd was unchanged (15.0 vs 15.6 hours). Co-administration of olaparib with rifampin resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the relative bioavailability of olaparib: Cmax treatment ratio, 0.29 (90% CI, 0.24\u20130.33); mean AUC treatment ratio, 0.13 (90% CI, 0.11\u20130.16). CL/F and Vz/F were increased when olaparib and rifampin were co-administered (6.36 vs 48.3 L/h and 112 vs 1076 L); however, mean t\u00bd was unchanged (13.0 vs 15.8 hours). Safety data for olaparib following tablet dosing were consistent with the known safety profile. Implications Exposure to olaparib was significantly increased when co-administered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole, and significantly decreased when co-administered with the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampin, compared with olaparib alone. Potent CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors and inducers should be avoided during olaparib treatment.
