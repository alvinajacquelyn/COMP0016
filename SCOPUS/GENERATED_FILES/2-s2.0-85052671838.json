Here, we compare these hypotheses across four regions of prefrontal cortex (PFC) in an oculomotor-delayed-response task, where an intervening cue indicated the reward available for a correct saccade. WM representations were strongest in ventrolateral PFC neurons with higher intrinsic temporal stability (time-constant). At the population-level, although a stable mnemonic state was reached during the delay, this tuning geometry was reversed relative to cue-period selectivity, and was disrupted by the reward cue. Single-neuron analysis revealed many neurons switched to coding reward, rather than maintaining task-relevant spatial selectivity until saccade. These results imply WM is fulfilled by dynamic, population-level activity within high time-constant neurons. Rather than persistent activity supporting stable mnemonic representations that bridge subsequent salient stimuli, PFC neurons may stabilise a dynamic population-level process supporting WM.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Macaca mulatta", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Prefrontal Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052671838", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191443136": {"Name": "Cavanagh S.E.", "AuthorID": "57191443136", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, University College London"}, "57203716011": {"Name": "Towers J.P.", "AuthorID": "57203716011", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, University College London"}, "16042550200": {"Name": "Hunt L.T.", "AuthorID": "16042550200", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "6603245038": {"Name": "Kennerley S.W.", "AuthorID": "6603245038", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California at Berkeley"}, "7103223282": {"Name": "Wallis J.D.", "AuthorID": "7103223282", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California at Berkeley"}}}
