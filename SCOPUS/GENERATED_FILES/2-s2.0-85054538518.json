All rights reserved.Current findings continue to support the concept of a biologically defective decidua rather than a primarily abnormally invasive trophoblast. Prior cesarean sections increase the risk of placenta previa and both adherent and invasive placenta accreta, suggesting that the endometrial/decidual defect following the iatrogenic creation of a uterine myometrium scar has an adverse effect on early implantation. Preferential attachment of the blastocyst to scar tissue facilitates abnormally deep invasion of trophoblastic cells and interactions with the radial and arcuate arteries. Subsequent high velocity maternal arterial inflow into the placenta creates large lacunae, destroying the normal cotyledonary arrangement of the villi.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Histopathology", "Placenta accreta", "Placenta increta", "Placenta percreta", "Ultrasound diagnosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cesarean Section", "Cicatrix", "Decidua", "Female", "Humans", "Myometrium", "Placenta Accreta", "Placenta Previa", "Placental Circulation", "Pregnancy", "Trophoblasts", "Ultrasonography, Prenatal", "Uterine Artery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054538518", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57203176734": {"Name": "Jauniaux E.", "AuthorID": "57203176734", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Women's Health, Academic Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7201844309": {"Name": "Burton G.", "AuthorID": "7201844309", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, Centre for Trophoblast Research, University of Cambridge"}}}
