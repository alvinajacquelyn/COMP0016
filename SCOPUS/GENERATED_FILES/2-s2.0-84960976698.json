A dual optical tweezers was made by splitting and recombining a single Nd:YAG laser beam. RBCs were trapped directly (i.e., without microbead handles) in the dual optical tweezers where they were observed to adopt a \"side-on\" orientation. RBC initial and final lengths after stretching were measured by digital video microscopy, and a Deformability index (DI) calculated. Blood from 8 healthy controls, 5 T2DM and 7 DR patients with respective mean age of 52.4yrs, 51.6 yrs and 52 yrs was analysed. Initial average length of RBCs for control group was 8.45 \u00b1 0.25 \u03bcm, 8.68 \u00b1 0.49 \u03bcm for DM RBCs and 8.82 \u00b1 0.32 \u03bcm for DR RBCs (p < 0.001). The DI for control group was 0.0698 \u00b1 0.0224, and that for DM RBCs was 0.0645 \u00b1 0.03 and 0.0635 \u00b1 0.028 (p < 0.001) for DR group. DI was inversely related to basal length of RBCs (p = 0.02). DI of RBC from DM and DR patients was significantly lower in comparison with normal healthy controls. A dual optical tweezers method can hence be reliably used to assess RBC deformability.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Shape", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Diabetic Retinopathy", "Erythrocyte Deformability", "Erythrocytes", "Female", "Hematology", "Humans", "Male", "Microscopy, Video", "Middle Aged", "Optical Tweezers", "Pilot Projects", "Regression Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960976698", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7201475180": {"Name": "Agrawal R.", "AuthorID": "7201475180", "AffiliationID": "60002481, 60095080", "AffiliationName": "National Healthcare Group Eye Institute, Tan Tock Seng Hospital"}, "56730968100": {"Name": "Nobre-Cardoso J.", "AuthorID": "56730968100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7003495942": {"Name": "Pavesio C.", "AuthorID": "7003495942", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57014506400": {"Name": "Bhatnagar R.", "AuthorID": "57014506400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004710153": {"Name": "Shima D.", "AuthorID": "7004710153", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "56970895100": {"Name": "Smart T.", "AuthorID": "56970895100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56970564300": {"Name": "Richards C.", "AuthorID": "56970564300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55474788000": {"Name": "Jones P.H.", "AuthorID": "55474788000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
