In this context, previous studies have considered fixed inter-antenna distance, which implies an increasing array aperture as the number of elements increases. Here, we focus on a practical, space-constrained topology, where an increase in the number of antenna elements in a fixed total space imposes an inversely proportional decrease in the inter-antenna distance. Our analysis shows that, contrary to existing studies, inter-user interference does not vanish in the massive MIMO regime, thereby creating a saturation effect on the achievable rate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antenna arrays", "favorable propagation", "massive MIMO"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antenna element", "Asymptotic limits", "Channel vectors", "Inter-user interference", "Saturation effects"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929311340", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "23051214500": {"Name": "Matthaiou M.", "AuthorID": "23051214500", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology"}}}
