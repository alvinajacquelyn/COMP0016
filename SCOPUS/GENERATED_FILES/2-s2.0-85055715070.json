Subsequently, in order to implement CBL at school, a group of scenarios has been produced by several stakeholders. However, there is a lack of resources to measure effectively what makes a good scenario. Thus, this study aims to develop and validate a scenario evaluation instrument to examine students\u2019 perspectives on science career-related scenarios through the lens of relevance and interest. For this purpose, 25 science career-related scenarios and a measurement tool, Scenario Evaluation with Relevance and Interest (SERI), were developed by a team of researchers for the EU funded MultiCO project. Then, lower secondary school students from three different countries, Estonia, Finland, and the UK, were asked to respond to the newly developed instrument after reading the scenarios, and their responses were analyzed by factor analyses and multivariate analysis of variance. According to the result, this instrument has good construct validity and reliability. However, it indicates one issue of discriminant validity between two factors, individual dimension and societal dimension. Also, significant gender differences were found in the Estonian sample regarding students\u2019 perspectives on the scenarios. Possible interpretations of the results and implications of the suggested measurement tool are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Context-based learning", "Interest", "Measurement tool", "Relevance", "Scenario evaluation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055715070", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"57194026291": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "57194026291", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Educational Science and Teacher Education, University of Eastern Finland"}, "55859897000": {"Name": "Keinonen T.", "AuthorID": "55859897000", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "School of Applied Educational Science and Teacher Education, University of Eastern Finland"}, "56182180700": {"Name": "Simon S.", "AuthorID": "56182180700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "18435474900": {"Name": "Rannikm\u00e4e M.", "AuthorID": "18435474900", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Science Education, University of Tartu"}, "57192420670": {"Name": "Soobard R.", "AuthorID": "57192420670", "AffiliationID": "60068856", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Science Education, University of Tartu"}, "57190159954": {"Name": "Direito I.", "AuthorID": "57190159954", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Engineering Education, University College London"}}}
