We collated all published data on the efficacy and safety of topical timolol in the treatment of infantile hemangioma. A total of 31 studies with 691 patients were included. The fixed effects pooled estimate of the response rate defined as any improvement from baseline of infantile hemangioma after treatment with topical timolol was significant (RR = 8.96; 95% CI 5.07\u201315.47; heterogeneity test p = 0.99), and the treatment was overall well tolerated. However, the quality of evidence was low to moderate. Topical timolol is an effective treatment for small infantile hemangioma, with no significant adverse effects noted. However, there is still a need for adequately powered randomised controlled trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Beta-blocker", "Infantile hemangioma", "Timolol"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Cutaneous", "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Age of Onset", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Hemangioma", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Odds Ratio", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Timolol", "Treatment Outcome", "Tumor Burden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032669123", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"57196326902": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "57196326902", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803", "AffiliationName": "St. John\u2019s Institute of Dermatology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55221204600": {"Name": "Boyce A.", "AuthorID": "55221204600", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Unit for Population-Based Dermatology Research, Department of Paediatric Dermatology, St John\u2019s Institute of Dermatology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College London"}, "26039566200": {"Name": "Wedgeworth E.", "AuthorID": "26039566200", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Unit for Population-Based Dermatology Research, Department of Paediatric Dermatology, St John\u2019s Institute of Dermatology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College London"}, "6603013344": {"Name": "Flohr C.", "AuthorID": "6603013344", "AffiliationID": "60005518, 60002803, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Unit for Population-Based Dermatology Research, Department of Paediatric Dermatology, St John\u2019s Institute of Dermatology, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust and King\u2019s College London"}, "24478918700": {"Name": "Prieto-Merino D.", "AuthorID": "24478918700", "AffiliationID": "60109394", "AffiliationName": "Catholic University of Murcia"}, "55293247800": {"Name": "Svensson \u00c5.", "AuthorID": "55293247800", "AffiliationID": "60029170, 60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Institute of Clinical Research in Malm\u00f6, Lund University, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}}}
