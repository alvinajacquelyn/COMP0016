Aims: This paper has two goals: first, to increase awareness and understanding of the limitations of therapy study designs and statistical techniques and, second, to suggest some designs and statistical techniques likely to produce intervention studies that can inform both theories of therapy and service provision. Main Contribution & Conclusions: We recommend a single-case experimental design that incorporates the following features. First, there should be random allocation of stimuli to treated and control conditions with matching for baseline performance, using relatively large stimulus sets to increase confidence in the data. Second, prior to intervention, baseline testing should occur on at least two occasions. Simulations show that termination of the baseline phase should not be contingent on \u201cstability.\u201d For intervention, a predetermined number of sessions are required (rather than performance-determined duration). Finally, treatment effects must be significantly better than expected by chance to be confident that the results reflect change greater than random variation. Appropriate statistical analysis is important: by-item statistical analysis methods are strongly recommended and a methodology is presented using WEighted STatistics (WEST).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926418259", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["LPN and LVN", "NURS", "2912"]], "AuthorData": {"35848524900": {"Name": "Howard D.", "AuthorID": "35848524900", "AffiliationID": "60006222", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Research in Linguistics and Language Sciences and Tavistock Aphasia Centre North-East, Newcastle University"}, "7006621998": {"Name": "Best W.", "AuthorID": "7006621998", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Science, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, UCL"}, "6603789089": {"Name": "Nickels L.", "AuthorID": "6603789089", "AffiliationID": "60019544, 60088314", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognitive Science, ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and Its Disorders (CCD) & NHMRC Centre of Clinical Excellence in Aphasia Rehabilitation, Macquarie University"}}}
