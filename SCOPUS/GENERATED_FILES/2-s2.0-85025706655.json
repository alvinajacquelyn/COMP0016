The gold standard procedure is complete tubal excision. Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the presence of residual fimbrial/tubal tissue on ovarian surfaces after salpingectomy. Study Design Prospective analysis of patients who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy for benign indications, early cervical cancer, or low-risk endometrial cancer at a UK National Health Service Trust. Salpingectomy with or without hysterectomy was performed initially, followed by oophorectomy within the same operation. Separately retrieved tubes and ovaries were sectioned serially and examined completely histologically. The main outcome measure was histologically identified fimbrial/ tubal tissue on ovarian surface. Chi-square/Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate categoric variables. Results Twenty-five consecutive cases (mean age, 54.8 \u00b1 5.0 years) that comprised 41 adnexae (unilateral, 9; bilateral, 16) were analyzed. Seventeen (68.0%), 5 (20.0%), and 3 (12.0%) procedures were performed by consultant gynecologists, subspecialty/specialist trainees, and consultant gynecologic oncologists, respectively. Twelve of 25 procedures (48.0%) were laparoscopic, and 13 of 25 procedures (52.0%) involved laparotomy. Four of 25 patients (16.0%; 95% confidence interval, 4.5\u201336.1%) or 4 of 41 adnexae (9.8%; 95% confidence interval, 2.7\u201323.1%) showed residual microscopic fimbrial tissue on the ovarian surface. Tubes/ovaries were free of adhesions in 23 cases. Two cases had dense adnexal adhesions, but neither had residual fimbrial tissue on the ovary. Residual fimbrial tissue was not associated significantly with surgical route or experience (consultant, 3/20 [15%]; trainee, 1/5 [20%]; P=1.0). Conclusion Residual fimbrial tissue remains on the ovary after salpingectomy in a significant proportion of cases and could impact the level of risk-reduction that is obtained.", "AuthorKeywords": ["high-grade serous carcinoma", "ovarian cancer", "ovarian surface", "residual fimbrial tissue", "salpingectomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fallopian Tubes", "Female", "Humans", "Hysterectomy", "Middle Aged", "Ovary", "Prospective Studies", "Salpingectomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025706655", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57193211116": {"Name": "Gan C.", "AuthorID": "57193211116", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel"}, "35168788400": {"Name": "Brockbank E.", "AuthorID": "35168788400", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel"}, "55523172300": {"Name": "Lawrence A.C.", "AuthorID": "55523172300", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel"}, "6602377934": {"Name": "Jeyarajah A.R.", "AuthorID": "6602377934", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel"}, "55396325700": {"Name": "Oram D.", "AuthorID": "55396325700", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gynaecological Oncology, Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel"}, "7006828259": {"Name": "Manchanda R.", "AuthorID": "7006828259", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square"}, "6701340352": {"Name": "Chenoy R.", "AuthorID": "6701340352", "AffiliationID": "60014048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Newham University Hospital"}, "6505892128": {"Name": "Saravanamuthu J.", "AuthorID": "6505892128", "AffiliationID": "60014048", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Newham University Hospital"}, "7003438165": {"Name": "Hollingworth A.", "AuthorID": "7003438165", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "9735910400": {"Name": "Vimplis S.", "AuthorID": "9735910400", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "7004465559": {"Name": "Deo N.", "AuthorID": "7004465559", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "57195132405": {"Name": "Lam S.S.", "AuthorID": "57195132405", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Royal London Hospital"}, "16645225900": {"Name": "Faruqi A.", "AuthorID": "16645225900", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Royal London Hospital"}, "7404363652": {"Name": "Singh N.", "AuthorID": "7404363652", "AffiliationID": "60010088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Royal London Hospital"}, "56721050600": {"Name": "Chandrasekaran D.", "AuthorID": "56721050600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square"}}}
