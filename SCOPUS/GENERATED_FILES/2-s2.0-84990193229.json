All Rights Reserved.The continued success of the live attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine in preventing varicella-zoster and herpes zoster is well documented, as are many of the mutations that contribute to the attenuation of the vOka virus for replication in skin. At least three different preparations of vOka are marketed. Here, we show using deep sequencing of seven batches of vOka vaccine (including ZostaVax, VariVax, VarilRix, and the Oka/Biken working seed) from three different manufacturers (VariVax, GSK, and Biken) that 137 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations are present in all vaccine batches. This includes six sites at which the vaccine allele is fixed or near fixation, which we speculate are likely to be important for attenuation. We also show that despite differences in the vaccine populations between preparations, batch-to-batch variation is minimal, as is the number and frequency of mutations unique to individual batches. This suggests that the vaccine manufacturing processes are not introducing new mutations and that, notwithstanding the mixture of variants present, VZV live vaccines are extremely stable.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Chickenpox Vaccine", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Vaccines, Attenuated", "Virulence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990193229", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"55800090700": {"Name": "Depledge D.", "AuthorID": "55800090700", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Medical Molecular Virology, Division of Infection and Immunity"}, "7103276052": {"Name": "Yamanishi K.", "AuthorID": "7103276052", "AffiliationID": "60025814", "AffiliationName": "The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University"}, "7006788832": {"Name": "Gomi Y.", "AuthorID": "7006788832", "AffiliationID": "60025814", "AffiliationName": "The Research Foundation for Microbial Diseases of Osaka University"}, "7005375574": {"Name": "Gershon A.", "AuthorID": "7005375574", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Disease, Columbia University Medical Center"}}}
