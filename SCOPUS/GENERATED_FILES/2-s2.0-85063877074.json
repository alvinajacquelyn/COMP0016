This paper assesses the economic feasibility of producing hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) using waste vegetable oils as feedstock. The supply of hydrogen for the upgrading of the oil is obtained through a high-temperature electrolysis process, fed by low-carbon electricity. The use of waste materials eliminates the competition with food crops (e.g. soybean or rapeseed) and promotes the recycle of substances that should be treated for disposal. The results of the study show that the production cost of HVO with the considered plant are around 33% higher than that of fossil diesel. Moreover, the variable that has the strongest impact on the production cost of HVO is the price of the waste vegetable oil, which affects the final results more than the electricity price and the cost of the electrolyser.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrolysis", "Hydro-treated Vegetable Oil", "Liquid Biofuel", "SOEC", "Waste Vegetable Oil"], "IndexKeywords": ["Economic feasibilities", "Electricity prices", "High temperature electrolysis", "Liquid biofuels", "Low-carbon electricities", "Production process", "SOEC", "Waste vegetable oil"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063877074", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"56559724300": {"Name": "Lorenzi G.", "AuthorID": "56559724300", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy Technology, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"}, "9249548800": {"Name": "Silva C.", "AuthorID": "9249548800", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051", "AffiliationName": "IN+, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7006438708": {"Name": "Santarelli M.", "AuthorID": "7006438708", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy (DENERG), Politecnico di Torino"}, "57208130850": {"Name": "Mignini L.", "AuthorID": "57208130850", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Energy (DENERG), Politecnico di Torino"}, "57193182782": {"Name": "Venezia B.", "AuthorID": "57193182782", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
