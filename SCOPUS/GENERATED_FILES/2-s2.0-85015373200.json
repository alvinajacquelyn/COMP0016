Unfortunately, data on tumour stage are often missing for a non-negligible proportion of patients and the mechanism giving rise to the missingness is usually anything but completely at random. In this setting, restricting analysis to the subset of complete records gives typically biased results. Multiple imputation is a promising practical approach to the issues raised by the missing data, but its use in conjunction with the Pohar-Perme method for estimating net survival has not been formally evaluated. Methods We performed a resampling study using colorectal cancer population-based registry data to evaluate the ability of multiple imputation, used along with the Pohar-Perme method, to deliver unbiased estimates of stage-specific net survival and recover missing stage information. We created 1000 independent data sets, each containing 5000 patients. Stage data were then made missing at random under two scenarios (30% and 50% missingness). Results Complete records analysis showed substantial bias and poor confidence interval coverage. Across both scenarios our multiple imputation strategy virtually eliminated the bias and greatly improved confidence interval coverage. Conclusions In the presence of missing stage data complete records analysis often gives severely biased results. We showed that combining multiple imputation with the Pohar-Perme estimator provides a valid practical approach for the estimation of stage-specific colorectal cancer net survival. As usual, when the percentage of missing data is high the results should be interpreted cautiously and sensitivity analyses are recommended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Informative censoring", "Multiple imputation", "Net survival", "Pohar-Perme estimator", "Uncongeniality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Bias (Epidemiology)", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Survival Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015373200", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"24080253900": {"Name": "Falcaro M.", "AuthorID": "24080253900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7402041051": {"Name": "Carpenter J.", "AuthorID": "7402041051", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}}}
