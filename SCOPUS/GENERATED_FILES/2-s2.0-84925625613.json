The mixed sampling (sensing) procedure hybridizes adaptive edge measurements extracted from a low-resolution image with uniform random measurements predefined for the high-resolution image to be recovered. The mixed sensing matrix seamlessly captures important information of an image, and meanwhile approximately satisfies the restricted isometry property. To recover the high-resolution image from MAR measurements, the total variation algorithm based on the compressive sensing theory is employed for solving the Lagrangian regularization problem. Both peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity results demonstrate the MAR sensing framework shows much better recovery performance than the completely random sensing one. The work is particularly helpful for high-performance and lost-cost data acquisition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compressive sensing", "Data acquisition", "Mixed adaptive-random sampling", "Total variation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compressive sensing", "High resolution image", "Low resolution images", "Peak signal to noise ratio", "Random sampling", "Restricted isometry properties", "Structural similarity", "Total variation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925625613", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Media Technology", "ENGI", "2214"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57089373800": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "57089373800", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "56571838700": {"Name": "Jin Z.", "AuthorID": "56571838700", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong"}, "7202973656": {"Name": "Chao H.", "AuthorID": "7202973656", "AffiliationID": "60021182", "AffiliationName": "School of Software, Sun Yat-sen University"}}}
