Published by Taylor & Francis.This paper evaluates parental leave policies across six Anglophone countries (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK and the USA) to assess system fit with a liberal welfare regime classification. The focus is on comparison within welfare regime classification (rather than between regimes), enabling complexity and variation to be explored. The comparative policy analysis uses national government and international Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data sources with case studies of policy change between 2004 and 2014 in Australia and the UK. Evidence suggests that contrary to market-oriented, liberal welfare regime predictions, there has been an expanding role of the state in developing parental leave policies, extending their duration and increasing the payment level. With the exception of the USA, parental leave provision, predominately maternal in focus, is embedded in the state policies of contemporary liberal welfare countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Australia", "fathers", "maternity leave", "parental leave policies", "the UK", "welfare regimes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929862143", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"7201685786": {"Name": "Baird M.", "AuthorID": "7201685786", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Department of Employment Relations and Director of the Women\u2640 Work Research Group, University of Sydney Business School"}, "57189165363": {"Name": "O'Brien M.", "AuthorID": "57189165363", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Coram Research Unit, Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
