However, it is unclear which passivation route is more effective for film stability. Here, we directly compare the optoelectronic properties and stability of thin films when passivating triple-cation perovskite films with potassium or rubidium species. The optoelectronic and chemical studies reveal that the alloyed perovskites are tolerant toward higher loadings of potassium than rubidium. Whereas potassium complexes with bromide from the perovskite precursor solution to form thin surface passivation layers, rubidium additives favor the formation of phase-segregated micron-sized rubidium halide crystals. This tolerance to higher loadings of potassium allows us to achieve superior luminescent properties with potassium passivation. We also find that exposure to a humid atmosphere drives phase segregation and grain coalescence for all compositions, with the rubidium-passivated sample showing the highest sensitivity to nonperovskite phase formation. Our work highlights the benefits but also the limitations of these passivation approaches in maximizing both optoelectronic properties and the stability of perovskite films.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Halide perovskites", "Luminescent property", "Moisture stability", "Optoelectronic properties", "Phase segregations", "Photovoltaic devices", "Potassium complex", "Precursor solutions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054668600", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55864987800": {"Name": "Abdi-Jalebi M.", "AuthorID": "55864987800", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "57022043200": {"Name": "Andaji-Garmaroudi Z.", "AuthorID": "57022043200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "56187429000": {"Name": "Pearson A.", "AuthorID": "56187429000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "8077782000": {"Name": "Friend R.", "AuthorID": "8077782000", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "35224069200": {"Name": "Stranks S.", "AuthorID": "35224069200", "AffiliationID": "60121115, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "14019558800": {"Name": "Divitini G.", "AuthorID": "14019558800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}, "56223584400": {"Name": "Cacovich S.", "AuthorID": "56223584400", "AffiliationID": "60121600", "AffiliationName": "Institut Photovoltaq Ue DIl E-de-France (IPVF) 30"}, "6603883362": {"Name": "Ducati C.", "AuthorID": "6603883362", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}, "55153330000": {"Name": "Philippe B.", "AuthorID": "55153330000", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University"}, "56373702800": {"Name": "Rensmo H.", "AuthorID": "56373702800", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University"}}}
