Most is known about the tumoricidal properties of cells bearing the V\u03b42 T cell receptor chain, but recent studies have demonstrated that cells with the V\u03b41 chain and those with neither V\u03b41 nor V\u03b42 chains have properties which may make them more attractive anticancer effectors in adoptive immunotherapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gamma-delta T cell", "Neuroblastoma", "Ovarian cancer", "Preclinical", "Vdelta-1"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954528267", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"56108105900": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "56108105900", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cancer, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "55731054400": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55731054400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Cancer, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57061688800": {"Name": "Kramer A.", "AuthorID": "57061688800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7005333544": {"Name": "Gustafsson K.", "AuthorID": "7005333544", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Section of Molecular and Cellular Immunology, UCL Institute of Child Health"}}}
