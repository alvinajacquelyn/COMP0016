The mechanisms by which this drug exerts its potentially toxic effects have been enumerated or postulated in recent studies.1 In many respects, the advances in our understanding of the actions of alcohol on a particular organ have occurred because investigators have been able to examine in vitro cells that have been exposed acutely or chronically to ethanol. These findings have then been applied to clinical situations to explain the pathophysiology of whole organ dysfunction.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053563737", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"6507590504": {"Name": "Ojeas H.", "AuthorID": "6507590504", "AffiliationID": "60029833", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Oklahoma Health Sciences Center"}, "7006865023": {"Name": "Harty R.", "AuthorID": "7006865023", "AffiliationID": "60029833", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Oklahoma Health Sciences Center"}, "35372621100": {"Name": "Van Thiel D.", "AuthorID": "35372621100", "AffiliationID": "60031531", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transplantation Medicine, Oklahoma Transplantation Institute"}}}
