We present a new consistency check based on the relative amplitude of non-relativistic galaxy peculiar motions, measured via redshift-space distortion, and the relativistic deflection of light by those same galaxies traced by galaxy-galaxy lensing. We take advantage of the latest generation of deep, overlapping imaging and spectroscopic data sets, combining the Red Cluster Sequence Lensing Survey, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey, the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We quantify the results using the 'gravitational slip' statistic EG, which we estimate as 0.48 \u00b1 0.10 at z = 0.32 and 0.30 \u00b1 0.07 at z = 0.57, the latter constituting the highest redshift at which this quantity has been determined. These measurements are consistent with the predictions of General Relativity, for a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric in a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant, which are EG = 0.41 and 0.36 at these respective redshifts. The combination of redshift-space distortion and gravitational lensing data from current and future galaxy surveys will offer increasingly stringent tests of fundamental cosmology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark energy", "Large-scale structure of universe", "Surveys"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964556700", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7102960950": {"Name": "Blake C.", "AuthorID": "7102960950", "AffiliationID": "60030804", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology"}, "24399008600": {"Name": "Joudaki S.", "AuthorID": "24399008600", "AffiliationID": "60030804", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology"}, "6701712657": {"Name": "Heymans C.", "AuthorID": "6701712657", "AffiliationID": "60110880, 60006858, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Universities Physics Alliance, Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory"}, "56511267600": {"Name": "Choi A.", "AuthorID": "56511267600", "AffiliationID": "60110880, 60006858, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Scottish Universities Physics Alliance, Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh, Royal Observatory"}, "6602464203": {"Name": "Erben T.", "AuthorID": "6602464203", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Argelander Institute for Astronomy, University of Bonn"}, "8833942900": {"Name": "Hildebrandt H.", "AuthorID": "8833942900", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Argelander Institute for Astronomy, University of Bonn"}, "8764087600": {"Name": "Nakajima R.", "AuthorID": "8764087600", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Argelander Institute for Astronomy, University of Bonn"}, "44561139800": {"Name": "Harnois-Deraps J.", "AuthorID": "44561139800", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of British Columbia"}, "57204260006": {"Name": "van Waerbeke L.", "AuthorID": "57204260006", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of British Columbia"}, "23485209600": {"Name": "Joachimi B.", "AuthorID": "23485209600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15841226500": {"Name": "Viola M.", "AuthorID": "15841226500", "AffiliationID": "60003878, 60019816", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Observatory, Leiden University"}}}
