In the absence of incoming sound, a fraction of the MET channels on top of the sensory hair cells are open, resulting in a sustained depolarizing current. By genetically manipulating the in vivo expression of molecular components of the MET apparatus, we show that during pre-hearing stages the MET current is essential for establishing the electrophysiological properties of mature inner hair cells (IHCs). If the MET current is abolished in adult IHCs, they revert into cells showing electrical and morphological features characteristic of pre-hearing IHCs, including the re-establishment of cholinergic efferent innervation. The MET current is thus critical for the maintenance of the functional properties of adult IHCs, implying a degree of plasticity in the mature auditory system in response to the absence of normal transduction of acoustic signals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Auditory Pathways", "Cells, Cultured", "Cholinergic Agents", "Cochlea", "Efferent Pathways", "Gerbillinae", "Hair Cells, Auditory, Inner", "Hearing", "Mechanotransduction, Cellular", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Stereocilia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054076484", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"36093709700": {"Name": "Corns L.F.", "AuthorID": "36093709700", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}, "7406330780": {"Name": "Johnson S.L.", "AuthorID": "7406330780", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}, "57204017314": {"Name": "Hendry A.", "AuthorID": "57204017314", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}, "55330877600": {"Name": "Ceriani F.", "AuthorID": "55330877600", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}, "6602070670": {"Name": "Marcotti W.", "AuthorID": "6602070670", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Science, University of Sheffield"}, "49461642200": {"Name": "Roberts T.", "AuthorID": "49461642200", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer"}, "57220381311": {"Name": "Ranatunga K.M.", "AuthorID": "57220381311", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer"}, "7004537631": {"Name": "Kros C.J.", "AuthorID": "7004537631", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer"}, "6602169613": {"Name": "Safieddine S.", "AuthorID": "6602169613", "AffiliationID": "60001772", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique et Physiologie de l\u2019Audition, Institut Pasteur"}, "7202973256": {"Name": "Petit C.", "AuthorID": "7202973256", "AffiliationID": "60010578", "AffiliationName": "Coll\u00e8ge de France"}, "7102712349": {"Name": "Steel K.P.", "AuthorID": "7102712349", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King\u2019s College London"}, "7006851428": {"Name": "Forge A.", "AuthorID": "7006851428", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, University College London"}, "7003958281": {"Name": "Furness D.N.", "AuthorID": "7003958281", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, Keele University"}}}
