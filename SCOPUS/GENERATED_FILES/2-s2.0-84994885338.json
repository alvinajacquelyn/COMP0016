Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 heterosexual solo mothers and 47 heterosexual mothers with partners to investigate their decisions and experiences about identifiable donation and disclosure to their children. No significant difference was found in the proportion of mothers in each family type who had told their children about their donor conception (solo mothers 54.8%; partnered mothers 36.2%). Of those who had not told, a significantly higher proportion of solo mothers than partnered mothers intended to disclose (P < 0.05). Partnered mothers were more likely than solo mothers to feel neutral, ambivalent or negative about having used an identifiable donor (P < 0.05), and were less likely to consider children's knowledge of their genetic origins as extremely important (P < 0.05). These findings are relevant to provision of counselling services as it cannot be assumed that parents will tell their children about their origins or their entitlement to request the identity of their donor at the age of 18 years. Further qualitative research would increase understanding of solo mothers' attitudes towards disclosure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disclosure", "donor insemination", "identifiable donors", "single mothers by choice", "solo mothers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision Making", "Disclosure", "Family Characteristics", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mothers", "Reproductive Techniques, Assisted", "Single-Parent Family", "Spermatozoa", "Tissue Donors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994885338", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"24168523400": {"Name": "Freeman T.", "AuthorID": "24168523400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57052627600": {"Name": "Zadeh S.", "AuthorID": "57052627600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "7006221075": {"Name": "Golombok S.", "AuthorID": "7006221075", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge"}, "57052122200": {"Name": "Smith V.", "AuthorID": "57052122200", "AffiliationID": "101475895", "AffiliationName": "The London Women's Clinic"}}}
