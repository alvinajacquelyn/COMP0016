{"Title": "The choice of embedding media affects image quality, tissue R2*, and susceptibility behaviors in post-mortem brain MR microscopy at 7.0T", "Year": 2019, "Source": "Magn. Reson. Med.", "Volume": "81", "Issue": 4, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 2688, "PageEnd": 2701, "CitedBy": 7, "DOI": "10.1002/mrm.27595", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85057769439&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in MedicinePurpose: The quality and precision of post-mortem MRI microscopy may vary depending on the embedding medium used. To investigate this, our study evaluated the impact of 5 widely used media on: (1) image quality, (2) contrast of high spatial resolution gradient-echo (T1 and T2*-weighted) MR images, (3) effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*), and (4) quantitative susceptibility measurements (QSM) of post-mortem brain specimens. Methods: Five formaldehyde-fixed brain slices were scanned using 7.0T MRI in: (1) formaldehyde solution (formalin), (2) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (3) deuterium oxide (D2O), (4) perfluoropolyether (Galden), and (5) agarose gel. SNR and contrast-to-noise ratii (SNR/CNR) were calculated for cortex/white matter (WM) and basal ganglia/WM regions. In addition, median R2* and QSM values were extracted from caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, WM, and cortical regions. Results: PBS, Galden, and agarose returned higher SNR/CNR compared to formalin and D2O. Formalin fixation, and its use as embedding medium for scanning, increased tissue R2*. Imaging with agarose, D2O, and Galden returned lower R2* values than PBS (and formalin). No major QSM offsets were observed, although spatial variance was increased (with respect to R2* behaviors) for formalin and agarose. Conclusions: Embedding media affect gradient-echo image quality, R2*, and QSM in differing ways. In this study, PBS embedding was identified as the most stable experimental setup, although by a small margin. Agarose and Galden were preferred to formalin or D2O embedding. Formalin significantly increased R2* causing noisier data and increased QSM variance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ex vivo imaging", "formaldehyde fixation", "post-mortem imaging", "quantitative susceptibility mapping", "ultra-high field MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ex vivo imaging", "High spatial resolution", "Phosphate-buffered salines", "Post mortem imaging", "Susceptibility mapping", "Susceptibility measurements", "Transverse relaxation rate", "Ultra-high field mris", "Aged", "Autopsy", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Contrast Media", "Deuterium Oxide", "Ethers", "Female", "Fluorocarbons", "Formaldehyde", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phosphates", "Sepharose", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Specimen Handling", "Tissue Embedding"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057769439", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"10042636600": {"Name": "Dusek P.", "AuthorID": "10042636600", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Charles University, 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "36145221300": {"Name": "Madai V.I.", "AuthorID": "36145221300", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Center for Stroke Research Berlin (CSB), Charit\u00e9-Universitaetsmedizin"}, "6602182155": {"Name": "Sobesky J.", "AuthorID": "6602182155", "AffiliationID": "60024629, 60026245, 60015188", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charit\u00e9-Universitaetsmedizin and Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC)"}, "56497051600": {"Name": "Huelnhagen T.", "AuthorID": "56497051600", "AffiliationID": "60024629, 60015188", "AffiliationName": "Berlin Ultrahigh Field Facility (B.U.F.F.), Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC)"}, "55075555700": {"Name": "Niendorf T.", "AuthorID": "55075555700", "AffiliationID": "60024629, 60026245, 60015188", "AffiliationName": "Experimental and Clinical Research Center (ECRC), Charit\u00e9-Universitaetsmedizin and Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC)"}, "6701445697": {"Name": "Bahn E.", "AuthorID": "6701445697", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuropathology, University Medicine G\u00f6ttingen"}, "6508384039": {"Name": "Matej R.", "AuthorID": "6508384039", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Charles University, 1st Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague"}, "8235719600": {"Name": "Acosta-Cabronero J.", "AuthorID": "8235719600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "16833920000": {"Name": "Wuerfel J.", "AuthorID": "16833920000", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, University Basel"}}}
