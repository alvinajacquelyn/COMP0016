When a patient becomes so severely ill that admission to a medical unit is required, the risk of a poor outcome is high. Most medical services do not have sufficient expertise, without psychiatric help, to manage the nutritional, medical, behavioural and family problems that often appear. These problems interact and this can adversely affect outcome. This article discusses, with reference to the MARSIPAN report, the procedure that should be followed when such a patient presents to an acute medical service. It considers diagnosis, risk assessment, consent, re-feeding syndrome, underfeeding syndrome and treat-ment-sabotaging behaviours. It stresses the importance of collaboration between expert medical and psychiatric staff, and involvement of the family. When these issues are adequately addressed, the outcome for the patient is more likely to be positive.
