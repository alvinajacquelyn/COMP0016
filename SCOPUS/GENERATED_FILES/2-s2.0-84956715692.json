Various radiographic signs may be seen on panoramic radiographs, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), or multislice CT (MSCT) like sclerosis, persisting alveolar sockets, and lack of bone fi lling in extractions sites, osteolysis, and sequestration. While panoramic radiographs serve as a baseline diagnostic tool, computed tomography (CT) or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide three-dimensional information of osteonecrotic lesions and may aid in assessing the extent of necrosis, monitoring the disease, and detecting early lesions. Anyway, no imaging modality is able to reliably depict the margins of a necrosis so far. CT and MRI offer a wide spectrum of fi ndings but those are often not very specifi c. In the future, nuclear medicine imaging like combined SPECT/CT or PET/CT may further improve the diagnosis of MRONJ by combining functional and anatomical information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956715692", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"26327069900": {"Name": "Probst F.", "AuthorID": "26327069900", "AffiliationID": "60000291", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital Munich (LMU)"}, "56305618400": {"Name": "Probst M.", "AuthorID": "56305618400", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich"}, "14627355000": {"Name": "Bisdas S.", "AuthorID": "14627355000", "AffiliationID": "60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen"}}}
