We therefore characterized longitudinally the immunological and virological features that may explain divergence in disease outcome in 70 HIV-1 C-clade-infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive South African adults, 35 of whom possessed protective HLA class I alleles. We demonstrate that, over 5 years of longitudinal study, 35% of individuals with protective HLA class I alleles lost viral control compared to none of the individuals without protective HLA class I alleles (P=0.06). Sustained HIV-1 control in patients with protective HLA class I alleles was characteristically related to the breadth of HIV-1 CD8+ T cell responses against Gag and enhanced ability of CD8+ T cells to suppress viral replication ex vivo. In some cases, loss of virological control was associated with reduction in the total breadth of CD8+ T cell responses in the absence of differences in HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell polyfunctionality or proliferation. In contrast, viremic controllers without protective HLA class I alleles possessed reduced breadth of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cell responses characterized by reduced ability to suppress viral replication ex vivo. These data suggest that the control of HIV-1 in individuals with protective HLA class I alleles may be driven by broad CD8+ T cell responses with potent viral inhibitory capacity while control among individuals without protective HLA class I alleles may be more durable and mediated by CD8+ T cell-independent mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Histocompatibility Antigens Class I", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic", "Viral Load", "Viremia", "Virus Replication"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982822058", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"36617167100": {"Name": "Koofhethile C.K.", "AuthorID": "36617167100", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "16426027600": {"Name": "Ndhlovu Z.M.", "AuthorID": "16426027600", "AffiliationID": "60009982, 60022195, 60029929", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University"}, "8349649900": {"Name": "Thobakgale-Tshabalala C.", "AuthorID": "8349649900", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "15750683100": {"Name": "Ismail N.", "AuthorID": "15750683100", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "14627623400": {"Name": "Mncube Z.", "AuthorID": "14627623400", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "36716627900": {"Name": "Mkhize L.", "AuthorID": "36716627900", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "15752356500": {"Name": "van der Stok M.", "AuthorID": "15752356500", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Programme, Doris Duke Medical Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "7402209193": {"Name": "Walker B.D.", "AuthorID": "7402209193", "AffiliationID": "60009982, 60022195, 60029929", "AffiliationName": "Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University"}, "7003741802": {"Name": "Goulder P.J.R.", "AuthorID": "7003741802", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Peter Medawar Building for Pathogen Research, University of Oxford"}, "57190739420": {"Name": "Ndung'ua T.", "AuthorID": "57190739420", "AffiliationID": "60022344", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology"}, "7102168846": {"Name": "Prado J.G.", "AuthorID": "7102168846", "AffiliationID": "60011805", "AffiliationName": "AIDS Research Institute Irsi Caixa, Hospital Universitari Germans"}, "55123243000": {"Name": "Yende N.", "AuthorID": "55123243000", "AffiliationID": "60094841", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa"}}}
