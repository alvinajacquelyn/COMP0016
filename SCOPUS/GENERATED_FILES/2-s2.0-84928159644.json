We evaluated the technical reproducibility of different types of assays for gene polymorphisms using DNA extracted from FFPE material. By using the MassARRAY iPLEX system, we investigated polymorphisms in DPYD (rs1801159 and rs3918290), UMPS (rs1801019), ERCC1 (rs11615), ERCC1 (rs3212986), and ERCC2 (rs13181) in 56 FFPE DNA samples. By using PCR, followed by size-based gel electrophoresis, we also examined TYMS 5\u2032 untranslated region 2R/3R repeats and GSTT1 deletions in 50 FFPE DNA samples and 34 DNAs extracted from fresh-frozen tissues and cell lines. Each polymorphism was analyzed by two independent runs. We found that iPLEX biomarker assays measuring single-nucleotide polymorphisms provided consistent concordant results. However, by using FFPE DNA, size-based PCR biomarkers (GSTT1 and TYMS 5\u2032 untranslated region) were discrepant in 32.7% (16/49, with exact 95% CI, 19.9%-47.5%; exact binomial confidence limit test) and 4.2% (2/48, with exact 95% CI, 0.5%-14.3%) of cases, respectively, whereas no discrepancies were observed using intact genomic DNA. Our findings suggest that DNA from FFPE material can be used to reliably test single-nucleotide polymorphisms. However, results based on size-based PCR biomarkers, and particularly GSTT1 deletions, using FFPE DNA need to be interpreted with caution. Independent repeated assays should be performed on all cases to assess potential discrepancies.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line", "DNA", "Formaldehyde", "Gene Dosage", "Genetic Markers", "Genotyping Techniques", "Humans", "Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis", "Paraffin", "Paraffin Embedding", "Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tissue Fixation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928159644", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"]], "AuthorData": {"37035583600": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "37035583600", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School"}, "34769387900": {"Name": "Tan P.", "AuthorID": "34769387900", "AffiliationID": "60031198", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Therapeutics and Stratified Oncology Group, Genome Institute of Singapore"}, "26538061400": {"Name": "Tan I.B.", "AuthorID": "26538061400", "AffiliationID": "60031809", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre"}, "55203525900": {"Name": "Sapari N.S.", "AuthorID": "55203525900", "AffiliationID": "60106362, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore"}, "9738714100": {"Name": "Soong R.", "AuthorID": "9738714100", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60106366", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, National University Health System"}, "6602510654": {"Name": "Grabsch H.I.", "AuthorID": "6602510654", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, GROW School for Oncology and Development Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center"}, "56600142200": {"Name": "Hewitt L.C.", "AuthorID": "56600142200", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "22950722000": {"Name": "Inam I.", "AuthorID": "22950722000", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "56387004900": {"Name": "Bottomley D.", "AuthorID": "56387004900", "AffiliationID": "60023959, 60012070", "AffiliationName": "Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "22980649600": {"Name": "Okines A.", "AuthorID": "22980649600", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "36103192800": {"Name": "Smyth E.C.", "AuthorID": "36103192800", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "36071300500": {"Name": "Cunningham D.", "AuthorID": "36071300500", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "7005624882": {"Name": "Wotherspoon A.", "AuthorID": "7005624882", "AffiliationID": "60011472", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "36960908700": {"Name": "Aoyama T.", "AuthorID": "36960908700", "AffiliationID": "60017631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center"}, "7402718437": {"Name": "Yoshikawa T.", "AuthorID": "7402718437", "AffiliationID": "60017631", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Kanagawa Cancer Center"}, "24177295600": {"Name": "Nankivell M.", "AuthorID": "24177295600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7003911215": {"Name": "Stenning S.P.", "AuthorID": "7003911215", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7004071111": {"Name": "Tsuburaya A.", "AuthorID": "7004071111", "AffiliationID": "60136491", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterological Center, Yokohama City University Medical Center"}}}
