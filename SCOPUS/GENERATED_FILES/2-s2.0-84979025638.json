We describe a principal component spatial filter algorithm for separation of the global and local effects. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using fNIRS signals acquired during a right finger-thumb tapping task where the response patterns are well established. Both the temporal waveforms and the spatial pattern consistencies between oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin signals are significantly improved, consistent with the basic physiological basis of fNIRS signals and the expected pattern of activity associated with the task.", "AuthorKeywords": ["finger thumb tapping", "functional near-infrared spectroscopy", "global component", "spatial filter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Functional near infrared spectroscopy", "Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fnirs)", "global component", "Principal Components", "Response patterns", "Spatial filterings", "Spatial filters", "Temporal waveforms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979025638", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (miscellaneous)", "NEUR", "2801"], ["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57188577368": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57188577368", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry"}, "36789839000": {"Name": "Noah J.", "AuthorID": "36789839000", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale School of Medicine, Department of Psychiatry"}, "35299240000": {"Name": "Hirsch J.", "AuthorID": "35299240000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}}}
