In this investigation, the authors have characterised the electrochemical performance of all-vanadium redox flow batteries by studying the effect of compression on the contact resistance, polarisation behaviour and efficiency. Contact resistance was seen to reduce from ca. 2.0 \u03a9 cm2 to 1.2 \u03a9 cm2 and an energy efficiency of 85% was obtained from a felt compressed to 75%. Moreover, X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been employed to study the microstructure of felt electrodes at compressions up to 70%, showing a linear decrease in porosity and a constant fibre surface area-to-volume ratio. The pressure drop was modelled using computational fluid dynamics and employing the 3D structure of the felts obtained from CT, revealing that a 60% increase in compression related to a 44.5% increase in pressure drop.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compression", "Contact resistance", "Energy storage", "Flow", "X-ray computed tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["All vanadium redox flow battery", "Carbon felt electrodes", "Electrochemical performance", "Electrolyte flows", "Flow", "Increase in pressure", "Polarisation behaviour", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994036961", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57199236850": {"Name": "Brown L.", "AuthorID": "57199236850", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Dept.
