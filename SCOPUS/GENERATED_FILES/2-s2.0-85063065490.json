In the English context, however, we argue that two related orthodoxies have prevailed\u2013\u2018employer engagement\u2019 and \u2018skills supply\u2019\u2013in which education providers have striven to gain employer involvement in their programmes and meet their skills needs. The effectiveness of these twin orthodoxies has been limited by the \u2018New Low Skills Equilibrium\u2019 (NLSE) involving a symbiosis of weaknesses on both the education and employer sides. The article draws on findings of a two-year research and development programme in East London which explored the process of education-employer partnership working to support inclusive growth in key economic sectors. The research suggested that this aim was best supported by processes of \u2018co-production\u2019 that actively involved both partners in attempting to address features of the NLSE. The research also pointed to constraining factors. The article concludes by identifying the conditions required for the realisation of co-production approaches that include the development of new collaborative structures\u2013High Progression and Skills Networks (HPSNs)\u2013involving a wide range of social partners at the local and regional levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education-employer partnerships", "employer engagement", "England", "further education colleges", "skills"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063065490", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"8147973500": {"Name": "Hodgson A.", "AuthorID": "8147973500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Post-14 Education and Work, UCL Institute of Education"}, "6603348633": {"Name": "Spours K.", "AuthorID": "6603348633", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Post-14 Education and Work, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57212224151": {"Name": "Smith D.", "AuthorID": "57212224151", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Post-14 Education and Work, UCL Institute of Education"}, "57207847619": {"Name": "Jeanes J.", "AuthorID": "57207847619", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Post-14 Education and Work, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
