To facilitate these medical advances, funding agencies are increasingly focusing on a translational \u201cpayoff\u201d within grant applications and larger programs. As this is the underlying promise of biomedical research\u2014delivering advances to public health to improve the quality of life\u2014such strategic initiatives are paramount. However, the process of taking experimental observations between model systems and human subjects can be extraordinarily frustrating. We brought together the collective expertise of our mouse and human immunology research programs to reverse engineer a clinical observation into a mouse model system. Our goal was to model (in mice) the age-related impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity response observed in humans, and then evaluate the efficacy of interventions to improve cutaneous immunity. We report here on what worked, what didn\u2019t, and what we learned along the way.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Delayed-type hypersensitivity", "Translational immunology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Disease Models, Animal", "Humans", "Hypersensitivity, Delayed", "Immunosenescence", "Mice", "Skin", "Skin Aging", "Species Specificity", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939898469", "SubjectAreas": [["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"24528760800": {"Name": "Smithey M.", "AuthorID": "24528760800", "AffiliationID": "60021334, 60021148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunobiology and the Arizona Center on Aging, University of Arizona College of Medicine"}, "17136184800": {"Name": "Uhrlaub J.", "AuthorID": "17136184800", "AffiliationID": "60021334, 60021148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunobiology and the Arizona Center on Aging, University of Arizona College of Medicine"}, "55714316700": {"Name": "Li G.", "AuthorID": "55714316700", "AffiliationID": "60021334, 60021148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunobiology and the Arizona Center on Aging, University of Arizona College of Medicine"}, "6701641820": {"Name": "Nikolich-Zugich J.", "AuthorID": "6701641820", "AffiliationID": "60021334, 60021148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunobiology and the Arizona Center on Aging, University of Arizona College of Medicine"}, "6507455433": {"Name": "Vukmanovic-Stejic M.", "AuthorID": "6507455433", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, University College London"}, "7006856048": {"Name": "Akbar A.", "AuthorID": "7006856048", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Immunology, University College London"}}}
