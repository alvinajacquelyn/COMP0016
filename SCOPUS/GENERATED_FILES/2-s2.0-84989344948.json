Vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) express a specific type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) from at least three different chemoreceptor gene families allowing sensitive and specific detection of chemosensory cues. These families comprise the V1r and V2r gene families as well as the formyl peptide receptor (FPR)-related sequence (Fpr-rs) family of putative chemoreceptor genes. In order to understand the physiology of vomeronasal receptor-ligand interactions and downstream signaling, it is essential to identify the biophysical properties inherent to each specific class of VSNs. The physiological approach described here allows identification and in-depth analysis of a defined population of sensory neurons using a transgenic mouse line (Fpr-rs3-i-Venus). The use of this protocol, however, is not restricted to this specific line and thus can easily be extended to other genetically modified lines or wild type animals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute slice preparation", "Electrophysiology", "Formyl peptide receptor", "Neuroscience", "Olfaction", "Patch-clamp", "Sensory neurons", "Vomeronasal organ"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Chemoreceptor Cells", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic", "Olfactory Mucosa", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "Tissue Culture Techniques", "Vomeronasal Organ"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989344948", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"56136518100": {"Name": "Ackels T.", "AuthorID": "56136518100", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "56509635400": {"Name": "Drose D.R.", "AuthorID": "56509635400", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}, "6603220421": {"Name": "Spehr M.", "AuthorID": "6603220421", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}}}
