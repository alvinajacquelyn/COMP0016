In particular, the workshop will focus on the rediscovery of the five senses, either alone or in a multimodal combination, and of the perceptual-motor abilities of our body. The one-day workshop is divided in two steps: first, participants will have the possibility to briefly present and discuss with the other attendees their research. Workshop candidates are requested to send a position paper, including a short biography and detailing their research interests and background. Second, participants will have the possibilities to explore and rediscover their sensorimotor abilities through several exercises and games abilities using a critical design approach. Interdisciplinary groups will be challenged to design and develop new interaction experience concepts using our natural 'tools'as prototyping tools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical design", "Embodied cognition", "Full-body interaction", "Multimodality", "Multisensory experience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Critical design", "Embodied cognition", "Full-body interaction", "Multi-modality", "Multisensory"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964838739", "SubjectAreas": [["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"55877170000": {"Name": "Matassa A.", "AuthorID": "55877170000", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Torino"}, "36163906600": {"Name": "Angelini L.", "AuthorID": "36163906600", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland"}, "36163969400": {"Name": "Caon M.", "AuthorID": "36163969400", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland"}, "8987147000": {"Name": "Mugellini E.", "AuthorID": "8987147000", "AffiliationID": "60024631", "AffiliationName": "University of Applied Sciences and Arts Western Switzerland"}, "22835490000": {"Name": "Obrist M.", "AuthorID": "22835490000", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "SCHI /Skai/ Lab., Creative Technology Research Group, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}}}
