The impact of this spill-in on hippocampal uptake was assessed using a novel partial volume correction method (PVC). Methods: PVC was performed on 20 [18F] flortaucipir dynamic PET scans (10 probable AD and 10 controls). Volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined for both hippocampus and CP. The correlation between hippocampal and CP distribution volume (VT), with and without PVC, was determined. Both anatomically defined and eroded VOIs were used. Results: For controls, the correlation between hippocampal and CP VT was significantly reduced after using PVC along with an eroded VOI (r2 = 0.59, slope = 0.80 versus r2 = 0.15, slope = 0.15; difference: p < 0.05). The same was true for AD patients (p < 0.05). Conclusion: PVC together with an optimized hippocampal VOI resulted in effective reduction of CP spill-in and improved accuracy of hippocampal VT.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051549467", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55673225600": {"Name": "Wolters E.", "AuthorID": "55673225600", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurology & Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center"}, "56354740800": {"Name": "Golla S.", "AuthorID": "56354740800", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "54783610200": {"Name": "Timmers T.", "AuthorID": "54783610200", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurology & Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center"}, "40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Lund University, Clinical Memory Research Unit"}, "57203386326": {"Name": "van der Weijden C.", "AuthorID": "57203386326", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "8575151100": {"Name": "Schuit R.", "AuthorID": "8575151100", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "6603561967": {"Name": "Windhorst A.", "AuthorID": "6603561967", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology & Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}, "23010938700": {"Name": "Yaqub M.", "AuthorID": "23010938700", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "7005884819": {"Name": "Lammertsma A.", "AuthorID": "7005884819", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "6701854037": {"Name": "Boellaard R.", "AuthorID": "6701854037", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "6603412407": {"Name": "van Berckel B.", "AuthorID": "6603412407", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurology & Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurology & Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center"}, "6701919055": {"Name": "Schwarte L.", "AuthorID": "6701919055", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthesiology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, VU University Medical Center"}}}
