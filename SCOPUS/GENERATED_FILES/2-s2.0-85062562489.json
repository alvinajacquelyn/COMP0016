We previously reported a large trial of anti-scarring treatment in combined phacotrabeculectomy surgery. Long-term outcomes in an African population are extremely rarely reported. We present here the outcomes in IOP, acuity, bleb morphology and patient perceptions at 3\u20135-years post surgery. Methods:: Tanzanian patients with glaucoma and visually significant cataract underwent combined phacotrabeculectomy surgery. In November 2015 an attempt was made to contact all participants in the study inviting them for a repeat examination. All who attended were given a detailed examination. A semi-structured interview in Swahili was administrated to determine patient experience and satisfaction with the surgery. Results:: Sixty-eight (23%) attended for repeat review in 2015. The mean time from original surgery was 4.5-years (range 2.3\u20136.6-years). Overall 53 (78%) had IOP < 21 mm Hg and 29 (43%) an IOP < 16 mm Hg at final follow-up. A flat bleb at 26 and 100 days was associated with failure by IOP criteria at 4.5-years post-operatively. A vascular bleb at those time points was not any more associated with late failure than a non-vascular bleb. A majority of patients were pleased with the surgery. The cost of surgery is high but it is a price patients were willing to pay. Nearly all patients (95%) would recommend the service to family and friends. Discussion:: Owing to the small proportion reviewed, our conclusions are severely limited. Phacotrabeculectomy worked well in a majority of the reviewed population long-term and is accepted by a majority of these patients as worthwhile.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cataract", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Incidence", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phacoemulsification", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies", "Tanzania", "Time Factors", "Trabeculectomy", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062562489", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57204296793": {"Name": "Murdoch I.", "AuthorID": "57204296793", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57197420535": {"Name": "Baker H.", "AuthorID": "57197420535", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "56814980500": {"Name": "Odouard C.", "AuthorID": "56814980500", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "57207456562": {"Name": "Kapessa I.", "AuthorID": "57207456562", "AffiliationID": "121225316", "AffiliationName": "Dr. Agarwal\u2019s Eye Hospital with Abu Baseer Specialist Eye clinic"}, "54388652700": {"Name": "Dhalla K.", "AuthorID": "54388652700", "AffiliationID": "121225316", "AffiliationName": "Dr. Agarwal\u2019s Eye Hospital with Abu Baseer Specialist Eye clinic"}, "8249895800": {"Name": "Clarke J.", "AuthorID": "8249895800", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
