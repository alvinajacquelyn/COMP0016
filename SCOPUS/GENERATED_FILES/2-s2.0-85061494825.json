Recently, microorganisms have been shown to passively exploit and alter these deposition dynamics to increase their survival chances under harshening conditions. Here, we show that, as the droplet evaporation rate slows down, bacterial mobility starts playing a major role in determining the growth dynamics of the edge of drying droplets. Such motility-induced dynamics can influence several biophysical phenomena, from the formation of biofilms to the spreading of pathogens in humid environments and on surfaces subject to periodic drying. Analogous dynamics in other active matter systems can be exploited for technological applications in printing, coating, and self-assembly, where the standard coffee-ring effect is often a nuisance.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biofilm formation", "Deposition dynamics", "Droplet evaporation", "Drying droplets", "Growth dynamics", "Humid environment", "Technological applications", "Thin-film depositions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061494825", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57195280042": {"Name": "Andac T.", "AuthorID": "57195280042", "AffiliationID": "60014808", "AffiliationName": "Soft Matter Lab, Department of Physics, Bilkent University"}, "57205301516": {"Name": "Weigmann P.", "AuthorID": "57205301516", "AffiliationID": "60014808", "AffiliationName": "Soft Matter Lab, Department of Physics, Bilkent University"}, "14828325400": {"Name": "Velu S.K.P.", "AuthorID": "14828325400", "AffiliationID": "60105969", "AffiliationName": "University of Information Science and Technology St. Paul the Apostle"}, "36621179900": {"Name": "Pin\u00e7e E.", "AuthorID": "36621179900", "AffiliationID": "60005398", "AffiliationName": "Department of Living Matter, AMOLF"}, "8374046000": {"Name": "Volpe G.", "AuthorID": "8374046000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Gothenburg"}, "56308473800": {"Name": "Callegari A.", "AuthorID": "56308473800", "AffiliationID": "60014808", "AffiliationName": "Soft Matter Lab, Department of Physics, Bilkent University"}, "55391086000": {"Name": "Volpe G.", "AuthorID": "55391086000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
