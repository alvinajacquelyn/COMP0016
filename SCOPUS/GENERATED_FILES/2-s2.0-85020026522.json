These forms of monitoring can be understood as a method of approaching students through the lens of positive psychology. Clearly, the relationship between schools, technology, and affect is not straightforward or benign. Yet, despite recent attention to the educational benefits of social and emotional intelligence, most educational discussions pay little critical attention to affect in terms of external interests regulating the behaviours and dispositions of students. This paper examines how student subjectivities are managed by the modulation of affect through online platforms in/for school. It is separated into three broad sections that capture the themes emerging as central to the relations between student populations and techniques of affectivity: sensation, intensity, and value. The paper concludes with a consideration of the implications that arise from how online technologies are used to mediate student subjectivities in secondary school.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020026522", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"]], "AuthorData": {"57188874072": {"Name": "Nemorin S.", "AuthorID": "57188874072", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Department of Media and Communications, London School of Economics and Political Science"}}}
