Setting Six regional recruitment centers in England and Wales. Design Cross-sectional epidemiological study. Methods Data were collected on sociodemographic factors and medical history; self-report on eyes/vision included reason for wearing optical correction, eye diseases, and treatment received (including refractive laser surgery). Mean spherical equivalent was used to categorize individuals as myopic (<-1.0 diopter) or hypertrophic (>+1.0 diopter). Results Between 2009 and 2010, 117 281 subjects recruited by UK Biobank undertook an ophthalmic assessment, including autorefraction. Of those with refractive error within a range eligible for laser refractive surgery (n = 60 352), 1892 (3.1%) reported having bilateral refractive surgery and 549 (0.9%) unilateral surgery. Frequency of bilateral surgery decreased with increasing age and was higher in women. Frequency did not vary with educational attainment or accommodation status but increased with income among working age adults. Social participation, for example, regular visits to a pub or social club, was more common among those who underwent surgery. Other eye conditions were reported by 28% of those reporting refractive surgery compared with 11% of those eligible for treatment but not reporting surgery. Conclusion This study provides information not available routinely on the frequency and distribution of laser refractive surgery in an adult UK population. A high frequency of ocular conditions conventionally considered contraindications to laser refractive surgery raises the possibility that extant guidance on patient selection may not be followed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Corneal Surgery, Laser", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Databases, Factual", "England", "Epidemiologic Studies", "Female", "Happiness", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Refraction, Ocular", "Refractive Surgical Procedures", "Sex Distribution", "Social Participation", "State Medicine", "Visual Acuity", "Wales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952877924", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"]], "AuthorData": {"57211811127": {"Name": "Cumberland P.M.", "AuthorID": "57211811127", "AffiliationID": "116190122", "AffiliationName": "Ulverscroft Vision Research Group"}, "57194476088": {"Name": "Chianca A.", "AuthorID": "57194476088", "AffiliationID": "116190122", "AffiliationName": "Ulverscroft Vision Research Group"}, "57191956020": {"Name": "Rahi J.S.", "AuthorID": "57191956020", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60172638, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital, NHS Foundation Trust, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
