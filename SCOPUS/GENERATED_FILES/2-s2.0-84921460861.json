Design Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Participants A total of 276 patients, including 143 in the AGV group and 133 in the BGI group. Methods Patients aged 18 to 85 years with previous intraocular surgery or refractory glaucoma and intraocular pressure (IOP) of \u226518 mmHg in whom glaucoma drainage implant (GDI) surgery was planned were randomized to implantation of an AGV or a BGI. Main Outcome Measures Surgical failure, IOP, visual acuity (VA), use of glaucoma medications, and complications. Results At 5 years, IOP (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) was 14.7\u00b14.4 mmHg in the AGV group and 12.7\u00b14.5 mmHg in the BGI group (P = 0.015). The number of glaucoma medications in use at 5 years (mean \u00b1 SD) was 2.2\u00b11.4 in the AGV group and 1.8\u00b11.5 in the BGI group (P = 0.28). The cumulative probability of failure during 5 years of follow-up was 44.7% in the AGV group and 39.4% in the BGI group (P = 0.65). The number of subjects failing because of inadequately controlled IOP or reoperation for glaucoma was 46 in the AGV group (80% of AGV failures) and 25 in the BGI group (53% of BGI failures; P = 0.003). Eleven eyes in the AGV group (20% of AGV failures) experienced persistent hypotony, explantation of implant, or loss of light perception compared with 22 eyes (47% of failures) in the BGI group. Change in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution VA (mean \u00b1 SD) at 5 years was 0.42\u00b10.99 in the AGV group and 0.43\u00b10.84 in the BGI group (P = 0.97). Conclusions Similar rates of surgical success were observed with both implants at 5 years. The BGI produced greater IOP reduction and a lower rate of glaucoma reoperation than the AGV, but the BGI was associated with twice as many failures because of safety issues.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Female", "Glaucoma", "Glaucoma Drainage Implants", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Intraoperative Complications", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Prosthesis Implantation", "Reoperation", "Tonometry, Ocular", "Trabeculectomy", "Treatment Failure", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921460861", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"7005066559": {"Name": "Budenz D.L.", "AuthorID": "7005066559", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of North Carolina"}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Genetics, Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6601927329": {"Name": "Gedde S.J.", "AuthorID": "6601927329", "AffiliationID": "60016686, 60029251, 60021519", "AffiliationName": "Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine"}, "35377384300": {"Name": "Feuer W.J.", "AuthorID": "35377384300", "AffiliationID": "60016686, 60029251, 60021519", "AffiliationName": "Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine"}, "57207533951": {"Name": "Schiffman J.", "AuthorID": "57207533951", "AffiliationID": "60016686, 60029251, 60021519", "AffiliationName": "Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami, Miller School of Medicine"}, "7103026228": {"Name": "Costa V.P.", "AuthorID": "7103026228", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Campinas"}, "24762334500": {"Name": "Godfrey D.G.", "AuthorID": "24762334500", "AffiliationID": "60074472", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Assoc. of Texas"}, "7003519598": {"Name": "Buys Y.M.", "AuthorID": "7003519598", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto"}}}
