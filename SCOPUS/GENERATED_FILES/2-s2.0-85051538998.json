We propose a finite-size-error correction scheme for bulk energy gaps calculated in finite cells subject to periodic boundary conditions. We show that finite-size effects are qualitatively different in two-dimensional materials, demonstrating the effect in a QMC calculation of the band gap and exciton binding energy of monolayer phosphorene. We investigate the fixed-node errors in diffusion Monte Carlo gaps evaluated with Slater-Jastrow trial wave functions by examining the effects of backflow transformations, and also by considering the formation of restricted multideterminant expansions for excited-state wave functions. For several molecules, we examine the importance of structural relaxation in the excited state in determining excited-state energies. We study the feasibility of using variational Monte Carlo with backflow correlations to obtain accurate excited-state energies at reduced computational cost, finding that this approach can be valid. We find that diffusion Monte Carlo gap calculations can be performed with much larger time steps than are typically required to converge the total energy, at significantly diminished computational expense, but that in order to alleviate fixed-node errors in calculations on solids the inclusion of backflow correlations is sometimes necessary.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051538998", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57195590075": {"Name": "Hunt R.", "AuthorID": "57195590075", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "55341206900": {"Name": "Szyniszewski M.", "AuthorID": "55341206900", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "8241383700": {"Name": "Drummond N.", "AuthorID": "8241383700", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "57203388432": {"Name": "Prayogo G.", "AuthorID": "57203388432", "AffiliationID": "60011375", "AffiliationName": "Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), School of Information Science"}, "6603499335": {"Name": "Maezono R.", "AuthorID": "6603499335", "AffiliationID": "60016648", "AffiliationName": "Computational Engineering Applications Unit, RIKEN"}}}
