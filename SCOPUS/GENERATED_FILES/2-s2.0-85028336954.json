In particular, the Q-learning algorithm is adopted for the maximization of the energy extraction in each sea state. The controller damping and stiffness coefficients are varied in steps, observing the associated reward, which corresponds to an increase in the absorbed power, or penalty, owing to large displacements. The generated power is averaged over a time horizon spanning several wave cycles due to the periodicity of ocean waves, discarding the transient effects at the start of each new episode. The model of a two-body point absorber is developed in order to validate the control strategy in both regular and irregular waves. In all analysed sea states, the controller learns the optimal damping and stiffness coefficients. Furthermore, the scheme is independent of internal models of the device response, which means that it can adapt to variations in the unit dynamics with time and does not suffer from modelling errors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Point absorber", "Q-learning", "Reactive control", "Reinforcement learning (RL)", "Wave energy converter (WEC)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Large displacements", "Point absorber", "Q-learning", "Q-learning algorithms", "Reactive control", "Regular and irregular waves", "Stiffness coefficients", "Wave energy converters"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028336954", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"]], "AuthorData": {"57191408791": {"Name": "Anderlini E.", "AuthorID": "57191408791", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus"}, "36936698000": {"Name": "Forehand D.", "AuthorID": "36936698000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Energy Systems, University of Edinburgh, Faraday Building"}, "55884327400": {"Name": "Bannon E.", "AuthorID": "55884327400", "AffiliationID": "119085479", "AffiliationName": "Wave Energy Scotland"}, "7102049849": {"Name": "Xiao Q.", "AuthorID": "7102049849", "AffiliationID": "60024724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Naval Architecture, Ocean and Marine Engineering, University of Strathclyde"}, "36449211600": {"Name": "Abusara M.", "AuthorID": "36449211600", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter, Penryn Campus"}}}
