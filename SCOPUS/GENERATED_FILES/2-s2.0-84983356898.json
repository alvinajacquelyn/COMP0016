Networks are becoming more complex, with a growing number of Equal Cost MultiPath (ECMP) and link bundles. Hence, some data-plane problems (e.g. silent packet dropping at one router) can hardly be detected with control-plane protocols or simple monitoring tools like ping or traceroute. In this paper, we propose a new technique, called SCMon, that enables continuous monitoring of the data-plane, in order to track the health of all routers and links. SCMon leverages the recently proposed Segment Routing (SR) architecture to monitor the entire network with a single box (and no additional monitoring protocol). In particular, SCMon uses SR to (i) force monitoring probes to travel over cycles; and (ii) test parallel links and bundles at a per-link granularity. We present original algorithms to compute cycles that cover all network links with a limited number of SR segments. Further, we prototype and evaluate SCMon both with simulations and Linux-based emulations. Our experiments show that SCMon quickly detects and precisely pinpoints data-plane problems, with a limited overhead.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous monitoring", "Force monitoring", "Interface cards", "Monitoring protocol", "Monitoring tools", "Network Monitoring", "Original algorithms", "Packet dropping"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983356898", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56878711000": {"Name": "Aubry F.", "AuthorID": "56878711000", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "ICTEAM, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "56266551200": {"Name": "Lebrun D.", "AuthorID": "56266551200", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "ICTEAM, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "35220581300": {"Name": "Vissicchio S.", "AuthorID": "35220581300", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "ICTEAM, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "57190487712": {"Name": "Khong M.", "AuthorID": "57190487712", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "ICTEAM, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "7003765149": {"Name": "Deville Y.", "AuthorID": "7003765149", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "ICTEAM, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}, "6602705725": {"Name": "Bonaventure O.", "AuthorID": "6602705725", "AffiliationID": "60000874", "AffiliationName": "ICTEAM, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain"}}}
