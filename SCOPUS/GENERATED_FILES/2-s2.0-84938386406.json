In this study, we took a qualitative approach to explore the views and attitudes of seven colleg5e directors in Israel. We show that motivation for internationalization is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by the college directors' personal characteristics as well as by the colleges' contextual factors. Moreover, it seems that second-tier colleges use internationalization to promote themselves towards the status of first-tier research universities. The study provides a first insight into the perceptions and motivations of Israeli educational institutions' leaders regarding the development of institutional-level internationalization strategies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["higher education", "internationalization", "Israel", "second tier higher education institutions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938386406", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"8667142200": {"Name": "Yemini M.", "AuthorID": "8667142200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Tel Aviv University"}, "56004048200": {"Name": "Sadeh E.", "AuthorID": "56004048200", "AffiliationID": "60005681", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, Tel Aviv University"}, "36104957400": {"Name": "Holzmann V.", "AuthorID": "36104957400", "AffiliationID": "60016941", "AffiliationName": "Holon Institute of Technology"}, "25633773000": {"Name": "De Wit H.", "AuthorID": "25633773000", "AffiliationID": "60103347", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Higher Education Internationalisation, UCSC, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences"}, "24296785900": {"Name": "Stavans A.", "AuthorID": "24296785900", "AffiliationID": "60093501", "AffiliationName": "Research Authority and English Department, Beit Berl College"}, "56747943900": {"Name": "Fadila D.", "AuthorID": "56747943900", "AffiliationID": "115508833", "AffiliationName": "Al-Qassami College"}}}
