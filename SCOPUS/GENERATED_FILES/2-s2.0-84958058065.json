Climate change impacts are simulated using projections from the 41 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models for the period 2071\u20132100 under the RCP4.5 scenario. Scenario results are compared to a 1971\u20132000 base line. Most climate models suggest declines in mean annual discharge although some predict increases. A large proportion suggest that the dry season experiences large declines in discharge, especially during the transition to the rising water period. Most models (>75%) suggest declines in annual minimum flows. This may have major implications for both current and planned hydropower schemes. There is greater uncertainty in projected changes in wet season and annual maximum discharges. Two techniques are investigated to reduce uncertainty in projections, but neither is able to provide more confidence in the simulated changes in discharge.", "AuthorKeywords": ["climate change", "CMIP5", "hydrological modelling", "Tocantins-Araguaia Basin", "uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Climate change impact", "CMIP5", "Coupled Model Intercomparison Project", "Hydrological modelling", "Semi distributed hydrological models", "Tocantins-Araguaia Basin", "uncertainty", "Uncertainty assessment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958058065", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"]], "AuthorData": {"57114144700": {"Name": "Ho J.", "AuthorID": "57114144700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}, "55551610200": {"Name": "Thompson J.", "AuthorID": "55551610200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}, "25635521800": {"Name": "Brierley C.", "AuthorID": "25635521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
