However, identifying the totality of cells belonging to such neuronal modules, the \"inputs\" and \"outputs,\" remains a major challenge. Here, we present the development of nanoengineered electroporation microelectrodes (NEMs) for comprehensive manipulation of a substantial volume of neuronal tissue. Combining finite element modeling and focused ion beam milling, NEMs permit substantially higher stimulation intensities compared to conventional glass capillaries, allowing for larger volumes configurable to the geometry of the target circuit. We apply NEMs to achieve near-complete labeling of the neuronal network associated with a genetically identified olfactory glomerulus. This allows us to detect sparse higher-order features of the wiring architecture that are inaccessible to statistical labeling approaches. Thus, NEM labeling provides crucial complementary information to dense circuit reconstruction techniques. Relying solely on targeting an electrode to the region of interest and passive biophysical properties largely common across cell types, this can easily be employed anywhere in the CNS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Dendrites", "Green Fluorescent Proteins", "Mice, Transgenic", "Microelectrodes", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Electron, Scanning", "Nanotechnology", "Neurons", "Olfactory Bulb", "Receptors, Odorant"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043344552", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57200694792": {"Name": "Schwarz D.", "AuthorID": "57200694792", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg"}, "12771747200": {"Name": "Kollo M.", "AuthorID": "12771747200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57201073477": {"Name": "Feinauer C.", "AuthorID": "57201073477", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg"}, "7102001633": {"Name": "Schaefer A.", "AuthorID": "7102001633", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "36086018100": {"Name": "Bosch C.", "AuthorID": "36086018100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "57201076507": {"Name": "Whiteley I.", "AuthorID": "57201076507", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "6602716645": {"Name": "Margrie T.", "AuthorID": "6602716645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "6603312232": {"Name": "Cutforth T.", "AuthorID": "6603312232", "AffiliationID": "60027565", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Columbia University Medical Center"}}}
