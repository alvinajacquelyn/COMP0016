Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. All rights reserved.Globally, IVF patients are routinely offered and charged for a selection of adjunct treatments and tests or 'add-ons' that they are told may improve their chance of a live birth, despite there being no clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of the add-on. Any new IVF technology claiming to improve live birth rates (LBR) should, in most cases, first be tested in an appropriate animal model, then in clinical trials, to ensure safety, and finally in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to provide high-quality evidence that the procedure is safe and effective. Only then should the technique be considered as 'routine' and only when applied to the similar patient population as those studied in the RCT. Even then, further pediatric and long-term follow-up studies will need to be undertaken to examine the long-term safety of the procedure. Alarmingly, there are currently numerous examples where adjunct treatments are used in the absence of evidence-based medicine and often at an additional fee. In some cases, when RCTs have shown the technique to be ineffective, it is eventually withdrawn from the clinic. In this paper, we discuss some of the adjunct treatments currently being offered globally in IVF laboratories, including embryo glue and adherence compounds, sperm DNA fragmentation, time-lapse imaging, preimplantation genetic screening, mitochondria DNA load measurement and assisted hatching. We examine the evidence for their safety and efficacy in increasing LBRs.We conclude that robust studies are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of any adjunct treatment or test before they are offered routinely to IVF patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adherence compounds", "Assisted hatching", "Embryo glue", "IVF adjuncts", "Live-birth rate", "Mitochondria load", "PGS", "RCT", "Sperm DNA fragmentation", "Time-lapse imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["DNA Fragmentation", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Fertilization in Vitro", "Humans", "Live Birth", "Male", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Rate", "Reproductive Techniques, Assisted", "Spermatozoa", "Time-Lapse Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018461834", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7402361999": {"Name": "Harper J.", "AuthorID": "7402361999", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Embryology, IVF and Reproductive Genetics, Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56267280000": {"Name": "Jackson E.", "AuthorID": "56267280000", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Law Department, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "7003648409": {"Name": "Sermon K.", "AuthorID": "7003648409", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Reproduction and Genetics, Vrije Universiteit Russel"}, "7201959888": {"Name": "Aitken R.J.", "AuthorID": "7201959888", "AffiliationID": "60010571", "AffiliationName": "Priority Research Centre for Reproductive Science, University of Newcastle"}, "55528349200": {"Name": "Harbottle S.", "AuthorID": "55528349200", "AffiliationID": "60016390", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge IVF, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "8782838300": {"Name": "Mocanu E.", "AuthorID": "8782838300", "AffiliationID": "60001707, 60000050", "AffiliationName": "Rotunda Hospital and RCSI"}, "7003502430": {"Name": "Hardarson T.", "AuthorID": "7003502430", "AffiliationID": "60101890", "AffiliationName": "Fertilitetscentrum, Carlanders Hospital"}, "56740103200": {"Name": "Mathur R.", "AuthorID": "56740103200", "AffiliationID": "60120605, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Department of Reproductive Medicine, Central Manchester University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "7007079290": {"Name": "Viville S.", "AuthorID": "7007079290", "AffiliationID": "118591219", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Parasitologie et Pathologie Tropicale, EA 7292"}, "7003808968": {"Name": "Vail A.", "AuthorID": "7003808968", "AffiliationID": "60003771, 60111801", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biostatistics, University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre"}, "7006287338": {"Name": "Lundin K.", "AuthorID": "7006287338", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Reproductive Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}}}
