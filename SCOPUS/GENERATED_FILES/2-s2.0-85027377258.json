Consistent with previous reports, fully relaxed (111)pc-BiFeO3 epitaxial films consisting of a single ferroelectric domain are found to comprise a submicron-scale mosaic of magnetoelastic domains, all sharing a common direction of the magnetic polarity, which is found to switch reversibly upon reversal of the ferroelectric polarization without any measurable change of the magnetoelastic domain population. A real-space polarimetry map of our device clearly distinguishes between regions of the sample electrically addressed into the two magnetic states with a resolution of a few tens of micron. Contrary to the general belief that the magneto-electric coupling in BiFeO3 is weak, we find that electrical switching has a dramatic effect on the magnetic structure, with the magnetic moments rotating on average by 90\u00b0 at every cycle.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrical switching", "Ferroelectric domains", "Ferroelectric polarization", "Magneto-elastic", "Magnetoelectric couplings", "Rotation directions", "Submicron scale", "X-ray magnetic scattering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027377258", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57191625860": {"Name": "Waterfield Price N.", "AuthorID": "57191625860", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55838510125": {"Name": "Johnson R.D.", "AuthorID": "55838510125", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "57191830751": {"Name": "Chmiel F.P.", "AuthorID": "57191830751", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "7005828246": {"Name": "Radaelli P.G.", "AuthorID": "7005828246", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Clarendon Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford"}, "56057964700": {"Name": "Bombardi A.", "AuthorID": "56057964700", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55272273500": {"Name": "Saenrang W.", "AuthorID": "55272273500", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "7006759486": {"Name": "Eom C.B.", "AuthorID": "7006759486", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}}}
