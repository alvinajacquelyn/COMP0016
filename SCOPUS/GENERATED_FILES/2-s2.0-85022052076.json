For the first time, this study explores a multi-scale imaging and modelling method to measure the tortuosity of an Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) electrode material with pore sizes spanning over hundreds of orders of magnitude. This analysis is normally challenging using image-based techniques, as pores of different sizes may not be easily resolved at the same time using X-ray computed tomography (CT). In this study, a tubular SOFC anode, fabricated by a phase inversion technique, is used to illustrate this approach. A heat flux analogy is used to simulate mass transport and the results show that the embedded large-scale finger-like pores can significantly improve mass transport by providing less tortuous pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electrode material", "Gas transport properties", "Image-based techniques", "Multi-scale imaging", "Orders of magnitude", "Phase inversion techniques", "Tortuosity factor", "X-ray computed tomography"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022052076", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57189994070": {"Name": "Lu X.", "AuthorID": "57189994070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55976146800": {"Name": "Taiwo O.", "AuthorID": "55976146800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57189988046": {"Name": "Bailey J.", "AuthorID": "57189988046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57044825000": {"Name": "Heenan T.", "AuthorID": "57044825000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56384645100": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "56384645100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "6505451560": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "6505451560", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}}}
