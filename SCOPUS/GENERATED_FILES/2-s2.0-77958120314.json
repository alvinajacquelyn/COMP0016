Since the beginning of the data collections there has been a steady increase in the number of cycles, pregnancies and babies reported annually. For data collection X, 57 centres participated, reporting on 5887 cycles to oocyte retrieval (OR), along with details of the follow-up on 1516 pregnancies and 1206 babies born. A total of 729 OR were reported for chromosomal abnormalities, 110 OR for sexing for X-linked diseases, 1203 OR for monogenic diseases, 3753 OR for preimplantation genetic screening and 92 OR for social sexing. Data X is compared with the cumulative data for data collections I-IX. \u00a9 2010 The Author.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ESHRE PGD Consortium", "fluorescence in situ hybridization", "PCR", "PGD", "preimplantation genetic screening"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-77958120314", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7402361999": {"Name": "Harper J.C.", "AuthorID": "7402361999", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "CRGH, UCLH"}, "6603804201": {"Name": "Coonen E.", "AuthorID": "6603804201", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "PGD Working Group Maastricht, Department of Clinical Genetics, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "6602395789": {"Name": "De Rycke M.", "AuthorID": "6602395789", "AffiliationID": "60069985", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Genetics, UZ Brussel"}, "6506908475": {"Name": "Harton G.", "AuthorID": "6506908475", "AffiliationID": "60005155", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and IVF Institute"}, "7003847954": {"Name": "Moutou C.", "AuthorID": "7003847954", "AffiliationID": "60008350", "AffiliationName": "Service de la Biologie de la Reproduction, SIHCUS-CMCO"}, "6602284567": {"Name": "Pehlivan T.", "AuthorID": "6602284567", "AffiliationID": "108379051", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Valenciano de Infertilidad (IVI)"}, "7004516215": {"Name": "Traeger-Synodinos J.", "AuthorID": "7004516215", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Medical Genetics, University of Athens, St Sophia's Children's Hospital"}, "24175125800": {"Name": "Van Rij M.C.", "AuthorID": "24175125800", "AffiliationID": "105468400", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Genetics, Academic Medical Hospital"}, "7004549331": {"Name": "Goossens V.", "AuthorID": "7004549331", "AffiliationID": "60081485", "AffiliationName": "ESHRE Central Office"}}}
