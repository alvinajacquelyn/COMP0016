Methods: Analyses of quantitative evaluation data from 91 participants and qualitative interviews and focus groups with 80 participants and 3 members of staff. Results: Key assumptions of the RCT, including how the delivery of the intervention was achieved and what the intervention involved, are explored. Data suggest that the intervention was delivered as planned with a high level of fidelity. Key uncertainties surrounding the project, in particular unanticipated challenges that had to be overcome during the RCT, are also discussed and simple recommendations for improvement are made. Conclusion: This process evaluation aims to illuminate the outcome and mechanisms data from the RCT and enable organisations or individuals to ascertain the feasibility of establishing their own creative classes for women with symptoms of PND.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arts in health", "mental health", "postnatal depression", "process evaluation", "singing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Creativity", "Depression, Postpartum", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Interviews as Topic", "Mothers", "Play and Playthings", "Process Assessment, Health Care", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Singing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041132354", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"55911947100": {"Name": "Fancourt D.", "AuthorID": "55911947100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "55602471100": {"Name": "Perkins R.", "AuthorID": "55602471100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London"}}}
