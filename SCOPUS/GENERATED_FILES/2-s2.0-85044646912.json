A comprehensive understanding of soundscape characteristics and quality requires efficient data collection and analysis methods. This paper describes Participatory Soundscape Sensing (PSS), a worldwide soundscape investigation and evaluation project. We describe the calibration method for sound pressure levels (SPL) measured by mobile phone, analyze the PSS's data temporal-spatial distribution characteristics, and discuss the impact of the participants\u2019 age and gender on the data quality. Furthermore, we analyze the sound comfort level relationships with each class of land use, sound sources, subjective evaluation, sound level, sound harmoniousness, gender, and age using over a year of shared data. The results suggest that PSS has distinct advantages in enhancing the amount and coverage of soundscape data. The PSS data distribution is closely related to the temporal pattern of the human work-rest schedule, population density, and the level of cyber-infrastructure. Adults (19\u201340 years old) are higher-quality data providers, and women exhibit better performance with respect to data integrity than men. Increasing the proportion of natural source sounds and reducing the proportion of human-made sources of sound is expected to enhance the sound comfort level. A higher proportion of sound harmoniousness leads to higher sound comfort, and the higher proportion of subjective evaluation sound level does not lead to decreased sound comfort. We suggest that the crowdsourcing data with participatory sensing will provide a new perspective in soundscape investigation, evaluation, and planning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Citizen science", "Environmental noise", "Participatory sensing", "Soundscape", "Urban"], "IndexKeywords": ["Citizen science", "Environmental noise", "Participatory Sensing", "Soundscapes", "Urban"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044646912", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"55154683200": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "55154683200", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57201406636": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57201406636", "AffiliationID": "120470896", "AffiliationName": "Xiamen Research Academy of Environmental Sciences"}, "6602429978": {"Name": "Haklay M.", "AuthorID": "6602429978", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Extreme Citizen Science Group, University College London"}}}
