The scattering properties of the probe were evaluated experimentally using THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS), and numerically using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method in order to identify resonant enhancement. Numerical measurements show that the indium probes exhibit enhanced scattering across the THz frequency range due to dipolar resonance, with a fractional bandwidth of 0.65 at 1.24 THz. We experimentally observe the resonant enhancement of the scattered field with a peak at 0.3 THz. To enable practical THz microscopy applications of these resonant probes, we also demonstrate a simple excitation scheme utilizing a THz source with radial polarization, which excites a radial mode along the length of the tip. Strong field confinement at the apex of the tip, as required for THz near-field microscopy, was observed experimentally.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Enhanced scattering", "Fractional bandwidths", "Near field microscopy", "Near-field scattering", "Resonant enhancements", "Scattering efficiency", "Scattering property", "THz time domain spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032905857", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57188976874": {"Name": "Siday T.", "AuthorID": "57188976874", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "55312030000": {"Name": "Natrella M.", "AuthorID": "55312030000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}, "7003451569": {"Name": "Mitrofanov O.", "AuthorID": "7003451569", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electronic and Electrical Engineering Department, University College London"}}}
