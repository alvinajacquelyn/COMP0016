We investigated whether ACEI use is associated with lower risk of frailty in a cohort of North American individuals. Methods: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative, a cohort study with 8 years of follow-up including community-dwelling adults with knee osteoarthritis or at high risk for this condition, were analyzed. ACEI use was defined through self-reported information and confirmed by a trained interviewer. Frailty was defined using the Study of Osteoporotic Fracture (SOF) index as the presence of at least two of the following criteria: (1) weight loss \u2265 5% between baseline and any subsequent follow-up visit; (2) inability to do five chair stands; and (3) low energy level according to the SOF definition. A multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to assess the association between ACEI use at baseline and incident frailty. The data were reported as relative risks (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The final sample consisted of 4295 adults (mean age 61.2 years, females 58.1%). At baseline, 551 participants (12.8%) used ACEI. After adjusting for 15 potential confounders, the use of ACEI was associated with a lower risk of frailty (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.53\u20130.99). The adjustment for the propensity score substantially confirmed these findings (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.54\u20130.996). Conclusion: ACEI use may be associated with a reduced risk of frailty in individuals with/at risk of knee osteoarthritis, suggesting a potential role for ACI in the prevention of frailty.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Frailty", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "North America", "Osteoarthritis, Knee", "Propensity Score", "Risk", "Self Report", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061278733", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "National Research Council, Neuroscience Institute, Aging Branch"}, "57203083453": {"Name": "Maggi S.", "AuthorID": "57203083453", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "National Research Council, Neuroscience Institute, Aging Branch"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60170475, 60000913", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "The Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "36718206600": {"Name": "Soysal P.", "AuthorID": "36718206600", "AffiliationID": "60104413", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Bezmialem Vakif University"}, "57193859754": {"Name": "Demurtas J.", "AuthorID": "57193859754", "AffiliationID": "117257908", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Department, Azienda USL Toscana Sud Est"}, "56715857800": {"Name": "Celotto S.", "AuthorID": "56715857800", "AffiliationID": "119772759", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care Department, Aziendale AAS3 Alto Friuli, Collinare, Medio Friuli"}, "57197741912": {"Name": "Koyanagi A.", "AuthorID": "57197741912", "AffiliationID": "60104561, 60001602", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM"}}}
