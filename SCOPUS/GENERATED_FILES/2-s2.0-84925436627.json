Usually, in these systems texture and depth maps of captured views are available at the user side, as they permit the rendering of intermediate virtual views. However, the virtual views' quality depends on the distance to the available views used as references and on their quality, which is generally constrained by the heterogeneous capabilities of the users. In this context, this work proposes an IMV scalable system, where views are optimally organized in layers, each one offering an incremental improvement in the interactive navigation quality. We propose a distortion model for the rendered virtual views and an algorithm that selects the optimal views' subset per layer. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed distortion model, and that the careful choice of reference cameras permits to have a graceful quality degradation for clients with limited capabilities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Interactive multiview video", "multiview video plus depth", "navigation range", "scalable representations", "view synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Incremental improvements", "Interactive navigations", "Multiview video", "Multiview video plus depths", "Quality degradation", "scalable representations", "Scalable systems", "View synthesis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925436627", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"]], "AuthorData": {"56102661500": {"Name": "De Abreu A.", "AuthorID": "56102661500", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "24725809400": {"Name": "Toni L.", "AuthorID": "24725809400", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "25650402100": {"Name": "Maugey T.", "AuthorID": "25650402100", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "7005865062": {"Name": "Frossard P.", "AuthorID": "7005865062", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL)"}, "13309300400": {"Name": "Thomos N.", "AuthorID": "13309300400", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex"}, "7201690397": {"Name": "Pereira F.", "AuthorID": "7201690397", "AffiliationID": "60004956", "AffiliationName": "Instituto Superior T\u00e8cnico (IST)"}}}
