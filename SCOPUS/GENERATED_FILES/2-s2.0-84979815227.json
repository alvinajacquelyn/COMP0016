Visual impairment has a broad impact on health, functioning and well-being. Unrecognised vision loss remains common, and screening interventions have yet to reduce its prevalence. An alternative approach is to enhance practitioners' skills in recognising undetected vision loss, by having a more detailed picture of those who are likely not to act on vision changes, report symptoms or have eye tests. This paper describes a qualitative technology development study to evaluate heuristics for recognition of undetected vision loss in older patients in primary care.METHOD: Using a previous modelling study, two heuristics in the form of mnemonics were developed to aid pattern recognition and allow general practitioners to identify potential cases of unreported vision loss. These heuristics were then analysed with experts. Findings It was concluded that their implementation in modern general practice was unsuitable and an alternative solution should be sort.", "AuthorKeywords": ["detect vision loss", "general practice", "heuristic", "primary care", "rules of thumb", "unreported visual loss"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Algorithms", "Heuristics", "Humans", "Primary Health Care", "Vision Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979815227", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Care Planning", "NURS", "2904"]], "AuthorData": {"57190414914": {"Name": "Wijeyekoon S.", "AuthorID": "57190414914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "3Professor of Primary Care for Older People, Research Department of Primary Care &amp; Population Health, University College London"}, "6507886105": {"Name": "Kharicha K.", "AuthorID": "6507886105", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "3Professor of Primary Care for Older People, Research Department of Primary Care &amp; Population Health, University College London"}, "23050302300": {"Name": "Iliffe S.", "AuthorID": "23050302300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "3Professor of Primary Care for Older People, Research Department of Primary Care &amp; Population Health, University College London"}}}
