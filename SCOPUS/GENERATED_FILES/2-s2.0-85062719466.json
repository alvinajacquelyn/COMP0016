Moreover, NTRK1-pY674/pY675 together with low levels of PTPN6 and TP53 expression is associated with favorable disease-free survival of breast cancer patients. We determined whether in neuroblastoma this protein expression pattern impacts relapse-free survival (RFS). NTRK1-pY674/pY675, PTPN6, and TP53 expression was assessed in 98 neuroblastoma samples by immunohistochemistry. Association between expression levels and RFS was investigated by multivariate and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Mutant or wild-type TP53 was identified by sequencing tumor DNA. Tumors expressing NTRK1-pY674/pY675 and low or undetectable levels of PTPN6 and TP53 were significantly associated with 5-year RFS (P = .014) when the dataset was stratified by MYCN amplification, segmental chromosomal abnormalities and histology. Similar results were observed with tumors expressing wild-type TP53, NTRK1-pY674/pY675 and low or undetectable levels of PTPN6. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significant correlation (P = .004), with a 50% probability of RFS (median survival 4.73 years) when present compared with 19.51% (median survival 11.63 months) when absent. Similar results were seen with non-amplified MYCN or unfavorable/undifferentiating samples and tumors from patients aged 18 months or less. Importantly, NTRK1-pY674/pY675 is an independent predictor of improved RFS. These results strongly suggest that NTRK1-pY674/pY675 together with wild-type TP53 and undetectable or low levels of PTPN6 expression is a potential biomarker of improved RFS of neuroblastoma patients. The predictive value of NTRK1-pY674/pY675 together with wild-type TP53 and low PTPN6 expression could contribute to neuroblastoma patient prognosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Childhood cancer", "Neuroblastoma", "NTRK1", "PTPN6", "TP53"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease-Free Survival", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Immunohistochemistry", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Neuroblastoma", "Phosphorylation", "Prognosis", "Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6", "Receptor, trkA", "Survival Rate", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062719466", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"]], "AuthorData": {"55748108400": {"Name": "Youssef G.", "AuthorID": "55748108400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cell Biology and Cutaneous Research, The Blizard Institute Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "14051409900": {"Name": "Chagtai T.", "AuthorID": "14051409900", "AffiliationID": "60008323", "AffiliationName": "Haemaglobinopathy Department, Haematology Laboratory, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "57190071797": {"Name": "Barton J.", "AuthorID": "57190071797", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57200993348": {"Name": "Edwards D.", "AuthorID": "57200993348", "AffiliationID": "60012754, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Haematology and Brain Trials Cancer Research UK and UCL Cancer Trials Centre"}, "55731054400": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55731054400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6701526070": {"Name": "Montano X.", "AuthorID": "6701526070", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Program, UCL, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003742162": {"Name": "Gillett C.", "AuthorID": "7003742162", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "KHP Cancer Biobank, School of Cancer and Pharmaceutical Sciences, King's College London, Guy's New Hunt's House, Guy's Campus"}, "6602875803": {"Name": "Rampling D.", "AuthorID": "6602875803", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "56387646400": {"Name": "Virasami A.", "AuthorID": "56387646400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57049165000": {"Name": "Sebire N.", "AuthorID": "57049165000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
