By breaking the symmetry of a split ring resonator, two asymmetric resonances are excited from a dipole resonance, which enhance both the absorption and Q-factor. With the integration of four different ASRs into one unit cell, a broadband absorber experimentally obtained a 0.82-THz bandwidth with absorptivity of more than 0.9, which is 3.4 times as wide as the 0.24-THz bandwidth of the symmetric dipole peak. The proposed broadband absorber has great application potentials in the THz spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymmetry", "broadband", "metamaterials", "perfect absorption", "terahertz"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymmetry", "broadband", "Broadband absorbers", "Broadband terahertz", "Dipole resonances", "Metamaterial absorbers", "Split ring resonator", "Tera Hertz"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984806841", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55142775000": {"Name": "Wen Y.", "AuthorID": "55142775000", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Micro/Nano Fabrication, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University"}, "57209819097": {"Name": "Ma W.", "AuthorID": "57209819097", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Micro/Nano Fabrication, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University"}, "7404115157": {"Name": "Yu X.", "AuthorID": "7404115157", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Micro/Nano Fabrication, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University"}, "36674706400": {"Name": "Bailey J.", "AuthorID": "36674706400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "14058491500": {"Name": "Matmon G.", "AuthorID": "14058491500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
