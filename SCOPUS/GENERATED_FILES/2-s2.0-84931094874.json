The paper explores the specificity and generality of performativity as a particular contemporary mode of power relations. It addresses our own imbrication in the politics of performative truths, through our ordinary everyday life and work. The paper is about the here and now, us, you and me, and who we are in neoliberal education. It draws upon and considers a set of ongoing email exchanges with a small group of teachers who are struggling with performativity. It enters the \u2018theoretical silence\u2019 of governmentality studies around the issues of resistance and contestation. Above all, the paper attempts to articulate the risks of refusal through Foucault\u2019s notion of fearless speech or truth-telling (parrhesia).", "AuthorKeywords": ["neoliberalism", "parrhesia", "refusal"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931094874", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"7202536805": {"Name": "Ball S.", "AuthorID": "7202536805", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, UCL"}}}
