Proof-of-concept experiments are performed using a 1.2Gb/s OOK (NRZ) transmission over SMF-MMF-SMF link without or including 60GHz photonic up-conversion to be used on a wireless link (PON bridge) and fiber post transmission, or a 5Gb/s at 60GHz carrier MB-OFDM transmission over SMF-MMF-SMF link co-existing with 1.2Gb/s OOK (NRZ) signal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["mm-wave PON bridge", "multimode fiber", "radio over fiber"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost-efficient", "Mm waves", "Multi-mode fibers (MMF)", "Photonic up-conversion", "Proof of concept", "Wireless access", "Wireless bridges", "Wireless link"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963934384", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"7801636324": {"Name": "Mikroulis S.", "AuthorID": "7801636324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "56114372900": {"Name": "Thakur M.", "AuthorID": "56114372900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "8207205100": {"Name": "Mitchell J.", "AuthorID": "8207205100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}}}
