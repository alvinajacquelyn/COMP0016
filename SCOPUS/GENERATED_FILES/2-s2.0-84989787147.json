Uptake is initially observed at the spheroid periphery but extends to the spheroid core within 30 min. Using agarose gels as a three-dimensional model, the conversion of Z(trans)\u2192E(cis) via two-photon photoisomerization is demonstrated and the location of this photochemical process may be precisely selected within the micron scale in all three dimensions at depths up to almost 2 mm. We discuss these results for enhanced tissue penetration at longer near-infrared wavelengths for cancer therapy and up to three-photon excitation and imaging using 930-nm laser pulses with suitable combretastatin analogs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Bibenzyls", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton", "Photons", "Spheroids, Cellular", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989787147", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56236453800": {"Name": "Scherer K.M.", "AuthorID": "56236453800", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Oxford"}, "7003792023": {"Name": "Bisby R.H.", "AuthorID": "7003792023", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Oxford"}, "6602979966": {"Name": "Botchway S.W.", "AuthorID": "6602979966", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Oxford"}, "7006234461": {"Name": "Hadfield J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006234461", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Oxford"}, "35237001100": {"Name": "Haycock J.W.", "AuthorID": "35237001100", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Oxford"}, "7403267977": {"Name": "Parker A.W.", "AuthorID": "7403267977", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Central Laser Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Oxford"}}}
