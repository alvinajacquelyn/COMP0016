Here, methodological concerns that apply to non-destructive, surface examination with XRF instruments of ancient metal artefacts are discussed based on the comparative analyses of a set of copper-based objects by means of portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) and electron probe microanalyser (EPMA). The analytical investigation aims to explore issues of instrument comparability and reliability of the non-invasive pXRF results. The different analytical approaches produce a comparable pattern for the major element concentrations, but substantial variation is evident when it comes to the absolute values for major and minor/trace elements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Copper-alloys", "Electron probe microanalyser", "Museum artefacts", "X-ray fluorescence spectrometry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942312726", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"56871252500": {"Name": "Orfanou V.", "AuthorID": "56871252500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar, Education City"}}}
