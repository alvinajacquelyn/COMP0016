To assess their impact at micro and macroscopic level, multi-resolution imaging techniques that provide high quality images without sample alteration and in 3D are necessary: requirements not fulfilled by most of current methods. In this paper, we take advantage of the non-destructive time-efficient 3D multiscale capabilities of synchrotron Propagation-based X-Ray Phase Contrast Imaging (PB-X-PCI) to study a wide range of cardiac tissue characteristics in one healthy and three different diseased rat models. With a dedicated image processing pipeline, PB-X-PCI images are analysed in order to show its capability to assess different cardiac tissue components at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. The presented technique evaluates in detail the overall cardiac morphology, myocyte aggregate orientation, vasculature changes, fibrosis formation and nearly single cell arrangement. Our results agree with conventional histology and literature. This study demonstrates that synchrotron PB-X-PCI, combined with image processing tools, is a powerful technique for multi-resolution structural investigation of the heart ex-vivo. Therefore, the proposed approach can improve the understanding of the multiscale remodelling processes occurring in CVDs, and the comprehensive and fast assessment of future interventional approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic beta-Agonists", "Animals", "Coronary Vessels", "Disease Models, Animal", "Heart", "Heart Failure", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Isoproterenol", "Ligation", "Male", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Rats", "Rats, Inbred SHR", "Rats, Inbred WKY", "Rats, Wistar", "Synchrotrons", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065307214", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57188694519": {"Name": "Dejea H.", "AuthorID": "57188694519", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University and ETH Zurich"}, "54909987700": {"Name": "Stampanoni M.", "AuthorID": "54909987700", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University and ETH Zurich"}, "52463234100": {"Name": "Bonnin A.", "AuthorID": "52463234100", "AffiliationID": "60020195", "AffiliationName": "Paul Scherrer Institut"}, "54388912000": {"Name": "Garcia-Canadilla P.", "AuthorID": "54388912000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005275311": {"Name": "Bijnens B.", "AuthorID": "7005275311", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA"}, "37078948800": {"Name": "Cook A.C.", "AuthorID": "37078948800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35740490100": {"Name": "Guasch E.", "AuthorID": "35740490100", "AffiliationID": "112828964", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red - Cardiovascular (CIBER-CV)"}, "57213878385": {"Name": "Zamora M.", "AuthorID": "57213878385", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "BCNatal, Hospital Cl\u00ednic and Hospital Sant Joan de D\u00e9u"}, "8923628700": {"Name": "Crispi F.", "AuthorID": "8923628700", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60085100", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomedical Research on Rare Diseases (CIBER-ER), Hospital Cl\u00ednic"}}}
