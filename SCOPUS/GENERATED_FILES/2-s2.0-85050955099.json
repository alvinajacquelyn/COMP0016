Data are lacking from anatomically precise electrophysiological recordings in the most widely studied nodes of human brain networks. Here we used a combination of fMRI and electrocorticography (ECoG) in five human neurosurgical patients with electrodes in the canonical \u201cdefault\u201d (medial prefrontal and posteromedial cortex), \u201cdorsal attention\u201d (frontal eye fields and superior parietal lobule), and \u201cfrontoparietal control\u201d (inferior parietal lobule and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) networks. In this unique cohort, simultaneous intracranial recordings within these networks were anatomically matched across different individuals. Within each network and for each individual, we found a positive, and reproducible, spatial correlation for FC measures obtained from resting-state fMRI and separately recorded ECoG in the same brains. This relationship was reliably identified for electrophysiological FC based on slow (<1 Hz) fluctuations of high-frequency broadband (70\u2013170 Hz) power, both during wakeful rest and sleep. A similar FC organization was often recovered when using lower-frequency(1\u201370Hz)power,but anatomical specificity and consistency were greatest for the high-frequency broadband range. An interfrequency comparison of fluctuations in FC revealed that high and low-frequency ranges often temporally diverged from one another, suggesting that multiple neurophysiological sources may underlie variations in FC. Together, our work offers a generalizable electrophysiological basis for intrinsic FC and its dynamics across individuals, brain networks, and behavioral states.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Default mode network", "Dorsal attention network", "Dynamic functional connectivity", "Electrocorticography", "Resting-state fMRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Brain", "Brain Waves", "Connectome", "Electrocorticography", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050955099", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"35784499500": {"Name": "Kucyi A.", "AuthorID": "35784499500", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University"}, "37097989200": {"Name": "Schrouff J.", "AuthorID": "37097989200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "18533510200": {"Name": "Bickel S.", "AuthorID": "18533510200", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University"}, "7003443688": {"Name": "Parvizi J.", "AuthorID": "7003443688", "AffiliationID": "60012708", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University"}, "36857329800": {"Name": "Foster B.L.", "AuthorID": "36857329800", "AffiliationID": "60002441", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Neurosurgery and Neuroscience, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "57205317010": {"Name": "Shine J.M.", "AuthorID": "57205317010", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Mind Center, The University of Sydney"}}}
