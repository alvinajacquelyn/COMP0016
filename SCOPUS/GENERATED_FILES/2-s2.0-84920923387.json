The aim of this prospective study was to examine demographic and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) factors that might be associated with recovery and side effects. We also described the changes in HRQOL during the donation process. In total, 275 peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) and 37 bone marrow (BM) consecutive donors completed the SF-36 questionnaire predonation and 4weeks, and 3months postdonation. Predonation HRQOL markers were the strongest predictors of time to recovery. Poorer predonation physical health was associated with longer recovery (. P=.017) and certain side effects in PBSC donors. Poorer predonation mental health was associated with longer recovery in BM donors (. P=.03) and pain after PBSC donation (. P=.003). Physical HRQOL scores declined significantly from predonation to 4weeks postdonation. This was shown both for PBSC and BM donors (. P<.001 and P=.009, respectively), but the decline was much greater for BM donors. There was a return to predonation HRQOL values 3months after donation in both groups with values well above the mean of the general population (. P<.001).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone marrow", "Donation experience", "Health-related quality of life", "Peripheral blood stem cells"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Convalescence", "Female", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Pain", "Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Research Design", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Factors", "Tissue Donors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920923387", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"6506791341": {"Name": "Billen A.", "AuthorID": "6506791341", "AffiliationID": "60020641, 60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute and Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "7007032979": {"Name": "Madrigal J.A.", "AuthorID": "7007032979", "AffiliationID": "60020641, 60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute and Anthony Nolan Research Institute"}, "7202493348": {"Name": "Shaw B.E.", "AuthorID": "7202493348", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "56079439400": {"Name": "Strydom A.", "AuthorID": "56079439400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Mental Health Sciences Unit"}, "7003798294": {"Name": "Szydlo R.M.", "AuthorID": "7003798294", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College London"}, "7005689549": {"Name": "Switzer G.E.", "AuthorID": "7005689549", "AffiliationID": "60015543, 60014232", "AffiliationName": "Department of General Internal Medicine, University of Pittsburgh and Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System"}}}
