All rights reserved.More accurate non-participatory parameters and psychoacoustics to assess human perceptual responses to the acoustic environment are critical to inform effective urban sound planning and applied soundscape practice. Non-participatory observation methods are widely used by experts to capture animal behavior. In 2012, Lavia and Witchel applied these principles and methodologies for the first time to capturing and assessing human behavior \"in the wild\" to changes to the acoustic environment using added sound and music interventions in a clubbing district. Subsequent work was conducted with Aletta and Kang and Healey, Howes, Steffens, and Fiebig to begin characterizing the acoustic environment and human responses to align the perceptual and physical findings. Here, the authors report on new work and analysis and propose a preliminary predictive agile applied soundscape framework using non-participatory observation methods and psychoacoustics to be used with environmental assessment practice and evolving urban soundscape planning methods by researchers, practitioners, and policy makers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045794218", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"55847224200": {"Name": "Lavia L.", "AuthorID": "55847224200", "AffiliationID": "113858900", "AffiliationName": "The Noise Abatement Society"}, "6701510625": {"Name": "Witchel H.", "AuthorID": "6701510625", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "55557756700": {"Name": "Aletta F.", "AuthorID": "55557756700", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield"}, "7103195537": {"Name": "Steffens J.", "AuthorID": "7103195537", "AffiliationID": "60011604", "AffiliationName": "Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "15756802000": {"Name": "Fiebig A.", "AuthorID": "15756802000", "AffiliationID": "60096386", "AffiliationName": "HEAD Acoustics"}, "55056105000": {"Name": "Howes C.", "AuthorID": "55056105000", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "University of Gothenburg"}, "7004324758": {"Name": "Healey P.", "AuthorID": "7004324758", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}}}
