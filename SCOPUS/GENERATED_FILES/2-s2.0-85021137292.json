Method The case notes of 200 people who had failed to initially attend the service or subsequent follow up from 2005 to 2013 were reviewed. Results Clinical outcomes were determined for 152 people, with the remaining 48 having left the area. For those not attending at all, 64% had no further recorded events, a further 22% came under alternative specialist care and were managed appropriately, 6% were already in remission at the time of referral or at follow up and stayed seizure free. For people attending, but were subsequently lost to follow up, 78% were in remission, had improved seizure frequency, and normal pregnancies. In total 6% of those with poor control came under subsequent Neurological care. Conclusion This study suggests that for the majority of people who fail to attend or are lost to follow up in a primary care specialist epilepsy clinic, the primary reasons appear to be that they had no further events, improved seizure control or that seizure remission has been achieved. The majority with persistent poor control came under Neurological care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Case note review", "Epilepsy", "Non-attendance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Patient Dropouts", "Remission, Spontaneous"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021137292", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6507830340": {"Name": "Minshall I.", "AuthorID": "6507830340", "AffiliationID": "118681409", "AffiliationName": "Northgate Village Surgery, Fountains Health"}, "23670784300": {"Name": "Neligan A.", "AuthorID": "23670784300", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University, University of London"}}}
