The representative electrodes delivered excellent areal specific capacitance of 693.0 mF cm-2 at 5 mV s-1 in a three electrode testing system, good rate capability of ~ 78% retention when the scan rate increased 10 times and superior cycling stability with ~ 91% capacitance retention after 20,000 cycles. The self-standing electrodes were manufactured for flexible asymmetric supercapacitors and assembled into coin cells with ionic electrolyte for high working voltage applications. The primary origins for the outperformance of W2N over WO3-x in acid aqueous electrolytes are uncovered by electrochemical analysis, simulation work and in-situ transmission electron microscope (TEM). This discovery paved the way of exploring and designing advanced metal nitride electrode materials for supercapacitors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition", "Density Functional Theory", "In-situ transmission electron microscope", "Supercapacitor", "Tungsten nitride"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Asymmetric supercapacitor", "Capacitance retention", "Core shell structure", "Electrochemical analysis", "In-situ transmission", "Specific capacitance", "Tungsten nitride"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024486370", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56645908100": {"Name": "Ling M.", "AuthorID": "56645908100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56328578400": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "56328578400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55865504200": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55865504200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57219170078": {"Name": "Xiao Guo Z.", "AuthorID": "57219170078", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Christopher Ingold Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57194973409": {"Name": "Abou El Amaiem D.I.", "AuthorID": "57194973409", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "12802385800": {"Name": "Ji S.", "AuthorID": "12802385800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57194974401": {"Name": "Ryan Wang F.", "AuthorID": "57194974401", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "55242974300": {"Name": "Shao Y.", "AuthorID": "55242974300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Graphene Center, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "51763877800": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "51763877800", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "57089312600": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "57089312600", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "24475575100": {"Name": "Zou R.", "AuthorID": "24475575100", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}}}
