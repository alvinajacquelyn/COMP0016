This perspective paper looks at its potential uses in the context of high value and mostly low volume botanical material traded globally and used as medicines, health foods, in cosmetics and other applications. We offer a perspective on key areas in the supply of such products globally and how blockchain systems may help in sustainable sourcing, quality assurance, and in tackling supply problems in cases of complex multiherbal preparations. Both open and closed blockchain systems are feasible, and it seems likely that, at least in the initial development, closed ones are the main ones to be utilized. While blockchain's potential is not yet clear, the examples presented here highlight the opportunities of this new technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blockchain", "Herbal medicines", "Quality (herbal medicines)", "Sustainability", "Traditional medicines", "Value chains"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068414474", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"16156235300": {"Name": "Heinrich M.", "AuthorID": "16156235300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57200515228": {"Name": "Scotti F.", "AuthorID": "57200515228", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55023012200": {"Name": "Booker A.", "AuthorID": "55023012200", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Westminster"}, "57209652841": {"Name": "Kum K.Y.", "AuthorID": "57209652841", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57207686188": {"Name": "L\u00f6bel K.", "AuthorID": "57207686188", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57209655305": {"Name": "Fitzgerald M.", "AuthorID": "57209655305", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "School of Life Sciences, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Westminster"}}}
