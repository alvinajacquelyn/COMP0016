Published by Routledge.This article examines what has happened to training in public sector organisations in the UK in a period of austerity. It draws on individual-level data collected over the period 2000\u20132012 and establishment-level data collected from employer surveys carried out between 2005 and 2012. To understand these data further, 75 qualitative interviews with public sector employers were carried out between mid-2010 and early 2012. This article finds that while training incidence remained relatively high in the public sector, establishment-level control over planning and funding fell faster than in the private sector. Nevertheless, the public sector ethos of serving the community along with the tradition of the public sector as a \u2018good employer\u2019 meant that the training system within public sector organisations remained largely intact, even when the availability or frequency of some courses was reduced. The result was that limited training funds were made to go further by reducing the frequency of courses, prioritising courses immediately relevant to front-line services, tightening the application of eligibility criteria among potential trainees and economising on training delivery \u2013 summed up by one respondent as \u2018training smarter\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["austerity", "public sector", "recession", "training"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926248534", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Public Administration", "SOCI", "3321"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"6603656600": {"Name": "Jewson N.", "AuthorID": "6603656600", "AffiliationID": "60170433, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "6701751604": {"Name": "Felstead A.", "AuthorID": "6701751604", "AffiliationID": "60170433, 60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "35467454700": {"Name": "Green F.", "AuthorID": "35467454700", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, LLAKES"}}}
