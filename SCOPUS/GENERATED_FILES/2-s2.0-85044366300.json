In these types, opening/closing the windows, often regarded as window-opening behavior, is more commonly observed because of its convenience. It not only improves indoor air quality to satisfy occupants\u2019 requirement for indoor thermal comfort but also influences building energy consumption. To learn more about potential factors having effects on occupants\u2019 window-opening behavior, a field study was carried out in an office building within a university in Beijing. Window state (open/closed) for a total of 5 windows in 5 offices on the second floor in 285 days (9.5 months) were recorded daily. Potential factors, categorized as environmental and non-environmental ones, were subsequently identified with their impact on window-opening behavior through logistic regression and Pearson correlation approaches. The analytical results show that occupants\u2019 window-opening behavior is more strongly correlated to environmental factors, such as indoor and outdoor air temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity, outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, solar radiation, sunshine hours, in which air temperatures dominate the influence. While the non-environmental factors, i.e. seasonal change, time of day and personal preference, also affects the patterns of window-opening probability. This paper provides solid field data on occupant window opening behavior in China, with high resolutions and demonstrates the way in analyzing and predicting the probability of window-opening behavior. Its discussion into the potential impact factors shall be useful for further investigation of the relationship between building energy consumption and window-opening behavior.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Influential factors", "Office building", "Window state", "Window-opening behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Building energy consumption", "Environmental factors", "Indoor and outdoor airs", "Indoor thermal comfort", "Indoor thermal environments", "Influential factors", "Logistic regressions", "Window openings"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044366300", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"]], "AuthorData": {"55839694200": {"Name": "Pan S.", "AuthorID": "55839694200", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Built Environment and Energy Efficient Technology, Beijing University of Technology"}, "57192720772": {"Name": "Xiong Y.", "AuthorID": "57192720772", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Built Environment and Energy Efficient Technology, Beijing University of Technology"}, "57201333608": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "57201333608", "AffiliationID": "60022281", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Laboratory of Green Built Environment and Energy Efficient Technology, Beijing University of Technology"}, "57209625490": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57209625490", "AffiliationID": "60014437", "AffiliationName": "School of Industrial Technology and Business Studies, Dalarna University"}, "55345227200": {"Name": "Han M.", "AuthorID": "55345227200", "AffiliationID": "60014437", "AffiliationName": "School of Industrial Technology and Business Studies, Dalarna University"}, "23968470200": {"Name": "Xia L.", "AuthorID": "23968470200", "AffiliationID": "60104720", "AffiliationName": "Research Centre for Fluids and Thermal Engineering, University of Nottingham Ningbo China"}, "55504215000": {"Name": "Wei S.", "AuthorID": "55504215000", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London (UCL)"}, "55927434900": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "55927434900", "AffiliationID": "60060517", "AffiliationName": "College of Architecture and Civil Engineering, North China Institute of Science &Technology"}}}
