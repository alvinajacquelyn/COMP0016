Journal of Neurochemistry published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of International Society for Neurochemistry \u03b1-Synuclein is the major component of Lewy bodies and a candidate biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases in which Lewy bodies are common, including Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. A large body of literature suggests that these disorders are characterized by reduced concentrations of \u03b1-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with overlapping concentrations compared to healthy controls and variability across studies. Several reasons can account for this variability, including technical ones, such as inter-assay and inter-laboratory variation (reproducibility). We compared four immunochemical methods for the quantification of \u03b1-synuclein concentration in 50 unique CSF samples. All methods were designed to capture most of the existing \u03b1-synuclein forms in CSF (\u2018total\u2019 \u03b1-synuclein). Each of the four methods showed high analytical precision, excellent correlation between laboratories (R 2 0.83\u20130.99), and good correlation with each other (R 2 0.64\u20130.93), although the slopes of the regression lines were different between the four immunoassays. The use of common reference CSF samples decreased the differences in \u03b1-synuclein concentration between detection methods and technologies. Pilot data on an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) method is also presented. Our results suggest that the four immunochemical methods and the IP-MS method measure similar forms of \u03b1-synuclein and that a common reference material would allow harmonization of results between immunoassays.
