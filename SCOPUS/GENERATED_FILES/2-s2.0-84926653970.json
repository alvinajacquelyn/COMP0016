These new basis sets have significant potential to (1) give some speed-up (estimated at up to 20% for large molecules in fully optimised code) to general-purpose Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory quantum chemistry calculations, replacing all-Gaussian basis sets, and (2) give very large speed-ups for calculations of core-dependent properties, such as electron density at the nucleus, NMR parameters, relativistic corrections, and total energies, replacing the current use of Slater basis functions or very large specialised all-Gaussian basis sets for these purposes. This initial implementation already demonstrates roughly 10% speed-ups in HF/R-31G calculations compared to HF/6-31G calculations for large linear molecules, demonstrating the promise of this methodology, particularly for the second application. As well as the reduction in the total primitive number in R-31G compared to 6-31G, this timing advantage can be attributed to the significant reduction in the number of mathematically complex intermediate integrals after modelling each ramp-Gaussian basis-function-pair as a sum of ramps on a single atomic centre.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Basis functions", "Gaussian basis functions", "Gaussian basis sets", "Hartree-fock", "Linear molecules", "Quantum chemistry calculations", "Relativistic correction", "Two-electron integrals", "Algorithms", "Electrons", "Models, Chemical", "Models, Molecular", "Quantum Theory", "Software", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926653970", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"26423856700": {"Name": "McKemmish L.K.", "AuthorID": "26423856700", "AffiliationID": "60008950", "AffiliationName": "Research School of Chemistry, Australian National University"}}}
