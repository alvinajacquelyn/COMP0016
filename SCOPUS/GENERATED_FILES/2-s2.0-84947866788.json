Methods We used AD patient data (N = 7815) from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center database and multinomial logistic regression to investigate presentation age and first cognitive/behavioral symptoms. Results The odds of having a nonmemory first cognitive symptom (including impairment in judgment and problem solving, language, and visuospatial function) increased with younger age (P <.001, all tests). Compared with apathy/withdrawal, the odds of having depression and \"other\" behavioral symptoms increased with younger age (P <.02, both tests), whereas the odds of having psychosis and no behavioral symptom increased with older age (P <.001, both tests). Discussion There is considerable heterogeneity in the first cognitive/behavioral symptoms experienced by AD patients. Proportions of these symptoms change with age with patients experiencing increasing nonmemory cognitive symptoms and more behavioral symptoms at younger ages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age", "Alzheimer's disease", "Behavior", "Clinical neurology history", "Cognition", "First symptoms", "Neuropsychology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Behavior", "Cognition", "Databases, Factual", "Datasets as Topic", "Female", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "United States"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947866788", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"35556415800": {"Name": "Barnes J.", "AuthorID": "35556415800", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, Dementia Research Centre, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003918293": {"Name": "Dickerson B.C.", "AuthorID": "7003918293", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital"}, "7101816884": {"Name": "Frost C.", "AuthorID": "7101816884", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "55653866900": {"Name": "Jiskoot L.C.", "AuthorID": "55653866900", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Erasmus Medical Center"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center"}, "7004383975": {"Name": "Wolk D.", "AuthorID": "7004383975", "AffiliationID": "60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Penn Memory Center, University of Pennsylvania"}}}
