All-optical ultrasound is an emerging paradigm that exhibits high frequencies, large bandwidths, and a strong miniaturisation potential. Here, we report the design, modelling, and fabrication of a highly directional fibre-optic ultrasound transmitter that uses a composite of reduced graphene oxide and polydimethylsiloxane as the optical ultrasound generator. The ultrasound transmitter, which had an outer diameter of just 630 \u03bcm, generated ultrasound with a pressure exceeding 0.4 MPa for axial distances up to 16 mm, at a large bandwidth of 24.3 MHz. The ultrasound beam exhibited low divergence, with a beam diameter ranging between 0.6 and 2.1 mm for distances between 0 and 16 mm. The presented directional optical ultrasound source is hence well-suited to high-resolution interventional imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["High frequency HF", "High-quality imaging", "Interventional imaging", "Minimally invasive", "Reduced graphene oxides", "Ultrasound beams", "Ultrasound generator", "Ultrasound sources"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063339800", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"56150220800": {"Name": "Colchester R.", "AuthorID": "56150220800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, Charles Bell House, University College London"}, "57200169959": {"Name": "Alles E.", "AuthorID": "57200169959", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, Charles Bell House, University College London"}, "57204519454": {"Name": "Desjardins A.", "AuthorID": "57204519454", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences, Charles Bell House, University College London"}}}
