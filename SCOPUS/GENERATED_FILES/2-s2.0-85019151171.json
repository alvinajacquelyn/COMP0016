Each representation has unique advantages depending on the system of interest and the application goals. In this paper, we provide a joint framework for all three representations in the context of frequency-domain stochastic modeling. This framework allows us to extend many established statistical procedures for bivariate vector time series to complex-valued and rotary representations. These include procedures for parametrically modeling signal coherence, estimating model parameters using the Whittle likelihood, performing semiparametric modeling, and choosing between classes of nested models using model choice. We also provide a new method of testing for impropriety in complex-valued signals, which tests for noncircular or anisotropic second-order statistical structure when the signal is represented in the complex plane. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our methodology in capturing the anisotropic structure of signals observed from fluid dynamic simulations of turbulence.", "AuthorKeywords": ["maximum likelihood estimation", "parameter estimation", "parametric statistics", "spectral analysis", "stochastic processes", "Time series analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analytic signals", "Anisotropic structure", "Complex-valued signal", "Frequency domains", "Model parameters", "Rotary components", "Semi-parametric modeling", "Statistical structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019151171", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"36447846900": {"Name": "Sykulski A.", "AuthorID": "36447846900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6507545514": {"Name": "Olhede S.", "AuthorID": "6507545514", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "8790086900": {"Name": "Lilly J.", "AuthorID": "8790086900", "AffiliationID": "116339954", "AffiliationName": "NorthWest Research Asso."}, "57189059791": {"Name": "Early J.", "AuthorID": "57189059791", "AffiliationID": "116339954", "AffiliationName": "NorthWest Research Asso."}}}
