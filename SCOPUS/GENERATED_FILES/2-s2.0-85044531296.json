In this paper, BPI-S population norms are reported from a total administrative population of adults with intellectual disability (ID). To facilitate the use of the BPI-S in clinical services to assess behavior change, the purpose of this paper is to describe how to use BPI-S clinically significant and reliable change (RC) scores. Design/methodology/approach: Data were gathered on 265 adults with ID known to services. Proxy informants completed the BPI-S on challenging behaviors over the previous six months. Clinically significant cut-off values and RC scores were calculated using the Jacobson and Truax\u2019s (1991) method. Findings: BPI-S clinical reference data are presented to provide benchmarks for individual and group comparisons regarding challenging behavior. Examples demonstrate how to use clinical norms to determine change. Practical implications: Behavior change is a major goal of researchers and practitioners. Data from the present study can make the BPI-S a valuable tool for determining change in challenging behavior following service input or intervention. Originality/value: Whilst well used in research, the BPI-S may be less extensively used in practice. This present study provides data to enable researchers and practitioners to use the BPI-S more widely in assessing clinical outcomes, such as intervention research and service evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assessment", "Behaviour Problems Inventory", "Challenging behaviour", "Intellectual disability", "Normative data", "Reliable change"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044531296", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57192375528": {"Name": "Bowring D.", "AuthorID": "57192375528", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Bangor University"}, "24823598400": {"Name": "Toogood S.", "AuthorID": "24823598400", "AffiliationID": "60025779", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Bangor University"}, "12760208200": {"Name": "Totsika V.", "AuthorID": "12760208200", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research, University of Warwick"}, "7102719472": {"Name": "Hastings R.", "AuthorID": "7102719472", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research, University of Warwick"}}}
