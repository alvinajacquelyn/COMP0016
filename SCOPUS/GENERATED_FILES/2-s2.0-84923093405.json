Despite the fact that tyrosine kinase inhibitors have established targeted molecular therapy in CML, patients often face the risk of developing drug resistance, caused by mutations and/or activation of alternative cellular pathways. To optimize drug development, one needs to systematically test all possible combinations of drug targets within the genetic network that regulates the disease. The BioModelAnalyzer (BMA) is a user-friendly computational tool that allows us to do exactly that. We used BMA to build a CML network-model composed of 54 nodes linked by 104 interactions that encapsulates experimental data collected from 160 publications. While previous studies were limited by their focus on a single pathway or cellular process, our executable model allowed us to probe dynamic interactions between multiple pathways and cellular outcomes, suggest new combinatorial therapeutic targets, and highlight previously unexplored sensitivities to Interleukin-3.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Apoptosis", "bcl-X Protein", "Computational Biology", "Computer Simulation", "Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl", "Gene Knockout Techniques", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Humans", "Imatinib Mesylate", "Interleukin-3", "Interleukin-6", "Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive", "Models, Biological", "ras Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923093405", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56521147100": {"Name": "Chuang R.", "AuthorID": "56521147100", "AffiliationID": "60119937, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge"}, "9739378300": {"Name": "Hall B.A.", "AuthorID": "9739378300", "AffiliationID": "60120019, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "55317777800": {"Name": "Benque D.", "AuthorID": "55317777800", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "13008902100": {"Name": "Cook B.", "AuthorID": "13008902100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6603451493": {"Name": "Ishtiaq S.", "AuthorID": "6603451493", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "35581562900": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "35581562900", "AffiliationID": "60098463", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "7404017563": {"Name": "Fisher J.", "AuthorID": "7404017563", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "6602375869": {"Name": "Piterman N.", "AuthorID": "6602375869", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Leicester"}, "7005334525": {"Name": "Vardi M.", "AuthorID": "7005334525", "AffiliationID": "60005286", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Rice University"}, "6602834131": {"Name": "Koschmieder S.", "AuthorID": "6602834131", "AffiliationID": "60001097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University Hospital of Aachen"}, "6701818487": {"Name": "Gottgens B.", "AuthorID": "6701818487", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60105833", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust, MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute"}}}
