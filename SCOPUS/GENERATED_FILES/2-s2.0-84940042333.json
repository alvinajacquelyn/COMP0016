The main aim of this paper was to explore if such variation in testing and reporting is still present, to compare the management of CDI cases, and to investigate if there is any significant variation in the antibiotic policies among different hospitals. Using London hospitals as a sample, results show that there is still a wide variation of testing methods and reporting used, making comparisons difficult. It is likely that the overall variability in practices would be greater at a national and, even more, at international level. The relationship between broad-spectrum antibiotics and C. difficile incidence and alternative approaches in antibiotic guidelines may require further studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibiotic policies", "Clostridium difficile", "diagnosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940042333", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Advanced and Specialized Nursing", "NURS", "2902"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"25626807100": {"Name": "Satta G.", "AuthorID": "25626807100", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital, Department of Pathology (Microbiology)"}, "56594557600": {"Name": "Parekh S.", "AuthorID": "56594557600", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital, Department of Pathology (Microbiology)"}, "57214758762": {"Name": "Dabrowski H.", "AuthorID": "57214758762", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital, Department of Pathology (Microbiology)"}, "25226817300": {"Name": "Petkar H.", "AuthorID": "25226817300", "AffiliationID": "60031025", "AffiliationName": "North Middlesex University Hospital, Department of Pathology (Microbiology)"}}}
