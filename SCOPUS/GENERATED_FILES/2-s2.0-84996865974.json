Samples have been studied from two different tectonic settings: (1) the northern Massif Central, France, an uplifted and rifted plateau on continental lithosphere and (2) Lanzarote in the Canary Islands, an intraplate volcanic island on old oceanic lithosphere. \u03bc-CT analysis of samples from both locations has revealed a range of spinel textures from small < 2 mm microcrystals which can be either spatially concentrated or distributed more evenly throughout the rock with a lineation, to large 4\u201312 mm individual clusters with ellipsoidal complex vermicular textures in random orientation. Microprobe analyses of pyroxenes inside and outside the clusters show broadly similar compositions. Spinel\u2013pyroxene clusters are the result of a transition of shallow lithospheric mantle from the garnet stability field to the spinel stability field. Both the northern Massif Central and Lanzarote are regions that have experienced significant lithospheric thinning. This process provides a mechanism where the sub-solidus reaction of olivine + garnet = orthopyroxene + clinopyroxene + spinel is satisfied by providing a pathway from garnet peridotite to spinel peridotite. We predict that such textures would only occur in the mantle beneath regions that show evidence of thinning of the lithospheric mantle. Metasomatic reactions are seen around spinel\u2013pyroxene clusters in some Lanzarote xenoliths, so metasomatism post-dated cluster formation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CT-scanning", "Metasomatism", "Peridotites", "Spinel\u2013pyroxene clusters"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996865974", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"57192082566": {"Name": "Bhanot K.", "AuthorID": "57192082566", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "57207506826": {"Name": "Downes H.", "AuthorID": "57207506826", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "6603556339": {"Name": "Petrone C.", "AuthorID": "6603556339", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "56462961000": {"Name": "Humphreys-Williams E.", "AuthorID": "56462961000", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}}}
