A multidisciplinary approach to the care of these patients is essential in order to reduce postoperative complications and preserve function in the transplanted organ. By their nature, patients undergoing liver transplantation have complicated medical problems before surgery which must be borne in mind when managing them after surgery. Haemorrhage, haemodynamic instability, acute renal failure, hepatic artery thrombosis and primary graft non-function are some of the complications that clinicians must be prepared for in the first days after transplantation. Pre-empting complications and acting rapidly to overt them is likely to have a considerable positive impact in these patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Critical Care", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units", "Liver Transplantation", "Postoperative Care"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019121985", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57194179789": {"Name": "Bates E.", "AuthorID": "57194179789", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Perioperative Research Group, Royal Free NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24594583700": {"Name": "Martin D.", "AuthorID": "24594583700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
