Within the multidisciplinary team, physical therapy plays a central role in management of individuals with hypermobility related disorders. However, many physical therapists are not familiar with the diagnostic criteria, prevalence, common clinical presentation, and management. This guideline aims to provide practitioners with the state of the art regarding the assessment and management of children, adolescents, and adults with JHS/hEDS. Due to the complexity of the symptoms in the profile of JHS/hEDS, the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is adopted as a central framework whereby the umbrella term of disability is used to encompass functions, activities and participation, as well as environmental and personal factors. The current evidence-based literature regarding the management of JHS/hEDS is limited in size and quality and there is insufficient research exploring the clinical outcomes of a number of interventions. Multicenter randomized controlled trials are warranted to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions for children and adults. Until further multicenter trials are conducted, clinical decision-making should be based on theoretical and the current limited research evidence. For all individuals diagnosed with JHS/hEDS, international consensus and combined efforts to identify risk profiles would create a better understanding of the pathological mechanisms and the potential for optimizing health care for affected individuals. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diagnostics", "guidelines", "international classification of functioning", "joint hypermobility syndrome/hypermobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome", "physical therapy", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome", "Humans", "Joint Instability", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Practice Guidelines as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015675922", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"7004206097": {"Name": "Engelbert R.", "AuthorID": "7004206097", "AffiliationID": "60103347", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Applied Research, Education of Physiotherapy, Faculty of Health, University of Applied Sciences Amsterdam"}, "55897001300": {"Name": "Juul-Kristensen B.", "AuthorID": "55897001300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "26039481900": {"Name": "Pacey V.", "AuthorID": "26039481900", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "38662479200": {"Name": "de Wandele I.", "AuthorID": "38662479200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6507635783": {"Name": "Smeenk S.", "AuthorID": "6507635783", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57193664319": {"Name": "Woinarosky N.", "AuthorID": "57193664319", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57193666723": {"Name": "Sabo S.", "AuthorID": "57193666723", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55215130300": {"Name": "Scheper M.", "AuthorID": "55215130300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7004178870": {"Name": "Russek L.", "AuthorID": "7004178870", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "20434379700": {"Name": "Simmonds J.", "AuthorID": "20434379700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
