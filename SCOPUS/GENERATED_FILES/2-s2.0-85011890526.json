All rights reserved.A large proportion of the southern UK is underlain by stiff clays. Improving their geotechnical characterisation is important for many current and future infrastructure projects. This paper presents an integrated study of the complex stiffness behaviour of four key medium-plasticity, highly overconsolidated strata: the Gault, Kimmeridge, Oxford and London clays. The latter were deposited between the Jurassic and the Eocene under broadly similar marine conditions. Coordinated programmes of advanced static and dynamic laboratory measurements have been undertaken on high-quality samples, concentrating on samples taken from similar depths at inland sites and including triaxial and hollow cylinder stress path experiments employing high-resolution local strain, multi-axial bender element and resonant column techniques. A new approach was employed to interpret the hollow cylinder experiments and the laboratory measurements are examined in combination with independent field shear wave data. The clays\u2019 stiffness characteristics are shown to be markedly anisotropic, pressure dependent and highly non-linear. Synthesis allows key conclusions to be drawn regarding: the relative reliability of alternative measurement approaches; the potential spread of stiffness behaviours between the clays; and whether the clays\u2019 varying geological ages and burial depths have any systematic influence on their stiffness characteristics. The results have important geotechnical engineering implications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anisotropy", "Clays", "Fabric/structure of soils", "Laboratory tests", "Stiffness", "Stress path"], "IndexKeywords": ["Complex stiffness", "Fabric/structure of soils", "Infrastructure project", "Laboratory measurements", "Laboratory test", "Pressure dependent", "Stiffness characteristics", "Stress paths"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011890526", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"]], "AuthorData": {"56674331000": {"Name": "Brosse A.", "AuthorID": "56674331000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "56673813900": {"Name": "Kamal R.", "AuthorID": "56673813900", "AffiliationID": "60072185", "AffiliationName": "DNV.GL"}, "7006687027": {"Name": "Jardine R.", "AuthorID": "7006687027", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "12243933700": {"Name": "Coop M.", "AuthorID": "12243933700", "AffiliationID": "60013983", "AffiliationName": "City University of Hong Kong"}}}
