All rights reserved.Background: To examine the combined influence of changes in physical activity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption on all-cause mortality. Methods: Health behaviours were assessed in 1984/1985 and 1991/1992 in 8123 adults from the UK (4666 women, median age 41.0 years). An unhealthy lifestyle score was calculated, allocating one point for smoking, fruits and vegetables <3 times a day, physical activity <2 hours a week and >14 units (women) or >21 units of alcohol (men) per week. Results: There were 2003 deaths over a median follow-up of 6.6 years (IQR 5.9-7.2) following the resurvey. The modal change in the unhealthy lifestyle score was zero, 41.8% had the same score, 35.5% decreased and 22.7% increased score between surveys. A one unit decrease in the unhealthy lifestyle score was not associated with a beneficial effect on mortality (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.04). A one unit increase in the unhealthy lifestyle score increased the risk of mortality (adjusted HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18). Conclusions: In this general population sample, the adoption of an unhealthy lifestyle was associated with an increased risk of mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["epidemiology", "lifestyle", "mortality"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cause of Death", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049230855", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57192010086": {"Name": "White J.", "AuthorID": "57192010086", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Public Health Improvement, College of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "35388023700": {"Name": "Greene G.", "AuthorID": "35388023700", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Division of Population Medicine, School of Medicine, Neuadd Meirionnydd, Cardiff University"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivimaki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
