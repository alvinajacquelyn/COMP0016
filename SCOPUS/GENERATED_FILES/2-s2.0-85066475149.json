The guideline writing committee included medical representatives from hepatology and gastroenterology groups as well as patient representatives from PSC Support. The guidelines aim to support general physicians, gastroenterologists and surgeons in managing adults with PSC or those presenting with similar cholangiopathies which may mimic PSC, such as IgG4 sclerosing cholangitis. It also acts as a reference for patients with PSC to help them understand their own management. Quality of evidence is presented using the AGREE II format. Guidance is meant to be used as a reference rather than for rigid protocol-based care as we understand that management of patients often requires individual patient-centred considerations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["sclerosing cholangitis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biliary Tract Neoplasms", "Cholangitis, Sclerosing", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Diagnostic Techniques, Digestive System", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G4-Related Disease", "Patient Care Management", "Prognosis", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066475149", "SubjectAreas": [["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"35309651800": {"Name": "Chapman M.H.", "AuthorID": "35309651800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56020145200": {"Name": "Webster G.G.J.", "AuthorID": "56020145200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "GI Division, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57205414322": {"Name": "Pereira S.P.", "AuthorID": "57205414322", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}, "55217322300": {"Name": "Thorburn D.", "AuthorID": "55217322300", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "15732485400": {"Name": "Alexander G.", "AuthorID": "15732485400", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Liver Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57196427048": {"Name": "Hirschfield G.M.", "AuthorID": "57196427048", "AffiliationID": "60016849, 60014468", "AffiliationName": "Toronto Centre for Liver Disease, University Health Network and University of Toronto"}, "57204797288": {"Name": "Rushbrook S.M.", "AuthorID": "57204797288", "AffiliationID": "60017129", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55747278500": {"Name": "Collier J.", "AuthorID": "55747278500", "AffiliationID": "60008323", "AffiliationName": "Hepatology, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "55868911000": {"Name": "Dyson J.K.", "AuthorID": "55868911000", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "26642898700": {"Name": "Jones D.E.J.", "AuthorID": "26642898700", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University"}, "37034828200": {"Name": "Patanwala I.", "AuthorID": "37034828200", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "University of Liverpool"}, "56518240600": {"Name": "Thain C.", "AuthorID": "56518240600", "AffiliationID": "114993755", "AffiliationName": "PBC Foundation"}, "56517830900": {"Name": "Walmsley M.", "AuthorID": "56517830900", "AffiliationID": "114993747", "AffiliationName": "Trustees PSC Support"}}}
