By addressing the impact of massive MIMO on the user association, we compare and analyze user association schemes: 1) downlink received signal power (DRSP)-based approach for maximizing the harvested energy and 2) uplink received signal power (URSP)-based approach for minimizing the uplink path loss. We adopt the linear maximal-ratio transmission beamforming for massive MIMO power transfer to recharge users. By deriving new statistical properties, we obtain the exact and asymptotic expressions for the average harvested energy. Then, we derive the average uplink achievable rate under the harvested energy constraint. Numerical results demonstrate that the use of massive MIMO antennas can improve both the users' harvested energy and uplink achievable rate in the HetNets; however, it has negligible effect on the ambient RF energy harvesting. Serving more users in the massive MIMO macrocells will deteriorate the uplink information transfer because of less harvested energy and more uplink interference. Moreover, although DRSP-based user association harvests more energy to provide larger uplink transmit power than the URSP-based one in the massive MIMO HetNets, URSP-based user association could achieve better performance in the uplink information transmission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy harvesting", "heterogeneous network (HetNet)", "massive MIMO", "user association", "wireless power transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotic expressions", "Heterogeneous Network (HetNet)", "Heterogeneous network (HetNets)", "Information transmission", "Maximal ratio transmissions", "User associations", "Wireless power transfer", "Wireless power transfer (WPT)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992410688", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56021641700": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "56021641700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56072896600": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "56072896600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "57189902299": {"Name": "Zheng Z.", "AuthorID": "57189902299", "AffiliationID": "117991180", "AffiliationName": "China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, East China Institute of Telecommunications"}}}
