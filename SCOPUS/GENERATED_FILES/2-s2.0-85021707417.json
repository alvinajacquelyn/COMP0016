Two ECG-derived markers are presented to quantify T-wave morphological variability in the temporal, dw, and amplitude, da , domains. Two additional markers, dwNL and daNL , that only capture the non-linear component of dw and da are also proposed. The proposed markers are used to quantify T-wave time and amplitude variations in 500 24-hour ECG recordings from chronic heart failure patients. Additionally, two mean warped T-waves, used in the calculation of those markers, are proposed to compensate for the rate dependence of the T-wave morphology. Statistical analysis is used to evaluate the correlation between dw, dwNL , da and daNL and the maximum intra-subject RR range, \u2206RR. Results show that the mean warped T-wave is able to compensate for the morphological differences due to RR dynamics. Moreover, the metrics dw and dwNL are correlated with \u2206RR, but da and daNL are not. The proposed dw and dwNL quantify variations in the temporal domain of the T-wave that are correlated with the RR range and, thus, could possibly reflect the variations of dispersion of repolarization due to changes in heart rate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electrocardiogram", "Morphological variability", "Repolarization", "T-wave", "Time-warping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amplitude variations", "Chronic heart failures", "Morphological variability", "Repolarization", "T waves", "T-wave morphologies", "Time warping", "Time warping methods"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021707417", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"55637370300": {"Name": "Ram\u00edrez J.", "AuthorID": "55637370300", "AffiliationID": "60120576", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center (CIBER)"}, "7004512193": {"Name": "Pueyo E.", "AuthorID": "7004512193", "AffiliationID": "60120576", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center (CIBER)"}, "56216881700": {"Name": "Laguna P.", "AuthorID": "56216881700", "AffiliationID": "60120576", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Research Networking Center (CIBER)"}, "26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
