However, peripheral measurements of cytokines do not readily translate to immunological activity in the brain. The aim of the present study was to study brain immune and inflammatory activity. To this end, we analyzed cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid from 121 euthymic bipolar disorder patients and 71 age and sex matched control subjects. Concentrations of 11 different cytokines were determined using immunoassays. Cerebrospinal fluid IL-8 concentrations were significantly higher in patients as compared to controls. The other cytokines measured were only detectable in part of the sample. IL-8 concentrations were positively associated to lithium- and antipsychotic treatment. The findings might reflect immune aberrations in bipolar disorder, or be due to the effects of medication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antipsychotic drugs", "Biomarkers", "Bipolar disorder", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Cytokines", "Interleukin-8", "Lithium"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antimanic Agents", "Antipsychotic Agents", "Bipolar Disorder", "Female", "Humans", "Interleukin-8", "Lithium", "Male", "Middle Aged"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84919362798", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"53877274400": {"Name": "Isgren A.", "AuthorID": "53877274400", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg and M\u00f6lndal"}, "55508135900": {"Name": "Jakobsson J.", "AuthorID": "55508135900", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg and M\u00f6lndal"}, "6603374219": {"Name": "P\u00e5lsson E.", "AuthorID": "6603374219", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg and M\u00f6lndal"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg and M\u00f6lndal"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004259279": {"Name": "Land\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "7004259279", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}, "56116170200": {"Name": "Ekman C.", "AuthorID": "56116170200", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "36871009900": {"Name": "Johansson A.", "AuthorID": "36871009900", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet"}, "37020689800": {"Name": "Sellgren C.", "AuthorID": "37020689800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
