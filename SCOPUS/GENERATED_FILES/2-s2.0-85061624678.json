This urge results from the often-unbearable suffering and the disruption of everyday life, routines, and relations. Moreover, dreams and aspirations one had for the future, the realization of which they perceived as important in leading a meaningful life, may be lost or have to be reconsidered. Accompanying feelings of disappointment, demoralization, or even desperation are often treated as symptoms of depression. This approach is called into question by the concept of demoralization, which points to the presence of healthy modes of functioning in a state of lucid awareness of one\u2019s condition. In this article, we focus on the case of schizophrenia, as we suppose that having to deal with recurring psychotic episodes constitutes such a pervasive experience, possibly leading to meaning deficiency. We propose then a treatment perspective that integrates care for the processes of mourning and of meaning making. This view, described here in the case of schizophrenic psychosis, is offered as a paradigm that can serve the approach to other serious conditions requiring prolonged care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["demoralization", "depression", "existential", "humanistic", "meaning", "psychosis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061624678", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"15043925600": {"Name": "Eneman M.", "AuthorID": "15043925600", "AffiliationID": "122174565", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Center St.-Kamillus"}, "26022725300": {"Name": "Vanhee L.", "AuthorID": "26022725300", "AffiliationID": "122174565", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Center St.-Kamillus"}, "57195320108": {"Name": "Liessens D.", "AuthorID": "57195320108", "AffiliationID": "122174565", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Center St.-Kamillus"}, "7004725957": {"Name": "Luyten P.", "AuthorID": "7004725957", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "University of Leuven"}, "6507906732": {"Name": "Corveleyn J.", "AuthorID": "6507906732", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "University of Leuven"}, "7003400751": {"Name": "Sabbe B.", "AuthorID": "7003400751", "AffiliationID": "114338333", "AffiliationName": "University Psychiatric Center Duffel-UZA"}}}
