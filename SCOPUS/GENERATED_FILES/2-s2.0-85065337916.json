School-based physical activity (PA) interventions have shown mixed effects on girl's activity levels, with multi-component approaches involving both school and community links appearing more effective for sustainable change. The purpose of the current research was to gather views from preadolescent girls, parents, teachers and stakeholders in order to co-produce a multi-component school-based, community linked PA intervention programme. Methods: Focus groups were conducted in two primary schools with 34 girls aged 9-11 years and 11 parents (10 female, 1 male). In-depth interviews were conducted with four female teachers (including two head teachers). Focus groups and interviews focused on programme design (structure, content and delivery) and potential factors affecting intervention uptake and continued PA participation. A series of stakeholder engagement events occurred throughout the study period. All data were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed in NVivo 11. Results: Girls reported that fun taster sessions delivered by role models would encourage them to participate in a school-based role model programme, with tailored taster sessions each week to enhance continued PA participation. Parents and teachers identified a number of barriers to uptake and continued PA participation, and active involvement of stakeholders facilitated the development of intervention strategies. Strategies included; single-sex after-school sessions, use of female role models, low-cost activity options and mapping community provision. Analyses revealed the importance of tailoring the programme to align with local needs, demands and provision. Conclusions: Data show numerous barriers to intervention uptake and continued PA participation when designing a school-based, community-linked intervention. Adopting a co-production approach, this formative work highlights a number of potential strategies for overcoming these barriers. Findings from the research directed the development and implementation of the CHARMING role model intervention and informed the creation of an intervention logic model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Community", "Design", "Intervention", "Multi-component", "Physical activity", "Preadolescent", "Primary school", "Role modelling", "School"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Exercise", "Female", "Focus Groups", "Health Promotion", "Humans", "Male", "Parents", "Program Development", "School Health Services"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065337916", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"15734189900": {"Name": "Morgan K.", "AuthorID": "15734189900", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "DECIPHer, School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "57201617529": {"Name": "Van Godwin J.", "AuthorID": "57201617529", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "DECIPHer, School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University"}, "54398076600": {"Name": "Darwent K.", "AuthorID": "54398076600", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "Nursing, Midwifery and Allied Health Professions Research Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences and Sport, Stirling University"}, "54414058400": {"Name": "Fildes A.", "AuthorID": "54414058400", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60163612", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine and Health, School of Psychology, Niversity of Leeds"}}}
