Materials and methods Fifty-two patients were categorised into \u201cischaemic\u201d and \u201cnon-ischaemic\u201d types based on clinical and blood-gas findings: 10 patients with non-ischaemic priapism; 20 with ischaemic priapism before surgical shunt placement and 22 with ischaemic priapism after surgical shunt placement. DUS traces were analysed: peak systolic velocity (PSV) and mean velocity (MV) were calculated. Histological samples were obtained at the time of surgery. Three clinical outcome groups were defined: (1) normal, (2) regular use of pharmacostimulation, and (3) refractory dysfunction/penile implant. Results All non-ischaemic priapism cases had a PSV >50 cm/s and all but one had an MV of >6.5 cm/s. In pre-surgery ischaemic cases, all men had a PSV <50 cm/s and MV <6.5 cm/s. Two flow patterns were observed in this group: PSV <25 cm/s in all men scanned before needle aspiration; and in 6/14 after needle aspiration, a high velocity/high resistance (low net inflow) pattern, with peak systolic flows >22 cm/s but diastolic reversal. In post-surgery ischaemic priapism, flow parameters overlapped with the non-ischaemic group. PSV/MV did not predict clinical outcome or histology. Conclusion In the present cohort, PSV <50 cm/s and MV <6.5 cm/s were predictive of ischaemic priapism (pre-shunt; p<0.01). Patients with ischaemic priapism may show PSV >22 cm/s, but have diastolic reversal and therefore low net perfusion. Post-shunt, DUS findings were extremely variable and did not predict histology or clinical outcome.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Blood Flow Velocity", "Humans", "Ischemia", "Male", "Penis", "Priapism", "Retrospective Studies", "Systole", "Ultrasonography, Doppler"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016009053", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55682302100": {"Name": "von Stempel C.", "AuthorID": "55682302100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London"}, "7402266611": {"Name": "Allen C.", "AuthorID": "7402266611", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London"}, "8833101600": {"Name": "Ramachandran N.", "AuthorID": "8833101600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London"}, "25422679800": {"Name": "Walkden M.", "AuthorID": "25422679800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London"}, "15053220400": {"Name": "Kirkham A.", "AuthorID": "15053220400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London"}, "24765500600": {"Name": "Zacharakis E.", "AuthorID": "24765500600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, University College London"}, "7003826887": {"Name": "Minhas S.", "AuthorID": "7003826887", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, University College London"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, University College London"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Andrology, University College London"}, "8972541300": {"Name": "Freeman A.", "AuthorID": "8972541300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London"}}}
