We present the origins of this method in terms of spectroscopic analysis of tissue using near-infrared light and its extension to an imaging modality.Models for light propagation at the macroscopic and mesoscopic scale are developed from the radiative transfer equation (RTE). Both time- and frequency-domain systems are discussed. Some formal results based on Green\u2019s function models are presented, and numerical methods are described based on discrete finite element method (FEM) models and a Bayesian framework for image reconstruction. Finally, some open questions are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944532362", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7005049501": {"Name": "Kaipio J.", "AuthorID": "7005049501", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Auckland"}, "6601968005": {"Name": "Kolehmainen V.", "AuthorID": "6601968005", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Mathematics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "8283868000": {"Name": "Tarvainen T.", "AuthorID": "8283868000", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Mathematics, University of Eastern Finland"}}}
