However, we believe the conceptual foundation of cognitive scripts imported from Abelson and colleagues was rather unclear and is too narrow to support current script research. We therefore review the notion of scripts to both promote clarity and better connect it to mainstream situational prevention and criminology more generally. We also seek to broaden the approach by exploring additional cross-disciplinary links. We believe all this will support the progressively more demanding uses to which the procedural analysis of crime may be put in research and practice and\u2014more broadly\u2014challenge how human behaviour in crime is analysed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptability", "Crime science", "Crime scripts", "Situational crime prevention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939248210", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"23027536600": {"Name": "Ekblom P.", "AuthorID": "23027536600", "AffiliationID": "60032343", "AffiliationName": "University of Huddersfield"}, "36008402100": {"Name": "Gill M.", "AuthorID": "36008402100", "AffiliationID": "114059299", "AffiliationName": "Perpetuity Research"}}}
