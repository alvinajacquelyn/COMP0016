Due to the high contrast as well as the small angular distance between the circumstellar dust and the star, direct observation of this dust component is challenging. An alternative way to explore the hot exozodiacal dust is provided by mid-infrared interferometry. We analyse the L, M and N bands interferometric signature of this emission in order to find stronger constraints for the properties and the origin of the hot exozodiacal dust. Considering the parameters of nine debris disc systems derived previously, we model the discs in each of these bands. We find that the M band possesses the best conditions to detect hot dust emission, closely followed by L and N bands. The hot dust in three systems - HD 22484 (10 Tau), HD 102647 (\u03b2 Leo) and HD 177724 (\u03b6 Aql) - shows a strong signal in the visibility functions, which may even allow one to constrain the dust location. In particular, observations in the mid-infrared could help to determine whether the dust piles up at the sublimation radius or is located at radii up to 1 au. In addition, we explore observations of the hot exozodiacal dust with the upcoming mid-infrared interferometer Multi AperTure mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment (MATISSE) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Circumstellar matter", "Infrared: planetary systems", "Interplanetary medium", "Techniques: interferometric"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045950346", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55633098300": {"Name": "Kirchschlager F.", "AuthorID": "55633098300", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, Kiel University"}, "57203438570": {"Name": "Wolf S.", "AuthorID": "57203438570", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, Kiel University"}, "35324030400": {"Name": "Brunngr\u00e4ber R.", "AuthorID": "35324030400", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astrophysics, Kiel University"}, "14630745200": {"Name": "Matter A.", "AuthorID": "14630745200", "AffiliationID": "60010513, 60110693, 60008134, 60110744", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Lagrange, Universit\u00e9 C\u00f4te d'Azur, Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d'Azur, CNRS, Boulevard de l'Observatoire"}, "7003545288": {"Name": "Krivov A.", "AuthorID": "7003545288", "AffiliationID": "60029507", "AffiliationName": "Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Astrophysical Institute and University Observatory"}, "57194011904": {"Name": "Labdon A.", "AuthorID": "57194011904", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Exeter"}}}
