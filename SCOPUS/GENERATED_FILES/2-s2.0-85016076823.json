Small conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels are found ubiquitously throughout the brain and have been extensively characterized both molecularly and physiologically in terms of structure and function. It is clear that SK channels are key determinants of neural excitability as they mediate important neuronal response properties such as spike frequency adaptation. However, the functional roles of the different known SK channel subtypes are not well understood. Here we review recent evidence from the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish suggesting that the function of different SK channel subtypes is to optimize the processing of independent but behaviorally relevant stimulus attributes. Indeed, natural sensory stimuli frequently consist of a fast time-varying waveform (i.e., the carrier) whose amplitude (i.e., the envelope) varies slowly and independently. We first review evidence showing how somatic SK2 channels mediate tuning and responses to carrier waveforms. We then review evidence showing how dendritic SK1 channels instead determine tuning and optimize responses to envelope waveforms based on their statistics as found in the organism's natural environment in an independent fashion. The high degree of functional homology between SK channels in electric fish and their mammalian orthologs, as well as the many important parallels between the electrosensory system and the mammalian visual, auditory, and vestibular systems, suggest that these functional roles are conserved across systems and species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["envelope", "information theory", "optimal coding", "SK channels", "weakly electric fish"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Brain", "Electric Fish", "Generalization, Stimulus", "Neurons", "Pyramidal Cells", "Small-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016076823", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"57189597704": {"Name": "Huang C.", "AuthorID": "57189597704", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, McGill University"}, "6701543076": {"Name": "Chacron M.", "AuthorID": "6701543076", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, McGill University"}}}
