Design: Cross sectional reliability study. Setting: University teaching hospital. Methods: Fifty healthy volunteers and 50 voice disorder patients had supervised recordings in a quiet room using OperaVOX by the iPod's internal microphone with sampling rate of 45 kHz. A five-seconds recording of vowel/a/was used to measure fundamental frequency (F0), jitter, shimmer and noise-to-harmonic ratio (NHR). All healthy volunteers and 21 patients had a second recording. The recorded voices were also analysed using the MDVP. The inter- and intrasoftware reliability was analysed using intraclass correlation (ICC) test and Bland-Altman (BA) method. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the acoustic parameters between healthy volunteers and patients. Results: Nine of 50 patients had severe aperiodic voice. The ICC was high with a confidence interval of >0.75 for the inter- and intrasoftware reliability except for the NHR. For the intersoftware BA analysis, excluding the severe aperiodic voice data sets, the bias (95% LOA) of F0, jitter, shimmer and NHR was 0.81 (11.32, -9.71); -0.13 (1.26, -1.52); -0.52 (1.68, -2.72); and 0.08 (0.27, -0.10). For the intrasoftware reliability, it was -1.48 (18.43, -21.39); 0.05 (1.31, -1.21); -0.01 (2.87, -2.89); and 0.005 (0.20, -0.18), respectively. Normative data from the healthy volunteers were obtained. There was a significant difference in all acoustic parameters between volunteers and patients measured by the Opera-VOX (P < 0.001) except for F0 in females (P = 0.87). Conclusion: OperaVOX is comparable to MDVP and has high internal consistency for measuring the F0, jitter and shimmer of voice except for the NHR.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mobile Applications", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sex Factors", "Speech Acoustics", "Voice Disorders", "Voice Quality"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921395875", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"8866831100": {"Name": "Mat Baki M.", "AuthorID": "8866831100", "AffiliationID": "60000968", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "122650332", "AffiliationName": "Davis, Department of Otolaryngology, University of California"}, "20836292100": {"Name": "Wood G.", "AuthorID": "20836292100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital, University College London Hospital NHS Trust"}, "56487400100": {"Name": "Alston M.", "AuthorID": "56487400100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital, University College London Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7102134834": {"Name": "Ratcliffe P.", "AuthorID": "7102134834", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital, University College London Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7402517753": {"Name": "Rubin J.S.", "AuthorID": "7402517753", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Throat Nose Ear Hospital, University College London Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57219561049": {"Name": "Sandhu G.", "AuthorID": "57219561049", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London, Charing Cross Hospital"}}}
