From estimations made using cylinder models, it is known that curvature is expected to increase the buckling strength and the ultimate strength of a curved plate. Therefore, it may be designed accordingly. This study aims to clarify and examine the fundamental behaviour of cylindrically curved plates under axial compression and lateral pressure via a series of elasto-plastic large deflection analyses. On the basis of these results, the effects of curvature, initial deflection, slenderness and aspect ratio, boundary conditions and secondary buckling behaviour are discussed and developed with a modified Faulkner's formula to obtain a double beta formula to predict the ultimate strength of the curved plate.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cylindrically curved plate", "Design formula", "Ships and offshore structures", "Stiffened curved plate", "Ultimate strength"], "IndexKeywords": ["Curved plates", "Design formulae", "Geometric characteristics", "Initial deflection", "Large deflection analysis", "Numerical investigations", "Secondary buckling", "Ultimate strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051796841", "SubjectAreas": [["Civil and Structural Engineering", "ENGI", "2205"], ["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"15080840800": {"Name": "Park J.", "AuthorID": "15080840800", "AffiliationID": "60094133", "AffiliationName": "Central Research Institute, Samsung Heavy Industries Co., Ltd."}, "35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, Pusan National University"}, "36890591400": {"Name": "Seo J.", "AuthorID": "36890591400", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, Pusan National University"}}}
