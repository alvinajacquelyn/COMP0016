This is made possible by the recent completion of the long-term project to calculate the NNLO corrections to the hard cross section. We find that a good description of the ATLAS data is not possible with the default treatment of experimental systematic errors, and propose a simplified solution that retains the dominant physical information of the data. We then investigate the fit quality and the impact on the gluon PDF central value and uncertainty when the ATLAS and CMS data are included in a MMHT fit. We consider both common choices for the factorization and renormalization scale, namely the inclusive jet transverse momentum, p\u22a5, and the leading jet p\u22a5, as well as the different jet radii for which the ATLAS and CMS data are made available. We find that the impact of these data on the gluon is relatively insensitive to these inputs, in particular the scale choice, while the inclusion of NNLO corrections tends to improve the data description somewhat and has a qualitatively similar though not identical impact on the gluon in comparison to NLO.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044301943", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"35589760900": {"Name": "Harland-Lang L.A.", "AuthorID": "35589760900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101652961": {"Name": "Thorne R.S.", "AuthorID": "7101652961", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7404932388": {"Name": "Martin A.D.", "AuthorID": "7404932388", "AffiliationID": "60022175, 60176038", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology, University of Durham"}}}
