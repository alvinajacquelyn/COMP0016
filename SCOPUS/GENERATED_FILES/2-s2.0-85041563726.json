I set out to evaluate such claims by first sketching two competing formulations of autonomy; namely, (a) liberal autonomy concomitant to political power, and (b) autonomy that arises out of the practice of critical self-reflection. I proceed by testing codeswitching within each formulation to reveal how\u2013in this case\u2013these two conceptualisations of autonomy are educationally incompatible with each other. I conclude by suggesting that educational interventions such as codeswitching may ultimately be complicit in the longer term processes of racialisation and marginalisation that they seek to diminish, not only because they carry the potential to damage minority students\u2019 self-integrity, but also because they limit possibilities for both majority and minority students to engage in dialectical encounters that may open avenues to new principles of social and political organisation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomy", "critical theory", "liberal education", "liberalism", "race and racialization", "urban education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041563726", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"]], "AuthorData": {"57200548947": {"Name": "Bicker J.", "AuthorID": "57200548947", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
