Decision-making at the finance-marketing interface is under-researched, particularly for project businesses. Confronted by demands of accountability concerning the allocation of resources to meet competitive pressures, the paper examines the quality and extent of dialogue in investment decision-making. The return on investment (ROI) and marketing-specific investment (ROMI) are important factors at the marketing-finance interface. ROMI/ROI is examined from quantitative and qualitative viewpoints. The empirical evidence shows that short-term financial criteria dominate and are misaligned to long-term performance of project businesses and business units. Marketing investment in relation to project markets poses a particularly challenging environment. Client lifetime value and programme data sets for ROMI coupled with qualitative decision-making offer ways forward with constructive dialogue at the finance-marketing interface. The paper concludes with detailed recommendations for research and practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decision-making", "Dialogue", "Finance", "Marketing", "Performance", "ROMI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Competitive pressure", "Constructive dialogue", "Dialogue", "Investment decision making", "Long term performance", "Marketing-finance interfaces", "Performance", "ROMI"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912150345", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"13410539800": {"Name": "Smyth H.", "AuthorID": "13410539800", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "56067104600": {"Name": "Lecoeuvre L.", "AuthorID": "56067104600", "AffiliationID": "60165274, 60104665, 60107931", "AffiliationName": "Univ Lille Nord de France, LSMRC, Skema Business School"}}}
