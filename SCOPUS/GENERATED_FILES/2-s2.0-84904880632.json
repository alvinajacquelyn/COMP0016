In particular, we treat oscillations as the (observable) signature of context-sensitive changes in synaptic efficacy that underlie coordinated dynamics and message-passing in the brain. This rich source of information is now being exploited by various procedures-like dynamic causal modelling-to test hypotheses about neuronal circuits in health and disease. Furthermore, the roles played by neuromodulatory mechanisms can be addressed directly through their effects on oscillatory phenomena. These neuromodulatory or gain control processes are central to many theories of normal brain function (e.g. attention) and the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g. Parkinson's disease). \u00a9 2014.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Biological Clocks", "Brain", "Humans", "Models, Neurological", "Nonlinear Dynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84904880632", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "22954126400": {"Name": "Pinotsis D.", "AuthorID": "22954126400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "23995713600": {"Name": "Litvak V.", "AuthorID": "23995713600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "54384946500": {"Name": "Bastos A.", "AuthorID": "54384946500", "AffiliationID": "60104969", "AffiliationName": "Ernst Str\u00fcngmann Institute in Cooperation with Max Planck Society"}}}
