This discrete model is validated by comparing the results with experiments and those obtained using a continuum model, for the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane in Pd/\u03b3-alumina catalyst particles. The results show that pore blocking has a significant effect on the effectiveness factor and can contribute to up to 50% of the hysteresis loop area for multiphase reactions in porous catalysts, indicating that pore blocking must be accounted for. Moreover, the pore blocking effects are significantly enhanced when the pore network is poorly connected and the pore-size distribution is wide, while the pore blocking effects are insensitive to the volume-averaged pore size. Multiphase catalyst material characterization and design should account for this effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Discrete model", "Hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane", "Hysteresis", "Multiphase reactions", "Pore blocking", "Pore network"], "IndexKeywords": ["Discrete modeling", "Hydrogenation of benzene", "Multiphase reactions", "Pore blocking", "Pore networks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955741139", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56248010100": {"Name": "Ye G.", "AuthorID": "56248010100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7410092325": {"Name": "Zhou X.", "AuthorID": "7410092325", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "7201517359": {"Name": "Yuan W.", "AuthorID": "7201517359", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "54790515100": {"Name": "Coppens M.", "AuthorID": "54790515100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
