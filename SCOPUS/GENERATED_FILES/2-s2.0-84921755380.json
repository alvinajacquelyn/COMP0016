As well as the increased cost of peri-operative investigations, blood transfusions, surgical instrumentation, implants and operating time, there is a well-documented increased length of stay which accounts for most of the actual costs associated with surgery. We compared revision surgery for infection with revision for other causes (pain, instability, aseptic loosening and fracture). Complete clinical, demographic and economic data were obtained for 168 consecutive revision TKAs performed at a tertiary referral centre between 2005 and 2012. Revision surgery for infection was associated with a mean length of stay more than double that of aseptic cases (21.5 vs 9.5 days, p < 0.0001). The mean cost of a revision for infection was more than three times that of an aseptic revision (\u00a330 011 ( SD 4514) vs \u00a39655 (SD 599.7), p < 0.0001). Current NHS tariffs do not fully reimburse the increased costs of providing a revision knee surgery service. Moreover, especially as greater costs are incurred for infected cases. These losses may adversely affect the provision of revision surgery in the NHS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee", "Female", "Great Britain", "Hospital Costs", "Humans", "Knee Prosthesis", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prosthesis Failure", "Prosthesis-Related Infections", "Reoperation", "State Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921755380", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"54795460200": {"Name": "Kallala R.F.", "AuthorID": "54795460200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Trauma and Orthopaedics Department, University College London Hospitals"}, "55626358400": {"Name": "Ibrahim M.S.", "AuthorID": "55626358400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Trauma and Orthopaedics Department, University College London Hospitals"}, "57191245777": {"Name": "Sarmah S.", "AuthorID": "57191245777", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Trauma and Orthopaedics Department, University College London Hospitals"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, University College London Hospitals"}, "37115008400": {"Name": "Vanhegan I.S.", "AuthorID": "37115008400", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital Stanmore"}}}
