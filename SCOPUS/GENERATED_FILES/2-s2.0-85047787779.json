Numerical ages were obtained for shells of Aequipecten paranensis from the Argentinean Puerto Madryn Formation, Facies Balneario La Lober\u00eda, \u201cEntrerriense Beds\u201d of the Salado Basin, and Paran\u00e1 Formation, and from the Camacho Formation (Uruguay). The 87Sr/86Sr ages fall into five age-groups that encompass the \u201cParanense\u201d flooding in the latest Serravalian-Messinian interval. For the Puerto Madryn Formation, the ages span the latest Serravalian to the Tortonian and are stratigraphically coherent with the transgressive phase (11.9\u201310.4 Ma) and the regressive phase (10.2\u20139.82 Ma and 9.40\u20139.05 Ma) of that unit. Ages of 8.85\u20137.95 Ma for the \u201cEntrerriense Beds\u201d show them to be Tortonian while the Facies Balneario La Lober\u00eda, and the Paran\u00e1 and Camacho formations span the age-range 7.50\u20136.00 Ma, comprising the Tortonian-Messinian interval. The regressive phase of the Puerto Madryn Formation, and the Facies Balneario La Lober\u00eda are respectively correlated with the basal and middle beds of the cliffs at Barranca Final, where the uppermost horizons of the Barranca Final Formation are exposed. The \u201cEntrerriense Beds\u201d are correlated with the \u201cCape Fairwheater Beds\u201d. Dating the \u201cParanense\u201d marine incursion permits a reappraisal of its paleogeography and differentiation of its deposits from those of the \u201cPatagoniense\u201d Sea. The flooding area was smaller than previously thought, with its northwestern-most boundary in the surroundings of the Santa Fe Province and its southernmost boundary in southern Santa Cruz Province. Moreover, the Paranaian Molluscan Bioprovince was coeval with the Valdesian Molluscan Bioprovince for 2.35 Ma and species included in the Aequipecten paranensis Zone lived for at least 5.90 Ma.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argentina", "Late miocene", "Paleogeography", "Sr-isotope", "Uruguay", "\u201cParanense\u201d sea"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047787779", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"7101889301": {"Name": "del R\u00edo C.J.", "AuthorID": "7101889301", "AffiliationID": "60006888", "AffiliationName": "Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales B.
