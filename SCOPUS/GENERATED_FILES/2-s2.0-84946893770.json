All rights reserved.Numerical methods are developed in the quantum transport calculations for electron in the waveguides with spin-orbital (Rashba) interaction. The methods are based on a hybrid mode-matching scheme in which the wavefunctions are expressed as the superposition of eigenmodes in the lead regions and in the device region the wavefunction is expressed on the discrete basis. Two versions are presented for the lead without and with the Rashba interaction. In the latter case the eigenmodes are obtained from a quadratic eigenproblem calculation. These methods are suitable for the systems with variable geometries or arbitrary potential profiles. The computation can be effectively accelerated by the sparse matrix technique. We also investigate the Fano-Rashba bound states in the Rashba waveguides by some nonlinear eigenstate calculation. This calculation is based on a mode-matching method and self-consistent results are obtained in our calculations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fano Resonance", "Hybrid mode-matching method", "Spin-orbital interaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arbitrary potentials", "Fano resonances", "Hybrid mode", "Mode matching method", "Quantum transport", "Sparse-matrix techniques", "Spin dependent transport", "Spin-orbital interactions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946893770", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55520900200": {"Name": "Xie H.", "AuthorID": "55520900200", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Hong Kong"}, "56399978800": {"Name": "Jiang F.", "AuthorID": "56399978800", "AffiliationID": "60082199", "AffiliationName": "School of Mathematics and Physics, Shanghai University of Electric Power"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
