The chain length of this polymer varies from five to several thousand orthophosphates. PolyP is distributed in the most of the living organisms and plays multiple functions in mammalian cells, it is important for blood coagulation, cancer, calcium precipitation, immune response and many others. Essential role of polyP is shown for mitochondria, from implication into energy metabolism and mitochondrial calcium handling to activation of permeability transition pore (PTP) and cell death. PolyP is a gliotransmitter which transmits the signal in astrocytes via activation of P2Y1 receptors and stimulation of phospholipase C. PolyP-induced calcium signal in astrocytes can be stimulated by different lengths of this polymer but only long chain polyP induces mitochondrial depolarization by inhibition of respiration and opening of the PTP. It leads to induction of astrocytic cell death which can be prevented by inhibition of PTP with cyclosporine A. Thus, medium- and short-length polyP plays role in signal transduction and mitochondrial metabolism of astrocytes and long chain of this polymer can be toxic for the cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrocytes", "Cell death", "Gliotransmitter", "Inorganic polyphosphate", "Mitochondria"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Death", "Humans", "Mitochondria", "Neurotransmitter Agents", "Polyphosphates", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957989714", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"]], "AuthorData": {"56081167500": {"Name": "Angelova P.", "AuthorID": "56081167500", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "55769001900": {"Name": "Baev A.", "AuthorID": "55769001900", "AffiliationID": "60071655", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology and Soil Science, National University of Uzbekistan"}, "7801310788": {"Name": "Berezhnov A.", "AuthorID": "7801310788", "AffiliationID": "60110604, 60021331", "AffiliationName": "Institute of the Cell Biophysics, Russian Academy of Science"}}}
