Copper (Cu) deficient (Cu/In + Ga = 0.76) CIGS films were designed to avoid the rather dangerous KCN treatment step for the removal of conductive minor phases of Cu2S/Cu2Se. A simple sodium (Na) treatment method was used to modify the morphology and electronic properties of the absorber and it clearly improved the solar cell performance. The SEM and XRD results testified a slightly increase of the grain size and (112) crystal orientation in the Na-incorporated CIGS thin films. From the Mott-schottky results, it can be seen that the functions of the Na treatment in our non-vacuum deposited CIGS are mainly used for defect passivation and reduction of charge recombination. Photovoltaic characteristics and j-V curve demonstrated that the dipping of CIGS films in 0.2 M NaCl solution for 20 minutes followed by selenization at 550 \u00b0C under selenium vapor resulted in the optimum photovoltaic performance, with j sc, V oc, FF and \u03b7 of the optimized solar cell of 29.30 mA cm-2, 0.564 V, 65.59% and 10.83%, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026426006", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56197503500": {"Name": "Wang M.", "AuthorID": "56197503500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "55976918000": {"Name": "Hossain M.", "AuthorID": "55976918000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London, Roberts Building"}, "57203183054": {"Name": "Choy K.", "AuthorID": "57203183054", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Materials Discovery, University College London, Roberts Building"}}}
