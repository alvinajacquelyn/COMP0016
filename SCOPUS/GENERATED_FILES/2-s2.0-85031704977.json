The governing equations are solved by using the concept of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). As already investigated in previous works, SPH fluid simulations suffer from numerical discusion which leads to a lower vorticity, a loss in turbulent details and finally in less realistic results. To solve this problem we propose a micropolar fluid model. The micropolar fluid model is a generalization of the classical Navier-Stokes equations, which are typically used in computer graphics to simulate fluids. In contrast to the classical Navier-Stokes model, micropolar fluids have a microstructure and therefore consider the rotational motion of fluid particles. In addition to the linear velocity field these fluids also have a field of microrotation which represents existing vortices and provides a source for new ones. However, classical micropolar materials are viscous and the translational and the rotational motion are coupled in a dissipative way. Since our goal is to simulate turbulent fluids, we introduce a novel modified micropolar material for inviscid fluids with a non-dissipative coupling. Our model can generate realistic turbulences, is linear and angular momentum conserving, can be easily integrated in existing SPH simulation methods and its computational overhead is negligible.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Incompressible fluids", "Micropolar fluids", "Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics", "Turbulence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational overheads", "Dissipative coupling", "Incompressible fluid", "Linear and angular momentums", "Micro-polar fluids", "Micropolar material", "Navier-Stokes model", "Smoothed particle hydrodynamics"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031704977", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"]], "AuthorData": {"22933788400": {"Name": "Bender J.", "AuthorID": "22933788400", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "RWTH Aachen University"}, "57196074008": {"Name": "Kugelstadt T.", "AuthorID": "57196074008", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "RWTH Aachen University"}, "56315477100": {"Name": "Koschier D.", "AuthorID": "56315477100", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "RWTH Aachen University"}, "57191923058": {"Name": "Weiler M.", "AuthorID": "57191923058", "AffiliationID": "60011226", "AffiliationName": "TU Darmstadt"}}}
