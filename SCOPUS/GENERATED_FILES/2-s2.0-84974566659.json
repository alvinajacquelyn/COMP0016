While this resembles directly inspired by the Talbot-Lau implementation of grating interferometry, the aim of the source mask and its effect on the acquired images are different. The individual \"sourcelets\" are much larger than in grating methods, and then still spatially incoherent; however, their use allows (a) exploiting cheap and large focal spot sources and (b) reducing the source spot size from the usual 70-100 \u03bcm typically used in EI to few tens of \u03bcm, which enables the realisation of more compact setups. However, in EI, multiple sources create images shifted by one detector pixel with respect to the other, imposing the use of an image restoration algorithm. Here, we show that the approach is feasible by deconvolving differential phase-contrast image profiles acquired with three separate sources, and comparing results with simulation predictions for equivalent profiles generated by a single source. We also show that this enables reducing the system length from the 2 m used so far to 1 m.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Differential phase contrast", "Grating interferometry", "Grating methods", "Image restoration algorithms", "Multiple source", "Simulation prediction", "Source spot size", "X-ray phase-contrast imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974566659", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55362547500": {"Name": "Basta D.", "AuthorID": "55362547500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "55320675800": {"Name": "Vittoria F.", "AuthorID": "55320675800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "55985279700": {"Name": "Astolfo A.", "AuthorID": "55985279700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}}}
