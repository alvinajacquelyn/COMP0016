Alcohols of C8-C16 chain lengths were tested and the results of these experiments were compared with those for corresponding hydrocarbon molecules. Alcohols had higher ignition delays than the various hydrocarbons tested. This is believed to be due to the increased difficulty of both hydrogen abstraction and isomerization, caused by the higher electronegativity of the oxygen atoms in alcohols compared to carbon atoms. Additionally, the location of the hydroxyl group was found to affect ignition delay; molecules in which the hydroxyl group was closer to the centre of the carbon chain were observed to have longer ignition delays. In addition, both higher degree of unsaturation and methyl branching were shown to increase the ignition delay of alcohols, as was expected. Due to higher ignition delays, alcohol combustion resulted in higher in-cylinder temperatures than those corresponding to hydrocarbon combustion, giving rise to greater NOx emissions. In the case of exhaust particulate matter, a shift was observed for alcohols towards a greater number of nucleation particles, in comparison to corresponding alkane molecules.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol", "Diesel ignition delay", "Fuel effect on NOx", "Fuel molecular structure", "Oxygenated biofuels", "Particulate emissions"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combustion performance", "Cylinder temperatures", "Degree of unsaturations", "Exhaust particulate matter", "Hydrocarbon combustion", "Hydrocarbon molecules", "Hydrogen abstraction", "Ignition delays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926360786", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56581667300": {"Name": "Koivisto E.", "AuthorID": "56581667300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003607190": {"Name": "Ladommatos N.", "AuthorID": "7003607190", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7402444146": {"Name": "Gold M.", "AuthorID": "7402444146", "AffiliationID": "60028556", "AffiliationName": "BP Plc, Fuels and Lubricants Research, Technology Centre"}}}
