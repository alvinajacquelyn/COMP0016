It creates significant physical and psychosexual morbidity, and presents considerable therapeutic challenges. The existing literature is limited. Aim: To describe and share our updated cumulative experience of a cohort of patients with penile lymphoedema. Methods: This was a retrospective review of the case records of patients with chronic penile lymphoedema seen in two dedicated male genital dermatology clinics between January 2011 and July 2016. Results: In total, 41 cases were identified. Over a third had Crohn disease (CD) (which was occult in one-third of these), and over a third had serological evidence of streptococcal infection. All patients responded to systemic antibiotics and specialized urological surgery circumcision and excision). Conclusions: Penile lymphoedema should be investigated to exclude underlying pathology especially CD and streptococcal infection. Treatment with antibiotics should be considered early and long term to try to preserve the foreskin: most patients are uncircumcised. Some patients may benefit from a course or courses of oral steroids. The development of gross dysfunction of the prepuce usually dictates circumcision and excision of lymphoedematous tissue once the situation is medically stabilized.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Chronic Disease", "Circumcision, Male", "Crohn Disease", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Humans", "Lymphedema", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Penile Diseases", "Penis", "Retrospective Studies", "Streptococcal Infections", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050491703", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"55504029200": {"Name": "Shim T.N.", "AuthorID": "55504029200", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University College Hospital"}, "57191363603": {"Name": "Doiron P.R.", "AuthorID": "57191363603", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine"}, "7102435767": {"Name": "Bunker C.B.", "AuthorID": "7102435767", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University College Hospital"}, "7006658003": {"Name": "Francis N.", "AuthorID": "7006658003", "AffiliationID": "60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Charing Cross Hospital"}, "7003826887": {"Name": "Minhas S.", "AuthorID": "7003826887", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "7202029505": {"Name": "Hawkins D.", "AuthorID": "7202029505", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV/GUM, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}, "7004717766": {"Name": "Dinneen M.", "AuthorID": "7004717766", "AffiliationID": "60002484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital"}}}
