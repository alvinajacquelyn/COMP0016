Here we show that in rats, genetic silencing of the largest population of brainstem vagal preganglionic neurons residing in the brainstem's dorsal vagal motor nucleus dramatically impairs exercise capacity, while optogenetic recruitment of the same neuronal population enhances cardiac contractility and prolongs exercise endurance. These data provide direct experimental evidence that parasympathetic vagal drive generated by a defined CNS circuit determines the ability to exercise. Decreased activity and/or gradual loss of the identified neuronal cell group provides a neurophysiological basis for the progressive decline of exercise capacity with aging and in diverse disease states.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Animals", "Brain", "Brain Stem", "Cardiac Output", "Exercise Test", "Exercise Tolerance", "Female", "Heart Ventricles", "Humans", "Male", "Medulla Oblongata", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Contraction", "Neurons", "Optogenetics", "Oxygen Consumption", "Parasympathetic Nervous System", "Physical Endurance", "Rats", "Vagus Nerve"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019561854", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56168818300": {"Name": "Machhada A.", "AuthorID": "56168818300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56441808800": {"Name": "Trapp S.", "AuthorID": "56441808800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "13004689900": {"Name": "Marina N.", "AuthorID": "13004689900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "8768192800": {"Name": "Ackland G.L.", "AuthorID": "8768192800", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Translational Medicine and Therapeutics, William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.V.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Neuroscience, Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7004107686": {"Name": "Lythgoe M.F.", "AuthorID": "7004107686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7401884627": {"Name": "Stephens R.C.M.", "AuthorID": "7401884627", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospitals, NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "47761759900": {"Name": "Whittle J.", "AuthorID": "47761759900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56353446000": {"Name": "Kasparov S.", "AuthorID": "56353446000", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Bristol"}}}
