Compositional changes in both the HMS substrate and the glass-ceramic coating are reviewed and discussed with respect to the electrical properties of the uncoated and coated HMS before and after thermal cycles from RT to 600 \u00b0C in air. The formation of a Si-deficient layer (MnSi) on the uncoated HMS surface is due to the reaction between the HMS and oxygen at 600 \u00b0C, thus contributing to a lower power factor in comparison with the as-sintered HMS. Coated HMS samples (after thermal cycles RT-600 \u00b0C) show a lower electrical resistivity and a significantly higher power factor in comparison with the uncoated ones. The glass-ceramic coating is self-reparable at 600 \u00b0C, as demonstrated by the complete sealing of an induced scratch on its surface.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coating", "Glass-ceramic", "Oxidation", "Thermoelectric"], "IndexKeywords": ["Compositional changes", "Higher manganese silicides", "Oxidation protection", "Power factors", "Thermoelectric", "Thermoelectrics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040462263", "SubjectAreas": [["Ceramics and Composites", "MATE", "2503"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"7004749273": {"Name": "Salvo M.", "AuthorID": "7004749273", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Torino, Department of Applied Science and Technology"}, "6507233812": {"Name": "Smeacetto F.", "AuthorID": "6507233812", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Torino, Department of Applied Science and Technology"}, "57194567412": {"Name": "D'Isanto F.", "AuthorID": "57194567412", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Torino, Department of Applied Science and Technology"}, "17347220500": {"Name": "Viola G.", "AuthorID": "17347220500", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Torino, Department of Applied Science and Technology"}, "36127509300": {"Name": "Demitri P.", "AuthorID": "36127509300", "AffiliationID": "60012162", "AffiliationName": "Politecnico di Torino, Department of Applied Science and Technology"}, "57190968816": {"Name": "Gucci F.", "AuthorID": "57190968816", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60112812", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering & Materials Science and Nanoforce Technology Ltd., Queen Mary University of London"}, "7006407343": {"Name": "Reece M.", "AuthorID": "7006407343", "AffiliationID": "60022109, 60112812", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering & Materials Science and Nanoforce Technology Ltd., Queen Mary University of London"}}}
