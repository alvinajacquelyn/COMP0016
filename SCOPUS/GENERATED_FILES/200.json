SAA is an acute-phase reactant synthetized largely by hepatocytes under the transcriptional regulation of proinflammatory cytokines. The kidney is the major involved organ with proteinuria as first clinical manifestation; renal biopsy is the commonest diagnostic investigation. Targeted anti-inflammatory treatment promotes normalization of circulating SAA levels preventing amyloid deposition and renal damage. Novel therapies aimed at promoting clearance of existing amyloid deposits soon may be an effective treatment approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AA amyloidosis", "Autoinflammatory syndrome", "Congo red staining", "Rheumatoid arthritis", "SAA1 gene", "SAP scintigraphy", "Serum amyloid A", "Systemic amyloidosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloidosis", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents", "Humans", "Inflammation", "Kidney", "Serum Amyloid A Protein", "Therapies, Investigational", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052908085", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"]], "AuthorData": {"56004113900": {"Name": "Papa R.", "AuthorID": "56004113900", "AffiliationID": "60025153, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Autoinflammatory Diseases and Immunodeficiencies Centre, Pediatric and Rheumatology Clinic, Giannina Gaslini Institute, University of Genoa"}, "7004915734": {"Name": "Lachmann H.J.", "AuthorID": "7004915734", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Royal Free Campus, University College Medical School"}}}
