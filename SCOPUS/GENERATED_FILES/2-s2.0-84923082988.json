Measurement artefacts may limit the use of OCT to MS research. Objective: An expert task force convened with the aim to provide guidance on the use of validated quality control (QC) criteria for the use of OCT in MS research and clinical trials. Methods: A prospective multi-centre (n = 13) study. Peripapillary ring scan QC rating of an OCT training set (n = 50) was followed by a test set (n = 50). Inter-rater agreement was calculated using kappa statistics. Results were discussed at a round table after the assessment had taken place. Results: The inter-rater QC agreement was substantial (kappa = 0.7). Disagreement was found highest for judging signal strength (kappa = 0.40). Future steps to resolve these issues were discussed. Conclusion: Substantial agreement for QC assessment was achieved with aid of the OSCAR-IB criteria. The task force has developed a website for free online training and QC certification. The criteria may prove useful for future research and trials in MS using OCT as a secondary outcome measure in a multicentre setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrophy", "Multiple sclerosis", "Outcome measurement", "Progressive"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atrophy", "Humans", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Prospective Studies", "Quality Control", "Retina", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923082988", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24345306300": {"Name": "Schippling S.", "AuthorID": "24345306300", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimmunology and MS Research Section, University Hospital Zurich"}, "35200468000": {"Name": "Balk L.J.", "AuthorID": "35200468000", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "MS Centre Amsterdam, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7003884162": {"Name": "Costello F.", "AuthorID": "7003884162", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "University of Calgary"}, "55443616500": {"Name": "Albrecht P.", "AuthorID": "55443616500", "AffiliationID": "60025310", "AffiliationName": "Medical Faculty, Heinrich- Heine University Dsseldorf"}, "7004524080": {"Name": "Balcer L.", "AuthorID": "7004524080", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "New York University, School of Medicine"}, "35290391600": {"Name": "Calabresi P.A.", "AuthorID": "35290391600", "AffiliationID": "60001555", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins Hospital"}, "7102315536": {"Name": "Frederiksen J.L.", "AuthorID": "7102315536", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "University of Copenhagen"}, "7004256856": {"Name": "Frohman E.", "AuthorID": "7004256856", "AffiliationID": "60009415", "AffiliationName": "University of Texas, Southwestern Medical Center"}, "8675686800": {"Name": "Green A.J.", "AuthorID": "8675686800", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "MS Center, University of California"}, "6603948507": {"Name": "Klistorner A.", "AuthorID": "6603948507", "AffiliationID": "60013933, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Save Sight Institute, University of Sydney"}, "24734115700": {"Name": "Outteryck O.", "AuthorID": "24734115700", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "University of Lille Nord de France"}, "7005016182": {"Name": "Vermersch P.", "AuthorID": "7005016182", "AffiliationID": "60104665", "AffiliationName": "University of Lille Nord de France"}, "12766456100": {"Name": "Paul F.", "AuthorID": "12766456100", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "NeuroCure Clinical Research Center (NCRC), Clinical and Experimental, Universitatsmedizin Berlin"}, "57203026074": {"Name": "Plant G.T.", "AuthorID": "57203026074", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60016691, 60020736", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, St. Thomas Hospital"}, "48461964400": {"Name": "Traber G.", "AuthorID": "48461964400", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Zurich"}, "6602074839": {"Name": "Villoslada P.", "AuthorID": "6602074839", "AffiliationID": "60030315, 60025847", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neuroimmunology, Institute of Biomedical Research August, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona"}, "56892581600": {"Name": "Wolf S.", "AuthorID": "56892581600", "AffiliationID": "60010987, 60020486", "AffiliationName": "Bern University Hospital, University of Bern"}, "7006826396": {"Name": "Petzold A.", "AuthorID": "7006826396", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "VU University Medical Centre"}}}
