I examine the heterogeneity in private school value-added across different subjects, urban and rural areas, medium of instruction, and across age groups. Further, I also estimate private school effects on children's self-efficacy and agency. In rural areas, I find a substantial positive effect (>. 0.5 SD) of private schools on English, no effect on Mathematics and heterogeneous effects on Telugu for 8-10-year old students; at 15. years, there are modest effects (<. 0.2 SD) on Mathematics and Telugu receptive vocabulary. I find no evidence of a positive effect in urban areas or on psychosocial skills. Results on comparable test domains and age groups correspond closely with, and further extend, estimates from a parallel experimental evaluation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Education", "India", "Non-cognitive skills", "Private schooling", "Value-added models"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84912086643", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"55579008400": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "55579008400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}}}
