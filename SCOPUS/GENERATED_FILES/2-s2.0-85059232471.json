We aimed to determine the risk of persistent HEV infection in patients with primary or secondary antibody deficiency. Methods Two hundred forty-five antibody-deficient patients receiving regular immunoglobulin replacement therapy were tested for HEV RNA and anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG). Immunoglobulin products and plasma specimens obtained from 9 antibody-deficient patients before and after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy, 5 recently treated patients with persistent HEV infection, and 5 healthy patients recovered from acute HEV infection were analyzed for anti-HEV IgG and for antibody reacting with HEV antigen. Results No antibody-deficient patient had detectable plasma HEV RNA. Anti-HEV IgG was detected in 38.8% of patients. All 10 immunoglobulin products tested contained anti-HEV capable of neutralizing HEV antigen. Plasma samples collected following IVIG infusion therapy demonstrated a higher anti-HEV IgG level and neutralizing activity, compared with samples collected before IVIG therapy. Neutralizing activity was similar to that in healthy patients with recent acute HEV infection. Conclusion The risk of persistent HEV infection in patients with antibody deficiency appears extremely low. This may be due to passive seroprotection afforded by the ubiquitous presence of anti-HEV in immunoglobulin replacement products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antibody deficiency", "chronic infection", "Hepatitis E virus", "immunoglobulin", "IVIG"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Hepatitis Antibodies", "Hepatitis E", "Hepatitis E virus", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Immunoglobulin M", "Immunoglobulins, Intravenous", "Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes", "Male", "Middle Aged", "RNA, Viral"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059232471", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55489417500": {"Name": "Ankcorn M.", "AuthorID": "55489417500", "AffiliationID": "60030968", "AffiliationName": "Transfusion Microbiology, National Health Service Blood and Transplant"}, "8836379300": {"Name": "Ijaz S.", "AuthorID": "8836379300", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Blood Borne Virus Unit, Virus Reference Department, Public Health England, National Infection Service"}, "56945667500": {"Name": "Tedder R.S.", "AuthorID": "56945667500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7003542687": {"Name": "Warburton F.", "AuthorID": "7003542687", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Statistics, Modelling, and Economics Department, Public Health England"}, "57201213267": {"Name": "Moreira F.", "AuthorID": "57201213267", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Free London National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "16551448500": {"Name": "Symes A.", "AuthorID": "16551448500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Free London National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "35965274600": {"Name": "Buckland M.S.", "AuthorID": "35965274600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "22936207500": {"Name": "Workman S.", "AuthorID": "22936207500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Immunology, Royal Free London National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "57213673329": {"Name": "Lowe D.M.", "AuthorID": "57213673329", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}}}
