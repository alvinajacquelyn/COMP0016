In addition to their expression of a wide array of host modulatory factors, several recent studies have suggested that poxviruses may have evolved unique mechanisms to shunt or evade host detection. These potential mechanisms include mimicry of apoptotic bodies by mature virions (MVs), the use of viral sub-structures termed lateral bodies for the packaging and delivery of host modulators, and the formation of a second, \u201ccloaked\u201d form of infectious extracellular virus (EVs). Here we discuss these various strategies and how they may facilitate poxvirus immune evasion. Finally we propose a model for the exploitation of the cellular exosome pathway for the formation of EVs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Exocytosis", "Exosome", "Immune evasion", "Vaccinia virus", "Virus entry"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Immune Evasion", "Poxviridae"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941036862", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"37065722300": {"Name": "Bidgood S.", "AuthorID": "37065722300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council-Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}, "14121881600": {"Name": "Mercer J.", "AuthorID": "14121881600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council-Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London"}}}
