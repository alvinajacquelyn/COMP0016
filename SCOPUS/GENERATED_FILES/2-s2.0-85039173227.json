In sub-Saharan Africa, seroprevalence is high in the general population, but little is known about the transmission routes or the prevalence of coinfection with blood-borne viruses, HBV, HCV and HIV. Methods: To further explore the characteristics of PARV4 in this setting, with a particular focus on the prevalence and significance of coinfection, we screened a cohort of 695 individuals recruited from Durban and Kimberley (South Africa) and Gaborone (Botswana) for PARV4 IgG and DNA, as well as documenting HIV, HBV and HCV status. Results: Within these cohorts, 69% of subjects were HIV-positive. We identified no cases of HCV by PCR, but 7.4% were positive for HBsAg. PARV4 IgG was positive in 42%; seroprevalence was higher in adults (69%) compared to children (21%) (p<0.0001) and in HIV-positive (52%) compared to HIV-negative individuals (24%) (p<0.0001), but there was no association with HBsAg status. We developed an on-line tool to allow visualization of coinfection data (https://purl.oclc.org/coinfection-viz). We identified five subjects who were PCR-positive for PARV4 genotype-3. Ex vivo CD8+ T cell responses spanned the entire PARV4 proteome and we propose a novel HLA-B*57:03-restricted epitope within the NS protein. Conclusions: This characterisation of PARV4 infection provides enhanced insights into the epidemiology of infection and co-infection in African cohorts, and provides the foundations for planning further focused studies to elucidate transmission pathways, immune responses, and the clinical significance of this organism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039173227", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7103090775": {"Name": "Sharp C.P.", "AuthorID": "7103090775", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Edinburgh Genomics, University of Edinburgh"}, "56556163600": {"Name": "Gregory W.F.", "AuthorID": "56556163600", "AffiliationID": "60026158, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "Roslin Institute, University of Edinburgh"}, "57193426588": {"Name": "Hattingh L.", "AuthorID": "57193426588", "AffiliationID": "101562261", "AffiliationName": "Kimberley Hospital"}, "57191410214": {"Name": "Daniels S.", "AuthorID": "57191410214", "AffiliationID": "101562261", "AffiliationName": "Kimberley Hospital"}, "57191967477": {"Name": "van Zyl A.", "AuthorID": "57191967477", "AffiliationID": "101562261", "AffiliationName": "Kimberley Hospital"}, "57198088957": {"Name": "Jooste P.", "AuthorID": "57198088957", "AffiliationID": "101562261", "AffiliationName": "Kimberley Hospital"}, "56185778900": {"Name": "Malik A.", "AuthorID": "56185778900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}, "34869133500": {"Name": "Adland E.", "AuthorID": "34869133500", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}, "7003741802": {"Name": "Goulder P.J.R.", "AuthorID": "7003741802", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford"}, "13807311800": {"Name": "Carlson J.M.", "AuthorID": "13807311800", "AffiliationID": "60021726", "AffiliationName": "Microsoft Research"}, "57191966074": {"Name": "Wareing S.", "AuthorID": "57191966074", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60170323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "23050705400": {"Name": "Klenerman P.", "AuthorID": "23050705400", "AffiliationID": "60008323, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR, Biomedical Research Centre, John Radcliffe Hospital"}, "57203255155": {"Name": "Matthews P.C.", "AuthorID": "57203255155", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "26647836800": {"Name": "Ogwu A.", "AuthorID": "26647836800", "AffiliationID": "60107841", "AffiliationName": "Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership"}, "7403082754": {"Name": "Shapiro R.", "AuthorID": "7403082754", "AffiliationID": "60107841", "AffiliationName": "Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership"}, "55486903800": {"Name": "Riddell L.", "AuthorID": "55486903800", "AffiliationID": "60001613", "AffiliationName": "Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust"}, "8206439900": {"Name": "Chen F.", "AuthorID": "8206439900", "AffiliationID": "60007312", "AffiliationName": "Royal Berkshire Hospital"}, "6507164421": {"Name": "Ndung'u T.", "AuthorID": "6507164421", "AffiliationID": "60017135, 60010499", "AffiliationName": "HIV Pathogenesis Program, Nelson R.
