Health Information and Libraries Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Health Libraries GroupBackground: Health libraries contribute to many activities of a health care organisation. Impact assessment needs to capture that range of contributions. Objectives: To develop and pilot a generic impact questionnaire that: (1) could be used routinely across all English NHS libraries; (2) built on previous impact surveys; and (3) was reliable and robust. Methods: This collaborative project involved: (1) literature search; (2) analysis of current best practice and baseline survey of use of current tools and requirements; (3) drafting and piloting the questionnaire; and (4) analysis of the results, revision and plans for roll out. Findings: The framework selected was the International Standard Methods And Procedures For Assessing The Impact Of Libraries (ISO 16439). The baseline survey (n = 136 library managers) showed that existing tools were not used, and impact assessment was variable. The generic questionnaire developed used a Critical Incident Technique. Analysis of the findings (n = 214 health staff and students), plus comparisons with previous impact studies indicated that the questionnaire should capture the impact for all types of health libraries. Conclusions: The collaborative project successfully piloted a generic impact questionnaire that, subject to further validation, should apply to many types of health library and information services.", "AuthorKeywords": ["evidence-based library and information practice (EBLIP)", "evidence-based practice (EBP)", "impact", "information services", "libraries, health care", "outcome measures", "surveys"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benchmarking", "Evidence-Based Practice", "Humans", "Information Services", "Libraries, Medical", "Quality Assurance, Health Care", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050530135", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"], ["Health Information Management", "HEAL", "3605"]], "AuthorData": {"35274525800": {"Name": "Ayre S.", "AuthorID": "35274525800", "AffiliationID": "60018936", "AffiliationName": "George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust"}, "6602957272": {"Name": "Brettle A.", "AuthorID": "6602957272", "AffiliationID": "60008250", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing, Midwifery, Social Work and Social Sciences, University of Salford"}, "15051781600": {"Name": "Gilroy D.", "AuthorID": "15051781600", "AffiliationID": "114573326", "AffiliationName": "Health Education England"}, "14619233300": {"Name": "Knock D.", "AuthorID": "14619233300", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57203118413": {"Name": "Mitchelmore R.", "AuthorID": "57203118413", "AffiliationID": "60175889", "AffiliationName": "Isle of Wight NHS Trust"}, "57203121988": {"Name": "Pattison S.", "AuthorID": "57203121988", "AffiliationID": "60170516, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57212961693": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57212961693", "AffiliationID": "60028154", "AffiliationName": "Mid Cheshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57200586077": {"Name": "Turner J.", "AuthorID": "57200586077", "AffiliationID": "60026349", "AffiliationName": "East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
