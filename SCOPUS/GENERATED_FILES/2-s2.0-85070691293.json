This paper examines the role of the international press, both as an actor and as a medium for the circulation of urban planning models. We aim to deepen the theoretical notions on the role of media, particularly the written press, in building narratives of \u2018urban models\u2019, and their circulation in other contexts. And second, by extending the reaches of multi-sited ethnography as the main methodological approach to follow policy mobility. This research monitored, and analysed news items published about Medell\u00edn on the digital editions of several newspapers across the globe between 2004 and 2017. The resulting examination shows, firstly, how the changes of the image of the city has been portrayed over time, with a growth of news items highlighting Medell\u00edn's urban model as an inspirational source for other cities in the world. Secondly, the research shows the importance of international media for building a particular storytelling about urban transformations. We argue that newspapers constitute a key informational infrastructure for urban policy mobility contributing to amplify mythical narratives of \u2018urban models\u2019 and to institute new metrics of good governance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Medell\u00edn model", "Multi-sited ethnography", "Policy mobility", "Press", "Storytelling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070691293", "SubjectAreas": [["Development", "SOCI", "3303"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Urban Studies", "SOCI", "3322"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"57210428958": {"Name": "Duque Franco I.", "AuthorID": "57210428958", "AffiliationID": "60055696", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, Universidad Nacional de Colombia"}, "57200282920": {"Name": "Ortiz C.", "AuthorID": "57200282920", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Bartlett Development Planning Unit, University College London"}}}
