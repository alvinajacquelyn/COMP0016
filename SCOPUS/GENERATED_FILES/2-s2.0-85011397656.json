This advancement ignited a revolution in plant evolutionary genomics by allowing direct observations of past molecular diversity. Analyses of genomes sequenced from temporally distributed samples of Gossypium sp., Phytophthora infestans and Arabidopsis thaliana improved our understanding of the evolutionary rates and time scales at which genome remodeling takes place. Comparison of historical samples of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) with their present-day counterparts enabled assessment of selection during different stages of domestication. These examples show how aDNA already improved our evolutionary inferences. Increasing quality and amount of sequencing data retrieved from historical plants will further advance our understanding of plant evolution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["DNA, Ancient", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genome, Plant", "Genomics", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011397656", "SubjectAreas": [["Plant Science", "AGRI", "1110"]], "AuthorData": {"56441701500": {"Name": "Gutaker R.", "AuthorID": "56441701500", "AffiliationID": "60020329", "AffiliationName": "Research Group for Ancient Genomics and Evolution, Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology"}, "14420828500": {"Name": "Burbano H.", "AuthorID": "14420828500", "AffiliationID": "60020329", "AffiliationName": "Research Group for Ancient Genomics and Evolution, Department of Molecular Biology, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology"}}}
