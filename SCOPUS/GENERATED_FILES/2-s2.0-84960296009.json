Parathyroid hormone (PTH), the only osteoanabolic drug currently approved, is also a vasodilator. We investigated whether the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME might alter the effect of PTH on bone by blocking its vasodilatory effect. BALB/c mice received 28 daily injections of PTH[1-34] (80\u03bcg/kg/day) or L-NAME (30mg/kg/day), alone or in combination. Hindlimb blood perfusion was measured by laser Doppler imaging. Bone architecture, turnover and mechanical properties in the femur were analysed respectively by micro-CT, histomorphometry and three-point bending. PTH increased hindlimb blood flow by >30% within 10min of injection (P<0.001). Co-treatment with L-NAME blocked the action of PTH on blood flow, whereas L-NAME alone had no effect. PTH treatment increased femoral cortical bone volume and formation rate by 20% and 110%, respectively (P<0.001). PTH had no effect on trabecular bone volume in the femoral metaphysis although trabecular thickness and number were increased and decreased by 25%, respectively. Co-treatment with L-NAME restricted the PTH-stimulated increase in cortical bone formation but had no clear-cut effects in trabecular bone. Co-treatment with L-NAME did not affect the mechanical strength in femurs induced by iPTH. These results suggest that NO-mediated vasorelaxation plays partly a role in the anabolic action of PTH on cortical bone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bone blood flow", "Cortical bone", "Nitric oxide", "Parathyroid hormone", "Vasodilation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Bone and Bones", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Nitric Oxide", "Osteoblasts", "Parathyroid Hormone", "Vasodilation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960296009", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"36459508600": {"Name": "Gohin S.", "AuthorID": "36459508600", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6505971246": {"Name": "Marenzana M.", "AuthorID": "6505971246", "AffiliationID": "60007247, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology, University of Oxford"}, "24480634300": {"Name": "Carriero A.", "AuthorID": "24480634300", "AffiliationID": "60010339", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Florida Institute of Technology"}, "7003686898": {"Name": "Arnett T.", "AuthorID": "7003686898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57203200421": {"Name": "Chenu C.", "AuthorID": "57203200421", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}, "57206490569": {"Name": "Pitsillides A.", "AuthorID": "57206490569", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College"}}}
