This method exploits knowledge that optical parameters are determined by a limited number of classes to iteratively improve their estimate. Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach allows for accurate recovery of absorption and scattering in two and three dimensions, and delivers superior image quality with respect to traditional reconstruction-only approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chromophores", "image reconstruction", "quantitative photoacoustic tomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absorption and scatterings", "Classification methods", "Number of class", "Numerical experiments", "Optical energy", "Optical parameter", "Photoacoustic tomography", "Three dimensions", "Acoustics", "Algorithms", "Cluster Analysis", "Diffusion", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Light", "Models, Theoretical", "Nephelometry and Turbidimetry", "Normal Distribution", "Optics and Photonics", "Oxygen", "Scattering, Radiation", "Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951956619", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56038057300": {"Name": "Malone E.", "AuthorID": "56038057300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering"}, "7201575253": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "7201575253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Computer Science"}}}
