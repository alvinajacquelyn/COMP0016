Access to laboratory facilities is limited; therefore, on-site testing warrants attention. Objectives: To determine the accuracy of on-site tests to detect anemia in pregnancy. Search strategy: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched from inception until March 2016, with no language restrictions, using the terms \u201cpregnancy,\u201d \u201can(a)emia,\u201d and \u201ch(a)emoglobin.\u201d. Selection criteria: Studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of on-site hemoglobin tests versus laboratory-based reference tests during pregnancy were included. Data collection and analysis: Study characteristics and true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative rates were extracted. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and post-test probabilities were calculated. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level of less than 110 g/L. Main results: Ten studies (4239 participants) were assessed. Copper sulfate provided 97% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI] 88%\u2013100%) and 71% specificity (95% CI 55%\u201385%); the Sahli method provided 86% sensitivity (95% CI 75%\u201394%) and 83% specificity (95% CI 68%\u201393%); and HemoCue provided 85% sensitivity (95% CI 79%\u201390%) and 80% specificity (95% CI 76%\u201383%). Conclusions: Some on-site tests are accurate and should be made widely available to improve detection of anemia in pregnancy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anemia", "On-site tests", "Point-of-care tests", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal care", "Screening"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anemia", "Developing Countries", "Female", "Humans", "Point-of-Care Systems", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic", "Prenatal Care", "Prenatal Diagnosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027684465", "SubjectAreas": [["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57188844211": {"Name": "Sobhy S.", "AuthorID": "57188844211", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Women's Health Research Unit, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55229157600": {"Name": "Rogozinska E.", "AuthorID": "55229157600", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Multidisciplinary Evidence Synthesis Hub, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57204348002": {"Name": "Khan K.", "AuthorID": "57204348002", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Multidisciplinary Evidence Synthesis Hub, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
