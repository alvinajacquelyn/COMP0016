We suggest that an interesting insight into anticipating synchronization can be obtained by the renormalization of the time scale in the driven system. Our approach directly links the feedback delay of the driven system with the renormalized time scale of the driven system, identifying the main component in the anticipating synchronization paradigm and suggesting an alternative method to generate anticipating and lagging synchronization.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anticipating synchronization", "Driven system", "Driver systems", "Feedback delay", "Renormalization", "Time-scales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971222231", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"35229983200": {"Name": "Hayashi Y.", "AuthorID": "35229983200", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Brain Embodiment Lab, School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading"}, "9275024700": {"Name": "Nasuto S.", "AuthorID": "9275024700", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Brain Embodiment Lab, School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading"}, "57189464377": {"Name": "Eberle H.", "AuthorID": "57189464377", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Brain Embodiment Lab, School of Biological Sciences, University of Reading"}}}
