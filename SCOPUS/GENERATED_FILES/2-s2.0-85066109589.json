However, BIM has not been widely implemented in the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase. As-is information for the majority of existing buildings is not complete and even outdated or incorrect. Lack of accurate and complete as-is information is still one of the key reasons leading to the low-level efficiency in O&M. BIM performs as an intelligent platform and a database that stores, links, extracts and exchanges information in construction projects. It has shown promising opportunities and advantages in BIM applications for the improvement in O&M. Hence, an effective and convenient approach to record as-is conditions of the existing buildings and create as-is BIM objects would be the essential step for improving efficiency and effectiveness of O&M, and furthermore possibly refurbishment of the building. Many researchers have paid attention to different systems and approaches for automated and real-time object recognition in past decades. This paper summarizes state-of-the-art statistical matching-based object recognition methods and then presents the image-based Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM object creation application, which extracts object information by simply conducting point-and-click operations. Furthermore, the object recognition research system is introduced, including recognizing structure object types and their corresponding materials. This paper combines the multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) with the fuzzy set theory to be Fuzzy-MAUT, since the MAUT allows complex and powerful combinations of various criteria and fuzzy set theory assists improving the performance of this system. With the goal of creating an effective method for as-is IFC BIM objects construction, this image-based object recognition system and its recognition process are further validated and tested. Key challenges and promising opportunities are also addressed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["as-is Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) BIM object", "fuzzy set theory", "Fuzzy-MAUT", "image-based object recognition"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066109589", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"57194416586": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "57194416586", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56717065200": {"Name": "Lu Q.", "AuthorID": "56717065200", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "56170214300": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "56170214300", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}}}
