Methods: A survey was conducted among 40 respondents from 33 pediatric epilepsy surgery centers worldwide on the weight assigned to diagnostic tests used to define the EZ and EC, how EC is viewed, and how surgeries are planned for foci near or in eloquent cortex. Results: A descriptive analysis was performed that revealed considerable variation in the use of diagnostic tests and resective strategies toward EZ and EC. Significance: The wide variation in strategies may contribute to undesirable outcomes characterized by poor seizure control with added deficits and underscores the need to establish best practices in pediatric epilepsy surgery. The survey data were used to formulate a set of recommendations to help minimize deficits and to report them consistently.", "AuthorKeywords": ["critical cortex", "deficit scale", "epilepsy surgery strategies", "epileptogenic zone"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cerebral Cortex", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neurosurgeons", "Neurosurgical Procedures", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051125120", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7006281790": {"Name": "Jayakar P.", "AuthorID": "7006281790", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, Brain Institute, Nicklaus Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "12774822200": {"Name": "Jayakar A.", "AuthorID": "12774822200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Epilepsy, Nicklaus Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7004958140": {"Name": "Libenson M.", "AuthorID": "7004958140", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Children\u2019s Hospital Boston"}, "7003564550": {"Name": "Arzimanoglou A.", "AuthorID": "7003564550", "AffiliationID": "102078625", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Epileptology, Sleep Disorders and Functional Neurology in Children, University Hospitals of Lyon"}, "6603750073": {"Name": "Rydenhag B.", "AuthorID": "6603750073", "AffiliationID": "100637407", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Research Group, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical & Experimental Epilepsy, Great Ormond Street Hospital, University College London"}, "56638926400": {"Name": "Bhatia S.", "AuthorID": "56638926400", "AffiliationID": "106744380", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Miami Children\u2019s Hospital"}, "7004879112": {"Name": "Tassi L.", "AuthorID": "7004879112", "AffiliationID": "101559284", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Claudio Munari Epilepsy Surgery Centre"}, "8361006100": {"Name": "Lachhwani D.", "AuthorID": "8361006100", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Cleveland Clinic"}, "35557409000": {"Name": "Gaillard W.D.", "AuthorID": "35557409000", "AffiliationID": "60005723", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s National Health System"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
