Instruments capable of measuring the requisite data typically have limited temporal resolution, which prevents the application of this modality in imaging transient haemodynamic events which are of significant clinical interest. In this work we overcome this problem by applying techniques from recursive Bayesian estimation to incorporate spatio-temporal prior knowledge into the image reconstruction procedure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in the real-time three-dimensional imaging of a tissue mimicking phantom of dimensions comparable to that of the infant head, using the MONSTIR II instrument developed at University College London.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffuse optical tomography", "Real-time dynamics", "Reconstruction procedure", "Recursive Bayesian estimation", "Temporal resolution", "Three dimensional imaging", "Tissue mimicking phantom", "University College London"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016738820", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"7201575253": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "7201575253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56303480500": {"Name": "Dempsey L.", "AuthorID": "56303480500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55793189898": {"Name": "Cooper R.", "AuthorID": "55793189898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7202353675": {"Name": "Gibson A.", "AuthorID": "7202353675", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004407749": {"Name": "Hebden J.", "AuthorID": "7004407749", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
