It can be used in big spatial data (e.g., remote sensing data) organization and presentation while achieving the online sharing by hash-based P2P networks. In the P2P network, a map, which contains the real geographic space users and the virtual scene user avatar with prep the virtual network nodes, has been made. Moreover, it can also support the following integrated functions of VRGIS: 3-D spatial analysis function, 3-D visualization for spatial information process, and Web engine for 3-D globe and smart big city. To evaluate WebVRGIS system, a user study had been conducted by comparing it with virtual community system. The performance evaluation results had confirmed the higher usability and user satisfaction of the proposed WebVRGIS system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3-D globe", "Big data", "HCI", "peer-To-peer (P2P) network", "three-dimensional (3-D) visualization", "virtual geographical environment", "WebVRGIS"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D globe", "Peer to Peer (P2P) network", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "Virtual geographical environments", "WebVRGIS"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010073638", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55925162500": {"Name": "Lv Z.", "AuthorID": "55925162500", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology (SIAT), Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "56540819200": {"Name": "Yin T.", "AuthorID": "56540819200", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Communications Research Group, School of Engineering and Informatics, University of Sussex"}, "57216166638": {"Name": "Zhang X.", "AuthorID": "57216166638", "AffiliationID": "60022422", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Research Center of Marine Information Technology, College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China"}, "36678677800": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "36678677800", "AffiliationID": "60022422", "AffiliationName": "Engineering Research Center of Marine Information Technology, College of Information Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China"}, "57199094588": {"Name": "Song H.", "AuthorID": "57199094588", "AffiliationID": "60021143", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, West Virginia University"}}}
