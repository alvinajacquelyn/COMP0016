All rights reserved.This chapter raises the question of the basis of global health duty to wealthy and developed nations-that they should make a concerted effort to provide medical care for developing nations. There are two approaches that can be used to address the global health duty: language and human rights. Language can determine how a problem is framed and offer a variety of solutions to that effect. The human rights angle is based on judiciary concerns, although there has yet to be a specific mandate for that right.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Developed nations", "Developing nations", "Global health duty", "Human rights", "Language"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938510355", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"12800099800": {"Name": "Wolff J.", "AuthorID": "12800099800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
