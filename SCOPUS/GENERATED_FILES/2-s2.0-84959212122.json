Bifurcation analysis of the pairwise ODE approximation and the network-based stochastic simulation is carried out, showing that three typical behaviours may occur; namely, oscillations can be observed besides disease-free or endemic steady states. The oscillatory behaviour in the stochastic simulations is studied using Fourier analysis, as well as through analysing the exact master equations of the stochastic model. By going beyond simply comparing simulation results to mean-field models, our approach yields deeper insights into the observed phenomena and help better understand and map out the limitations of mean-field models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic network", "Oscillation", "Pairwise model", "SIS epidemic"], "IndexKeywords": ["Communicable Diseases", "Computer Simulation", "Epidemics", "Humans", "Mathematical Concepts", "Models, Biological", "Stochastic Processes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959212122", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (miscellaneous)", "AGRI", "1101"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56199184400": {"Name": "Szab\u00f3-Solticzky A.", "AuthorID": "56199184400", "AffiliationID": "60027811", "AffiliationName": "Numerical Analysis and Large Networks Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "7402477033": {"Name": "Simon P.", "AuthorID": "7402477033", "AffiliationID": "60027811", "AffiliationName": "Numerical Analysis and Large Networks Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "55884445900": {"Name": "Berthouze L.", "AuthorID": "55884445900", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics, University of Sussex"}, "35746359000": {"Name": "Kiss I.", "AuthorID": "35746359000", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, University of Sussex"}}}
