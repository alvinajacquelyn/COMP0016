All Rights Reserved.Age-related cognitive changes in the Russian population have not been sufficiently studied. Objective: to assess the time course of changes in cognitive functions (CF) in two serial measurements 9 years apart in the urban population of middle, elder, and senile age and their relationship to education level. Patients and methods: A random male and female sample of 45-69-year-old Novosibirsk residents (n=9360; HAPIEE project) was surveyed. CF was tested by standard methods. Resurvey was conducted in a random subsample (n=1663) included in this analysis. The mean follow-up period was 8.8 years (SD 1.1). Results and discussion: The test for semantic verbal fluency revealed its dynamic decline in all age groups, which was steeper in women than in men (p<0.001). Persons aged 70 years and older showed negative changes in memory, verbal fluency, and attention (p<0.001). Persons with primary (6%) and vocational (26%) education had steeper rates of decline in delayed recall (p=0.011; 0.038) than those with university education (35%). Conclusion: It is established that a dynamic decrease in CF begins at the age of 55-59 years; it is steeper among those aged 70 years and older. An age-related decline in memory function is accelerated in persons with lower educational levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-related changes", "Cognitive decline", "Cognitive functions", "Education level"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062179373", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57207032758": {"Name": "Titarenko A.V.", "AuthorID": "57207032758", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Federal Research Center, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "56221217700": {"Name": "Shishkin S.V.", "AuthorID": "56221217700", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Federal Research Center, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "15030341800": {"Name": "Shcherbakova L.V.", "AuthorID": "15030341800", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Federal Research Center, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "21735150600": {"Name": "Verevkin E.G.", "AuthorID": "21735150600", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Federal Research Center, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "6603876724": {"Name": "Malyutina S.K.", "AuthorID": "6603876724", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Federal Research Center, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "35740512000": {"Name": "Holmes M.", "AuthorID": "35740512000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Old Road Campus"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
