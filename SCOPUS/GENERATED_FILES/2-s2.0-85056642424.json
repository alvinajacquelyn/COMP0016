Conventional DBS is continuously ON even though PD symptoms fluctuate over time leading to undesirable side-effects and high energy requirements. This study investigates the use of a Iogistic regression-based classifier to identify periods when PD patients have rest tremor exploiting Local Field Potentials (LFPs) recorded with DBS electrodes implanted in the Subthalamic Nucleus in 7 PD patients (8 hemispheres). Analyzing 36.1 minutes of data with a 512 milliseconds non-overlapping window, the classification accuracy was well above chance-level for all patients, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) ranging from 0.67 to 0.93. The features with the most discriminative ability were, in descending order, power in the 31-45 Hz, 5-7 Hz, 21-30 Hz, 46-55 Hz, and 56-95 Hz frequency bands. These results suggest that using a machine learning-based classifier, such as the one proposed in this study, can form the basis for on-demand DBS therapy for PD tremor, with the potential to reduce side-effects and lower battery consumption.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Deep Brain Stimulation", "Electrodes", "Humans", "Parkinson Disease", "Subthalamic Nucleus", "Tremor"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056642424", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"56424513100": {"Name": "Shah S.A.", "AuthorID": "56424513100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60114209", "AffiliationName": "MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "36646932100": {"Name": "Tinkhauser G.", "AuthorID": "36646932100", "AffiliationID": "60010987", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Bern"}, "57214061716": {"Name": "Brown P.", "AuthorID": "57214061716", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60114209", "AffiliationName": "MRC Brain Network Dynamics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "57145063500": {"Name": "Chen C.C.", "AuthorID": "57145063500", "AffiliationID": "60031913", "AffiliationName": "Division of Movement Disorders, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital"}, "55209995700": {"Name": "Little S.", "AuthorID": "55209995700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}}}
