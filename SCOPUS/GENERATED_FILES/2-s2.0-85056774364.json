All rights reserved.The U.S. Clean Power Plan stipulates a state-specific performance-based CO2 emission standard, delegating states with considerable flexibility for using either a tradable performance-based or a mass-based permit program. This paper analyzes these two standards under imperfect competitive. We limit our attention to (1) short-run analyses and (2) a situation in which all states are subject to the same type of standard. We show that while the cross-subsidy inherent in the performance-based standard might effectively reduce power prices, it could also inflate energy consumption. A dominant firm with a relatively clean endowment under the performance-based standard would be able to manipulate the electricity market as well as to elevate permit prices, which might worsen market outcomes compared to its mass-based counterpart. On the other hand, the \u201ccross-subsidy\u201d could be the dominant force leading to a higher social welfare if the leader has a relatively dirty endowment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate policy", "Electricity industry", "Mathematical program with equilibrium constraints", "Performance-based standards"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056774364", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"7601428084": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "7601428084", "AffiliationID": "60024941", "AffiliationName": "Baskin School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz"}, "56126045200": {"Name": "Tanaka M.", "AuthorID": "56126045200", "AffiliationID": "60104344", "AffiliationName": "National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS)"}, "7201954788": {"Name": "Siddiqui A.", "AuthorID": "7201954788", "AffiliationID": "60002970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Decision Sciences"}}}
