The experimental arrangement consists of two orthogonal quantum point contacts (QPCs), one acting as injector and the other as detector of the collimated 1D electrons as a function of transverse magnetic field. The focusing spectrum shows anomalous behaviour, the first and third focusing peaks split into two sub-peaks while second peak remains as a single peak. The observed splitting, a signature of spin states, arises from the spin-orbit interaction when the 1D electrons are injected into the 2D regime, thus allowing us to manipulate the spin states within the 1D channel.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Direct observations", "Electron focusing", "Experimental arrangement", "GaAs/AlGaAs", "Quantum point contact", "Spin orbit interactions", "Transverse magnetic field", "Two dimensional electrons"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043793847", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193274229": {"Name": "Yan C.", "AuthorID": "57193274229", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57202530291": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "57202530291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56463590500": {"Name": "Pepper M.", "AuthorID": "56463590500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7402627858": {"Name": "Thomas K.", "AuthorID": "7402627858", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701461985": {"Name": "See P.", "AuthorID": "6701461985", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "8546355000": {"Name": "Farrer I.", "AuthorID": "8546355000", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "36050490200": {"Name": "Ritchie D.", "AuthorID": "36050490200", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "57203312733": {"Name": "Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "57203312733", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "57056797900": {"Name": "Jones G.", "AuthorID": "57056797900", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}}}
