Here, they present a large case series of well-differentiated bronchial NETs with the aim of investigating the behavior of these tumors and long-term outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review was performed of 105 patients with bronchial NETs managed in a tertiary referral center in the period between January 1998 and January 2012. Results: Bronchial NETs are commoner in females and the commonest presenting symptoms were cough (13.9%) and dyspnoea (11.6%). OctreoscanTM and Gallium-68 DOTATATE PET were found to have similar diagnostic sensitivity and FDG PET was more sensitive for higher-grade tumors. Over a median follow-up period of 35.5 months mortality rate was 5.7%. The 5-year survival was 76% and the 10-year survival was 62%. Female patients survived longer but this difference was not statistically significant (P =.59). Older age greater than 50 years (P =.027), higher levels of Chromogranin A (CgA) (P =.034), first-line treatment with surgery (P =.005), ki67 over 10% (P =.037), and tumor stage (P =.036) but not tumor grade (P =.22), were significantly associated with survival. Discussion: Several factors have been identified which are independently associated with survival including CgA levels greater than 100 pmol/L, tumor stage, age greater than 50, ki67 over 10% and having surgery as first-line treatment. There was no difference in survival between typical and atypical carcinoids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["chemotherapy", "lung cancer", "thoracic surgery", "treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Bronchial Neoplasms", "Carcinoid Tumor", "Chromogranin A", "Female", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Ki-67 Antigen", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality", "Neoplasm Staging", "Neuroendocrine Tumors", "Outcome Assessment (Health Care)", "Positron-Emission Tomography", "Retrospective Studies", "Survival Rate", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009809614", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"38862641900": {"Name": "Pericleous M.", "AuthorID": "38862641900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, European (ENETS) Centre of Excellence, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6507640702": {"Name": "Karpathakis A.", "AuthorID": "6507640702", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "16033469000": {"Name": "Toumpanakis C.", "AuthorID": "16033469000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, European (ENETS) Centre of Excellence, Royal Free Hospital"}, "36716457100": {"Name": "Lumgair H.", "AuthorID": "36716457100", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, European (ENETS) Centre of Excellence, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57192978042": {"Name": "Reiner J.", "AuthorID": "57192978042", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, European (ENETS) Centre of Excellence, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603079245": {"Name": "Thirlwell C.", "AuthorID": "6603079245", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Cancer Institute"}, "55908628800": {"Name": "Caplin M.E.", "AuthorID": "55908628800", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Neuroendocrine Tumour Unit, European (ENETS) Centre of Excellence, Royal Free Hospital"}, "13204359500": {"Name": "Marelli L.", "AuthorID": "13204359500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Gastroenterology, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
