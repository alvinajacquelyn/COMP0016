As a consequence of the 4%-lattice-mismatch, threading dislocations (TDs) nucleate at the interface between the Si substrate and III-V epilayers and propagate to the active regions of the cell. There they act as recombination centers and degrade the performances of the cell. In our case, direct AlAs/GaAs superlattice growth coupled with InAlAs/AlAs strained layer superlattice (SLS) dislocation filter layers (DFLSs) have been used to reduce the TD density from 1\u00d7109cm-2 to 1(\u00b10.2)\u00d7107cm-2. Lattice-matched Al0.2Ga0.8As cells have also been grown on GaAs as a reference. The best cell grown on silicon exhibits a Voc of 964mV, compared with a Voc of 1128mV on GaAs. Fill factors of respectively 77.6% and 80.2% have been calculated. Due to the lack of an anti-reflection coating and the non-optimized architecture of the devices, relatively low Jsc have been measured: 7.30mA.cm-2 on Si and 6.74mA.cm-2 on GaAs. The difference in short-circuit currents is believed to be caused by a difference of thickness between the samples due to discrepancies in the calibration of the MBE prior to each growth. The bandgap-voltage offset of the cells, defined as Eg/q-Voc, is relatively high on both substrates with 736mV measured on Si versus 572mV on GaAs. The non-negligible TD density partly explains this result on Si. On GaAs, non-ideal growth conditions are possibly responsible for these suboptimal performances.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AlGaAs solar cell", "Dislocation filter", "III-V on silicon", "MBE", "Superlattice", "Threading dislocation density"], "IndexKeywords": ["Optimized architectures", "Photovoltaic solar cells", "Recombination centers", "Solid-source molecular beam epitaxy", "Strained layer superlattice", "Sub-optimal performance", "Threading dislocation", "Threading dislocation densities"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982091472", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56897168100": {"Name": "Onno A.", "AuthorID": "56897168100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36573632900": {"Name": "Jiang Q.", "AuthorID": "36573632900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "54939079100": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "54939079100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55365959800": {"Name": "Tang M.", "AuthorID": "55365959800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57188814671": {"Name": "Maidaniuk Y.", "AuthorID": "57188814671", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "57217704550": {"Name": "Benamara M.", "AuthorID": "57217704550", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "7005644077": {"Name": "Mazur Y.I.", "AuthorID": "7005644077", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "7004309232": {"Name": "Salamo G.J.", "AuthorID": "7004309232", "AffiliationID": "60004862", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Nanoscience and Engineering, University of Arkansas"}, "6603692302": {"Name": "Harder N.P.", "AuthorID": "6603692302", "AffiliationID": "60014309", "AffiliationName": "TOTAL Marketing Services, New Energies Division"}, "6601973104": {"Name": "Oberbeck L.", "AuthorID": "6601973104", "AffiliationID": "60014309", "AffiliationName": "TOTAL Marketing Services, New Energies Division"}}}
