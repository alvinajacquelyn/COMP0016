Due to no published level I data, we summarize the current International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of OSD. Methods: Guidelines were formulated based on analysis of pertinent literature and consensus among authors. This document was vetted by the multidisciplinary members of the ICCS via its website before submission for peer review publication. Results: The more frequent diagnosis of OSD is associated with increased operative intervention. Spinal cord untethering (SCU) has a highly variable risk profile, largely dependent on the specific form of OSD. Progressive neurological deterioration attributed to \u201ctethered cord\u201d may occur, with or without surgery, in selected forms of OSD whereas other cohorts do well. Conclusion: Infants with classic cutaneous markers of OSD, with progressive neurologic, skeletal, and/or urologic findings, present no diagnostic or therapeutic dilemma: they routinely undergo MRI and SCU. Conversely, in asymptomatic patients or those with fixed, minor abnormalities, the risk profile of these OSD cohorts should be carefully considered before SCU is performed. Irrespective of whether or not SCU is performed, patients at risk for progression should be followed carefully throughout childhood and adolescence by a multidisciplinary team.", "AuthorKeywords": ["incontinence", "neuro-orthopaedic syndrome", "spinal dysraphism", "tethered cord syndrome", "tethered spinal cord"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Consensus", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Tube Defects", "Spinal Cord", "Spinal Dysraphism"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045237417", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"6603846366": {"Name": "Tuite G.F.", "AuthorID": "6603846366", "AffiliationID": "60002507", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Brain Protection Science, Division of Pediatric Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital"}, "57216295405": {"Name": "Thompson D.N.P.", "AuthorID": "57216295405", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56433759500": {"Name": "Austin P.F.", "AuthorID": "56433759500", "AffiliationID": "60002441, 60008978", "AffiliationName": "Department Surgery, Division of Urology, Texas Children's Hospital & Scott Department of Urology, Baylor College of Medicine"}, "13310371800": {"Name": "Bauer S.B.", "AuthorID": "13310371800", "AffiliationID": "60030521", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Boston Children's Hospital"}}}
