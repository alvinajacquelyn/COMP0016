In the literature, the average is usually taken to be \u03b1 with a very strong error term, leading to an asymptotic formula for the partial sums with a very strong error term. In practice, the average at the prime values may only be known with a fairly weak error term, and so we explore here how good an estimate this will imply for the partial sums of f, developing new techniques to do so.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Averages of multiplicative functions", "Landau\u2013Selberg\u2013Delange method", "Wirsing\u2019s theorem"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064275258", "SubjectAreas": [["Algebra and Number Theory", "MATH", "2602"]], "AuthorData": {"7004522820": {"Name": "Granville A.", "AuthorID": "7004522820", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35799808400": {"Name": "Koukoulopoulos D.", "AuthorID": "35799808400", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de math\u00e9matiques et de statistique, Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"}}}
