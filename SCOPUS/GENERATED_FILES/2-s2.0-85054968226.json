This continually expanding array of bnAbs has crucially led to the identification of novel epitopes on the HIV envelope protein via which antibodies can block a broad range of HIV strains. Moreover, these studies have produced high-resolution understanding of these sites of vulnerability on the envelope protein. They have also clarified the mechanisms of action of bnAbs and provided detailed descriptions of B cell ontogenies from which they arise. However, it is still not possible to predict which HIV-infected individuals will go onto develop breath nor is it possible to induce neutralization breadth by immunization in humans. This review aims to discuss the major insights gained so far and also to evaluate the requirement to continue isolating and characterizing new bnAbs. While new epitopes may remain to be uncovered, a clearer probable benefit of further bnAb characterization is a greater understanding of key decision points in bnAb development within the anti-HIV immune response. This in turn may lead to new insights into how to trigger bnAbs by immunization and more clearly define the challenges to using bnAbs as therapeutic agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibody", "Epitope", "HIV", "Immunity", "Infection", "Neutralization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Neutralizing", "B-Lymphocytes", "env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "Epitopes", "HIV Antibodies", "HIV Infections", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Mice", "Neutralization Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054968226", "SubjectAreas": [["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"36630795600": {"Name": "McCoy L.", "AuthorID": "36630795600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
