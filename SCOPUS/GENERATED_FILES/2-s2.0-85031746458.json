This is well documented in relation to the activities of the tobacco industry, but research on other industries is less well developed. We therefore analysed public statements and documents from four unhealthy commodity industries to investigate whether and how they used arguments about complexity in this way. Methods We analysed alcohol, food, soda and gambling industry documents and websites and minutes of reports of relevant health select committees, using standard document analysis methods. Results Two main framings were identified: (i) these industries argue that aetiology is complex, so individual products cannot be blamed; and (ii) they argue that population health measures are 'too simple' to address complex public health problems. However, in this second framing, there are inherent contradictions in how industry used 'complexity', as their alternative solutions are generally not, in themselves, complex. Conclusion The concept of complexity, as commonly used in public health, is also widely employed by unhealthy commodity industries to influence how the public and policymakers understand health issues. It is frequently used in response to policy announcements and in response to new scientific evidence (particularly evidence on obesity and alcohol harms). The arguments and language may reflect the existence of a cross-industry 'playbook' , whose use results in the undermining of effective public health policies - in particular the undermining of effective regulation of profitable industry activities that are harmful to the public's health.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Advertising as Topic", "Beverages", "Commerce", "Female", "Food Industry", "Gambling", "Health Policy", "Humans", "Male", "Public Health", "Tobacco Industry", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031746458", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7005745484": {"Name": "Petticrew M.", "AuthorID": "7005745484", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57203036465": {"Name": "Knai C.", "AuthorID": "57203036465", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "57195070465": {"Name": "Hessari N.M.", "AuthorID": "57195070465", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "6508254091": {"Name": "Katikireddi S.V.", "AuthorID": "6508254091", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60005028", "AffiliationName": "MRC/CSO Social and Public Health Sciences Unit, University of Glasgow"}, "24451542400": {"Name": "Weishaar H.", "AuthorID": "24451542400", "AffiliationID": "60102536", "AffiliationName": "Hertie School of Governance"}, "7006128177": {"Name": "Cassidy R.", "AuthorID": "7006128177", "AffiliationID": "60010964", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Goldsmiths University of London"}, "55574208406": {"Name": "Thomas J.", "AuthorID": "55574208406", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPPI-Centre, SSRU, Department of Social Science, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
