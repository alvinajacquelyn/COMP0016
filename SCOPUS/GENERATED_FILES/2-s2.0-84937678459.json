Methods: We ascertained 18 people with active epilepsy identified in a community-based registry of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) with ECG-confirmed VT/VF (cases). We compared them with 470 individuals with VT/VF without epilepsy (VT/VF controls) and 54 individuals with epilepsy without VT/VF (epilepsy controls). Data on comorbidity, epilepsy severity, and medication use were collected and entered into (conditional) logistic regression models to identify determinants of VT/VF in epilepsy. Results: In most cases, there was an obvious (10/18) or presumed cardiovascular cause (5/18) in view of preexisting heart disease. In 2 of the 3 remaining events, near-sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) was established after successful resuscitation. Cases had a higher prevalence of congenital/inherited heart disease (17% vs 1%, p 0.002), and experienced VT/VF at younger age (57 vs 64 years, p 0.023) than VT/VF controls. VT/VF in cases occurred more frequently at/near home (89% vs 58%, p 0.009), and was less frequently witnessed (72% vs 89%, p 0.048) than in VT/VF controls. Cases more frequently had clinically relevant heart disease (50% vs 15%, p 0.005) and intellectual disability (28% vs 1%, p < 0.001) than epilepsy controls. Conclusion: Cardiovascular disease rather than epilepsy characteristics is the main determinant of VT/VF in people with epilepsy in the community. SCA and SUDEP are partially overlapping disease entities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Case-Control Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Death, Sudden, Cardiac", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prospective Studies", "Registries", "Residence Characteristics", "Risk Factors", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937678459", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"47761281500": {"Name": "Lamberts R.J.", "AuthorID": "47761281500", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "36444461600": {"Name": "Wassenaar M.", "AuthorID": "36444461600", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "7005366920": {"Name": "De Haan G.J.", "AuthorID": "7005366920", "AffiliationID": "60027759", "AffiliationName": "Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland (SEIN)"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "Epilepsy Society"}, "8906436400": {"Name": "Thijs R.D.", "AuthorID": "8906436400", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "LUMC Leiden University Medical Center"}, "23974507600": {"Name": "Blom M.T.", "AuthorID": "23974507600", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center"}, "6508379242": {"Name": "Bardai A.", "AuthorID": "6508379242", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center"}, "7403011098": {"Name": "Tan H.L.", "AuthorID": "7403011098", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Center"}, "6701575110": {"Name": "Leijten F.S.", "AuthorID": "6701575110", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "University Medical Center Utrecht"}}}
