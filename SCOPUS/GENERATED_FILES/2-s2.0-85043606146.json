Design: Multicenter retrospective interventional case series. Methods: Consecutive cases of bleb-related infection following ab interno gel implant surgery from 2 university-affiliated hospitals were included. Risk factors, visual outcomes, intraocular pressure, and subsequent management were analyzed. Results: We report 3 cases of late bleb-related infection occurring after ab interno gelatin stent insertion (8, 7, and 24 months after surgery). One case had blebitis only; the other 2 had bleb-related endophthalmitis. All cases responded rapidly to management of their infections according to standard bleb-related infection protocol, recovering to within 2 lines of their previous visual acuity (6/9, 6/12, and 6/18). Explantation of the devices was not required. Conclusions: Bleb-related infections after ab interno gel implant insertion can occur. If infection is treated appropriately, good clinical outcomes are possible.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alkylating Agents", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Endophthalmitis", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gelatin", "Glaucoma", "Glaucoma Drainage Implants", "Humans", "Intraocular Pressure", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitomycin", "Moraxellaceae Infections", "Prosthesis-Related Infections", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Staphylococcal Infections", "Tonometry, Ocular", "Trabecular Meshwork", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043606146", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"15042638800": {"Name": "Kerr N.M.", "AuthorID": "15042638800", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57193136897": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57193136897", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "57183794000": {"Name": "Sandhu A.", "AuthorID": "57183794000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7007041047": {"Name": "Barton K.", "AuthorID": "7007041047", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6603224852": {"Name": "Harasymowycz P.J.", "AuthorID": "6603224852", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Montreal"}}}
