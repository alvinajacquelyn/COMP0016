The use of the TV regularisation technique helps to preserve discontinuities in reconstruction, such as the boundaries of perturbations and sharp changes in conductivity, which are unintentionally smoothed by traditional l<inf>2</inf> norm regularisation. However, the non-differentiability of TV regularisation has led to the use of different algorithms. Recent advances in TV algorithms such as the primal dual interior point method (PDIPM), the linearised alternating direction method of multipliers (LADMM) and the spilt Bregman (SB) method have all been demonstrated successful EIT applications, but no direct comparison of the techniques has been made. Their noise performance, spatial resolution and convergence rate applied to time difference EIT were studied in simulations on 2D cylindrical meshes with different noise levels, 2D cylindrical tank and 3D anatomically head-shaped phantoms containing vegetable material with complex conductivity. LADMM had the fastest calculation speed but worst resolution due to the exclusion of the second-derivative; PDIPM reconstructed the sharpest change in conductivity but with lower contrast than SB; SB had a faster convergence rate than PDIPM and the lowest image errors.", "AuthorKeywords": ["electrical impedance tomography", "regularisation", "total variation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Electric Impedance", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Time Factors", "Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930635001", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55728233100": {"Name": "Zhou Z.", "AuthorID": "55728233100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55444497200": {"Name": "Sun Z.", "AuthorID": "55444497200", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56158587900": {"Name": "Xu H.", "AuthorID": "56158587900", "AffiliationID": "60024350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic Science and Technology, National University of Defense Technology"}, "56037206400": {"Name": "Dos Santos G.", "AuthorID": "56037206400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "24802061500": {"Name": "Dowrick T.", "AuthorID": "24802061500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "56673693400": {"Name": "Avery J.", "AuthorID": "56673693400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205935474": {"Name": "Holder D.", "AuthorID": "57205935474", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
