Here, we present a combined experimental and computational investigation into the ionic conductivity of Li6Y(BO3)3, a new class of solid electrolytes with a pseudo-layered structure. Temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy shows the pristine material exhibits an ionic conductivity of 2.2 \u00d7 10-3 S cm-1 around 400 \u00b0C, despite the fact that density functional theory calculations point to multiple remarkably low-energy diffusion pathways. Our calculations indicate small energy barriers for lithium interstitials to diffuse along one-dimensional channels oriented in the c-direction, and also for lithium vacancies diffusing within ac planes. This coexistence of diffusion mechanisms indicates that Li6Y(BO3)3 is an extremely versatile host for exploring and understanding mechanisms for lithium-ion conductivity. We also find no evidence for reactivity with moisture in the atmosphere and that the material appears electrochemically stable when in direct contact with metallic lithium. This robust stability, alongside ionic conductivity that can be manipulated through appropriate aliovalent substitution, make Li6Y(BO3)3 an exceptionally promising new class of solid electrolyte.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aliovalent substitution", "Computational investigation", "Diffusion mechanisms", "Impedance spectroscopy", "Lithium-ion conductivity", "One-dimensional channels", "Pristine materials", "Temperature dependent"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967104278", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57219283315": {"Name": "Lopez-Bermudez B.", "AuthorID": "57219283315", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "26636229700": {"Name": "Zeier W.G.", "AuthorID": "26636229700", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "55907574600": {"Name": "Zhou S.", "AuthorID": "55907574600", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "13408899600": {"Name": "Melot B.C.", "AuthorID": "13408899600", "AffiliationID": "60029311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Southern California"}, "35769483000": {"Name": "Lehner A.J.", "AuthorID": "35769483000", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Laboratory, University of California"}, "8529668300": {"Name": "Hu J.", "AuthorID": "8529668300", "AffiliationID": "60029241", "AffiliationName": "Materials Research Laboratory, University of California"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.O.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "55174608300": {"Name": "Morgan B.J.", "AuthorID": "55174608300", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}}}
