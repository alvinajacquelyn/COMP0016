OH cell control is thus of considerable interest. OH cells are activated by fasting [11, 12] and proposed to stimulate eating [13]. However, OH cells are also activated by diverse feeding-unrelated stressors [14\u201317] and stimulate locomotion and \u201cfight-or-flight\u201d responses [18\u201320]. Such OH-mediated behaviors presumably preclude concurrent eating, and loss of OH cells produces obesity, suggesting that OH cells facilitate net energy expenditure rather than energy intake [2, 21\u201323]. The relationship between OH cells and eating, therefore, remains unclear. Here we investigated this issue at the level of natural physiological activity of OH cells. First, we monitored eating-associated dynamics of OH cells using fiber photometry in free-feeding mice. OH cell activity decreased within milliseconds after eating onset, and remained in a down state during eating. This OH inactivation occurred with foods of diverse tastes and textures, as well as with calorie-free \u201cfood,\u201d in both fed and fasted mice, suggesting that it is driven by the act of eating itself. Second, we probed the implications of natural OH cell signals for eating and weight in a new conditional OH cell-knockout model. Complete OH cell inactivation in adult brain induced a hitherto unrecognized overeating phenotype and caused overweight that was preventable by mild dieting. These results support an inhibitory interplay between OH signals and eating, and demonstrate that OH cell activity is rapidly controllable, across nutritional states, by voluntary action.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Eating", "Energy Intake", "Energy Metabolism", "Feeding Behavior", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons", "Obesity", "Orexins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992091948", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55450675100": {"Name": "Gonz\u00e1lez J.A.", "AuthorID": "55450675100", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "7801589913": {"Name": "Iordanidou P.", "AuthorID": "7801589913", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Mill Hill Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "8599399900": {"Name": "Burdakov D.", "AuthorID": "8599399900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry Psychology and Neuroscience, Department of Developmental Neurobiology, King's College London"}, "7403326622": {"Name": "Jensen L.T.", "AuthorID": "7403326622", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University"}, "7006163839": {"Name": "Fugger L.", "AuthorID": "7006163839", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851, 60001633", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Neuroinflammation, Division of Clinical Neurology and MRC Human Immunology Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "57196567675": {"Name": "Strom M.", "AuthorID": "57196567675", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, University College London"}}}
