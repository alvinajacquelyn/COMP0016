Existing research on BIM diffusion focuses on the industry, company, and project levels while disregarding the impact of perceptions at the individual level. This research aims to extend the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology (UTAUT) model to understand the perceptions that individuals have towards working with BIM. A survey was completed by 84 industry stakeholders and the results analysed against a modified UTAUT model that adds the variable of Attitude and employs moderators of Experience and Voluntariness. The results reveal that Performance Expectancy does not directly affect Behavioural Intention, signifying that BIM is perceived as an unrewarded addition to existing work processes. These findings evince the need to redefine strategies, policies, and incentive schemes in order to advance the acceptance of BIM in the U.K. and worldwide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Building information modelling (BIM)", "Construction", "Diffusion of innovations", "Technology adoption", "Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Behavioural intentions", "Building Information Modelling", "Diffusion of innovations", "Individual levels", "Industry stakeholders", "Technology adoption", "The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology(UTAUT)", "Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995743299", "SubjectAreas": [["Business and International Management", "BUSI", "1403"], ["Management of Technology and Innovation", "BUSI", "1405"]], "AuthorData": {"8709005200": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "8709005200", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "57191993770": {"Name": "Restrepo L.", "AuthorID": "57191993770", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}, "7407042094": {"Name": "Chang C.Y.", "AuthorID": "7407042094", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London"}}}
