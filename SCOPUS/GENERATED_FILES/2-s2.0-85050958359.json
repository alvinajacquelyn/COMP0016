After distinguishing comprehension (identifying the intended import of a communicative act) from interpretation (going beyond the intended import to draw one\u2019s own conclusions), it discusses a range of stylistic and rhetorical effects-typically created by departures from expected syntax, lexis, or prosody-which provide tentative cues to ostension and therefore create greater expectations of relevance. It ends by considering how relevance theory might deal with the \u0149on-propositional effects\u2019 associated with images, emotions, and sensorimotor processes while remaining within the bounds of a properly inferential theory.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comprehension", "Import", "Inference", "Interpretation", "Non-propositional effects", "Ostension", "Rhetoric", "Stylistic effects"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050958359", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"14066846800": {"Name": "Wilson D.", "AuthorID": "14066846800", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Study of Mind in Nature, University of Oslo"}}}
