Published by Elsevier B.V. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.Selecting the ideal operating point for a fuel cell depends on the application and consequent trade-off between efficiency, power density and various operating considerations. A systematic methodology for determining the optimal operating point for fuel cells is lacking; there is also the need for a single-value metric to describe and compare fuel cell performance. This work shows how the 'current of lowest resistance' can be accurately measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and used as a useful metric of fuel cell performance. This, along with other measures, is then used to generate an 'electro-thermal performance map' of fuel cell operation. A commercial air-cooled open-cathode fuel cell is used to demonstrate how the approach can be used; in this case leading to the identification of the optimum operating temperature of \u223c45 \u00b0C.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Air-cooled open-cathode polymer electrolyte fuel cell", "Current of lowest resistance", "Electro-thermal performance mapping", "Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy", "Forced convection", "Optimum operating temperature"], "IndexKeywords": ["Fuel cell operation", "Fuel cell performance", "Operating points", "Operating temperature", "Optimal operating point", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cells", "Systematic methodology", "Thermal Performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929414788", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57202240331": {"Name": "Meyer Q.", "AuthorID": "57202240331", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "8424177200": {"Name": "Ronaszegi K.", "AuthorID": "8424177200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "56646463900": {"Name": "Pei-June G.", "AuthorID": "56646463900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL"}, "36902842100": {"Name": "Curnick O.", "AuthorID": "36902842100", "AffiliationID": "60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}, "24365904000": {"Name": "Ashton S.", "AuthorID": "24365904000", "AffiliationID": "60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}, "55945068500": {"Name": "Reisch T.", "AuthorID": "55945068500", "AffiliationID": "60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}, "23388612100": {"Name": "Adcock P.", "AuthorID": "23388612100", "AffiliationID": "60170287", "AffiliationName": "Intelligent Energy, Charnwood Building"}}}
