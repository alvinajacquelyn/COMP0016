Patients and methods: We recruited 28 NMO, 22 MS, and 20 healthy controls (HC), who underwent both spinal cord and brain MRI at baseline. Twenty-five NMO and 20 MS completed 1-year follow-up. Baseline spinal cord and brain lesion loads, mean upper cervical cord area (MUCCA), brain, and thalamus volume and their changes during a 1-year follow-up were measured and compared between groups. All the measurements were also compared between progressive and non-progressive groups in NMO and MS. Results: MUCCA decreased significantly during the 1-year follow-up in NMO not in MS. Percentage brain volume changes (PBVC) and thalamus volume changes in MS were significantly higher than NMO. MUCCA changes were significantly different between progressive and non-progressive groups in NMO, while baseline brain lesion volume and PBVC were associated with disability progression in MS. MUCCA changes during 1-year follow-up showed association with clinical disability in NMO. Conclusion: Spinal cord atrophy changes were associated with disability progression in NMO, while baseline brain lesion load and whole brain atrophy changes were related to disability progression in MS. Key Points: \u2022 Spinal cord atrophy progression was observed in NMO. \u2022 Spinal cord atrophy changes were associated with disability progression in NMO. \u2022 Brain lesion and atrophy were related to disability progression in MS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain", "Mean upper cervical cord area", "MRI", "Multiple sclerosis", "Neuromyelitis optica"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Brain", "Disability Evaluation", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Neuromyelitis Optica", "Spinal Cord", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021746999", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"23668203500": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "23668203500", "AffiliationID": "60011715", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital"}, "13610637600": {"Name": "Duan Y.", "AuthorID": "13610637600", "AffiliationID": "60080985, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "54583635100": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "54583635100", "AffiliationID": "60080985, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "55194622400": {"Name": "Ren Z.", "AuthorID": "55194622400", "AffiliationID": "60080985, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "36066893600": {"Name": "Li K.", "AuthorID": "36066893600", "AffiliationID": "112852298", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Key Lab of MRI and Brain Informatics"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}, "7202739770": {"Name": "Shi F.", "AuthorID": "7202739770", "AffiliationID": "60011715", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital"}, "52463965100": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "52463965100", "AffiliationID": "60080985, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "7402334864": {"Name": "Dong H.", "AuthorID": "7402334864", "AffiliationID": "60080985, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "24336661200": {"Name": "Weiler F.", "AuthorID": "24336661200", "AffiliationID": "60107767", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer MEVIS, Institute for Medical Image Computing"}, "7402381436": {"Name": "Hahn H.", "AuthorID": "7402381436", "AffiliationID": "60107767", "AffiliationName": "Fraunhofer MEVIS, Institute for Medical Image Computing"}, "57201788612": {"Name": "Butzkueven H.", "AuthorID": "57201788612", "AffiliationID": "60026553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne"}}}
