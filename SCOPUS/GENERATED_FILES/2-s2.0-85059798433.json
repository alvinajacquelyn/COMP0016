Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.This article provides an update of the latest data and developments within the CATH protein structure classification database (http://www.cathdb.info). The resource provides two levels of release: CATH-B, a daily snapshot of the latest structural domain boundaries and superfamily assignments, and CATH+, which adds layers of derived data, such as predicted sequence domains, functional annotations and functional clustering (known as Functional Families or FunFams). The most recent CATH+ release (version 4.2) provides a huge update in the coverage of structural data. This release increases the number of fully-classified domains by over 40% (from 308 999 to 434 857 structural domains), corresponding to an almost two-fold increase in sequence data (from 53 million to over 95 million predicted domains) organised into 6119 superfamilies. The coverage of high-resolution, protein PDB chains that contain at least one assigned CATH domain is now 90.2% (increased from 82.3% in the previous release). A number of highly requested features have also been implemented in our web pages: Allowing the user to view an alignment between their query sequence and a representative FunFam structure and providing tools that make it easier to view the full structural context (multi-domain architecture) of domains and chains.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amino Acid Sequence", "Animals", "Conserved Sequence", "Databases, Protein", "Gene Ontology", "Genome", "Humans", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Sequence Annotation", "Multigene Family", "Protein Conformation", "Protein Domains", "Sequence Alignment", "Sequence Homology, Amino Acid", "Structure-Activity Relationship"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059798433", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"36913138800": {"Name": "Sillitoe I.", "AuthorID": "36913138800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "55638031200": {"Name": "Dawson N.", "AuthorID": "55638031200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "12788883500": {"Name": "Lewis T.E.", "AuthorID": "12788883500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "55991242500": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55991242500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "9636068500": {"Name": "Lees J.G.", "AuthorID": "9636068500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "57189008598": {"Name": "Ashford P.", "AuthorID": "57189008598", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "57205370973": {"Name": "Tolulope A.", "AuthorID": "57205370973", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "57193591865": {"Name": "Scholes H.M.", "AuthorID": "57193591865", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "56001110900": {"Name": "Senatorov I.", "AuthorID": "56001110900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "57205372832": {"Name": "Bujan A.", "AuthorID": "57205372832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "57205368711": {"Name": "Ceballos Rodriguez-Conde F.", "AuthorID": "57205368711", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "57205374771": {"Name": "Dowling B.", "AuthorID": "57205374771", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "7006781333": {"Name": "Orengo C.A.", "AuthorID": "7006781333", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "7402781853": {"Name": "Thornton J.", "AuthorID": "7402781853", "AffiliationID": "60022106, 60026124", "AffiliationName": "European Bioinformatics Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus"}}}
