In a large, nationally representative sample in the UK (The National Child Development Study), data were collected at birth, in childhood (age 11), and adulthood (ages 33, 42, and 50) to examine the effects of family social background, childhood intelligence, educational and occupation attainment on the personality trait Agreeableness assessed at age 50. Results showed that parental social status, childhood intelligence, education, occupation, and gender were all significantly associated with trait Agreeableness. Structural equation modelling showed that childhood intelligence, education, occupation, and gender had the direct effects on trait Agreeableness, whilst family social status affected adult trait Agreeableness mainly through education and occupation. Gender was the strongest predictor of trait Agreeableness. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agreeableness", "Childhood intelligence", "Education", "Gender", "Longitudinal", "Occupation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84907965341", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Business School (BI)"}, "55326183500": {"Name": "Cheng H.", "AuthorID": "55326183500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
