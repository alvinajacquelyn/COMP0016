Urol.", "Volume": "38", "Issue": 2, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 463, "PageEnd": 472, "CitedBy": 3, "DOI": "10.1007/s00345-019-02783-x", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065721198&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2019, The Author(s).Purpose: Despite superiority of tamsulosin\u2013dutasteride combination therapy versus monotherapy for lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH), patients at risk of disease progression are often initiated on \u03b1-blockers. This study evaluated the impact of initiating tamsulosin monotherapy prior to switching to tamsulosin\u2013dutasteride combination therapy versus immediate combination therapy using a longitudinal model describing International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) trajectories in moderate/severe LUTS/BPH patients at risk of disease progression. Methods: Clinical trial simulations (CTS) were performed using data from 10,238 patients from Phase III/IV dutasteride trials. The effect of varying disease progression rates was explored by comparing profiles on- and off-treatment. CTS scenarios were investigated, including a reference (immediate combination therapy) and six alternative virtual treatment arms (delayed combination therapy of 1\u201324 months). Clinical response (\u2265 25% IPSS reduction relative to baseline) was analysed using log-rank test. Differences in IPSS relative to baseline at various on-treatment time points were assessed by t tests. Results: Delayed combination therapy initiation led to significant (p < 0.01) decreases in clinical response. At month 48, clinical response rate was 79.7% versus 74.1%, 70.3% and 71.0% and IPSS was 6.3 versus 7.6, 8.1 and 8.0 (switchers from tamsulosin monotherapy after 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively) with immediate combination therapy. More patients transitioned from severe/moderate to mild severity scores by month 48. Conclusions: CTS allows systematic evaluation of immediate versus delayed combination therapy. Immediate response to \u03b1-blockers is not predictive of long-term symptom improvement. Observed IPSS differences between immediate and delayed combination therapy (6\u201324 months) are statistically significant.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Benign prostatic hyperplasia", "Clinical trial simulation", "Drug\u2013disease modelling", "Dutasteride", "Lower urinary tract symptoms", "Tamsulosin"], "IndexKeywords": ["5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors", "Aged", "Azasteroids", "Disease Progression", "Double-Blind Method", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Dutasteride", "Humans", "Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prostatic Hyperplasia", "Time-to-Treatment", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065721198", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57208752779": {"Name": "D\u2019Agate S.", "AuthorID": "57208752779", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics Group, University College London"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology Modelling and Simulation, GSK"}, "57213165995": {"Name": "Wilson T.", "AuthorID": "57213165995", "AffiliationID": "60095340", "AffiliationName": "PAREXEL International"}, "6504352311": {"Name": "Adalig B.", "AuthorID": "6504352311", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "Classic and Established Products, GSK"}, "7003827507": {"Name": "Manyak M.", "AuthorID": "7003827507", "AffiliationID": "60097308", "AffiliationName": "Classic and Established Products, GSK"}, "36977039800": {"Name": "Palacios-Moreno J.M.", "AuthorID": "36977039800", "AffiliationID": "118335384", "AffiliationName": "Classic and Established Products, GSK"}, "57208753702": {"Name": "Chavan C.", "AuthorID": "57208753702", "AffiliationID": "60111469", "AffiliationName": "Classic and Established Products, GSK"}, "6603680371": {"Name": "Oelke M.", "AuthorID": "6603680371", "AffiliationID": "100311634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, St. Antonius Hospital"}, "7004802912": {"Name": "Roehrborn C.", "AuthorID": "7004802912", "AffiliationID": "60026695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center"}}}
