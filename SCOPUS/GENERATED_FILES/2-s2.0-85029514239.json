Unfortunately, ASL suffers from an inherently low signal to noise ratio, necessitating methodological advances in ASL acquisition and processing. Spatial regularisation improves the effective signal to noise ratio, and is a common step in ASL processing. However, the standard spatial regularisation technique requires a manually-specified smoothing kernel of an arbitrary size, and can lead to loss of fine detail. Here, we present a Bayesian model of spatial correlation, which uses anatomical information from structural images to perform principled spatial regularisation, modelling the underlying signal and removing the need to set arbitrary smoothing parameters. Using data from a large cohort (N = 130) of preterm-born adolescents and age-matched controls, we show our method yields significant improvements in test-retest reproducibility, increasing the correlation coefficient by 14% relative to Gaussian smoothing and giving a corresponding improvement in statistical power. This novel technique has the potential to significantly improve single inversion time ASL studies, allowing more reliable detection of perfusion differences with a smaller number of subjects.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029514239", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57020797300": {"Name": "Owen D.", "AuthorID": "57020797300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, University College London"}, "22980645100": {"Name": "Melbourne A.", "AuthorID": "22980645100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, University College London"}, "55890955800": {"Name": "Eaton-Rosen Z.", "AuthorID": "55890955800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, University College London"}, "55485914900": {"Name": "Thomas D.", "AuthorID": "55485914900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, University College London"}, "14020386900": {"Name": "Rohrer J.", "AuthorID": "14020386900", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}}}
