However, most studies on the depressogenic role of stressful life events in parents of young children have focussed on mothers. Methods: Using data from 1138 families with young children in Norway, we investigated gender differences in the effect of stressful life events after a child's birth on the development of parental depressive symptoms in 3 follow-ups at child's ages 3\u20136 years. We also explored if gender differences in disposition (personality) may explain any gender differences in the depressogenic effect of life events. Results: Nesting parents within families, we found a female gender bias for both neuroticism and depressive symptoms but no gender difference in the number of life events reported. Importantly, the number of stressful life events predicted the level and course of depressive symptoms similarly for mothers and fathers. Personality traits did not change the association between stressful life events and depressive symptoms in either mothers or fathers. Limitations: Given the study design, causality cannot be inferred. Conclusions: There was no gender difference in the depressogenic effect of stressful life events in our sample. There was no evidence for a female dispositional sensitivity to the depressogenic effect of stressful life events, either. Stressful life events put both mothers and fathers of young children at risk of depression.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study (BONDS)", "Depressive symptoms", "Personality", "Stressful life events"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Depression", "Fathers", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mothers", "Norway", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041613717", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"7003573629": {"Name": "Flouri E.", "AuthorID": "7003573629", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "56823161700": {"Name": "Narayanan M.K.", "AuthorID": "56823161700", "AffiliationID": "116874172", "AffiliationName": "The Norwegian Center for Child Behavioral Development"}, "6506573279": {"Name": "N\u00e6rde A.", "AuthorID": "6506573279", "AffiliationID": "116874172", "AffiliationName": "The Norwegian Center for Child Behavioral Development"}}}
