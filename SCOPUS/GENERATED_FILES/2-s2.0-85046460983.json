American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Predicting the magnetic field within an Earth-directed coronal mass ejection (CME) well before its arrival at Earth is one of the most important issues in space weather research. In this article, we compare the intrinsic flux rope type, that is, the CME orientation and handedness during eruption, with the in situ flux rope type for 20 CME events that have been uniquely linked from Sun to Earth through heliospheric imaging. Our study shows that the intrinsic flux rope type can be estimated for CMEs originating from different source regions using a combination of indirect proxies. We find that only 20% of the events studied match strictly between the intrinsic and in situ flux rope types. The percentage rises to 55% when intermediate cases (where the orientation at the Sun and/or in situ is close to 45\u00b0) are considered as a match. We also determine the change in the flux rope tilt angle between the Sun and Earth. For the majority of the cases, the rotation is several tens of degrees, while 35% of the events change by more than 90\u00b0. While occasionally the intrinsic flux rope type is a good proxy for the magnetic structure impacting Earth, our study highlights the importance of capturing the CME evolution for space weather forecasting purposes. Moreover, we emphasize that determination of the intrinsic flux rope type is a crucial input for CME forecasting models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["corona", "coronal mass ejections", "flux ropes", "magnetic field", "solar wind"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046460983", "SubjectAreas": [["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"57148431400": {"Name": "Palmerio E.", "AuthorID": "57148431400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Helsinki"}, "25925113400": {"Name": "Kilpua E.K.J.", "AuthorID": "25925113400", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Helsinki"}, "14063669200": {"Name": "M\u00f6stl C.", "AuthorID": "14063669200", "AffiliationID": "60020103, 60003156", "AffiliationName": "Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "6701502065": {"Name": "Bothmer V.", "AuthorID": "6701502065", "AffiliationID": "60031514", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Astrophysics, Georg-August-University of G\u00f6ttingen"}, "57199364027": {"Name": "James A.W.", "AuthorID": "57199364027", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7401917508": {"Name": "Green L.M.", "AuthorID": "7401917508", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "55636321844": {"Name": "Isavnin A.", "AuthorID": "55636321844", "AffiliationID": "60121247, 60025063", "AffiliationName": "Center for Mathematical Plasma Astrophysics, Department of Mathematics, KU Leuven"}, "36046867900": {"Name": "Davies J.A.", "AuthorID": "36046867900", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "STFC-RAL Space, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}, "7403906969": {"Name": "Harrison R.A.", "AuthorID": "7403906969", "AffiliationID": "60023254", "AffiliationName": "STFC-RAL Space, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
