Previous studies have shown that dementia is the leading risk factor for delirium and that delirium is an independent risk factor for subsequent development of dementia. However, a major area of controversy is whether delirium is simply a marker of vulnerability to dementia, whether the effect of delirium is solely related to its precipitating factors, or whether delirium itself can cause permanent neuronal damage and lead to dementia. Ultimately, all of these hypotheses are likely to be true. Emerging evidence from epidemiological, clinicopathological, neuroimaging, biomarker, and experimental studies lends support to a strong relation between delirium and dementia, and to both shared and distinct pathological mechanisms. New preventive and therapeutic approaches that target delirium might offer a sought-after opportunity for early intervention, preservation of cognitive reserve, and prevention of irreversible cognitive decline in ageing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Delirium", "Dementia", "Humans"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937428028", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57211562854": {"Name": "Fong T.G.", "AuthorID": "57211562854", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Aging Brain Center, Institute for Aging Research, Hebrew SeniorLife"}, "7202179255": {"Name": "Inouye S.K.", "AuthorID": "7202179255", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Aging Brain Center, Institute for Aging Research, Hebrew SeniorLife"}, "56702201900": {"Name": "Albuquerque A.", "AuthorID": "56702201900", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Aging Brain Center, Institute for Aging Research, Hebrew SeniorLife"}, "55628525626": {"Name": "Davis D.", "AuthorID": "55628525626", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing, UCL"}, "26656744500": {"Name": "Growdon M.E.", "AuthorID": "26656744500", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}}}
