With the advent of wide-area digital photometric surveys, it is now possible to identify massive stars away from prominent Galactic clusters without bias. In this study we consider 40 candidate OB stars found in the field around the young massive cluster, Westerlund 2, by Mohr-Smith et al.: these are located inside a box of 1.5 \u00d7 1.5 deg2 and are selected on the basis of their extinctions and K magnitudes.We present VLT/X-shooter spectra of two of the hottest O stars, respectively 11 and 22 arcmin from the centre of Westerlund 2. They are confirmed as O4V stars, with stellar masses likely to be in excess of 40 M\u00b7. Their radial velocities relative to the non-binary reference object, MSP 182, in Westerlund 2 are -29.4 \u00b1 1.7 and -14.4 \u00b1 2.2 km s-1, respectively. Using Gaia DR2 proper motions we find that between 8 and 11 early O/WR stars in the studied region (including the two VLT targets, plus WR 20c and WR 20aa) could have been ejected fromWesterlund 2 in the last one million years. This represents an efficiency of massive-star ejection of up to ~ 25 per cent. On sky, the positions of these stars and their proper motions show a near N-S alignment. We discuss the possibility that these results are a consequence of prior sub-cluster merging combining with dynamical ejection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxy: structure", "Open clusters and associations: individual: Westerlund 2", "Stars: early-type", "Surveys"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054709098", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"7103125772": {"Name": "Drew J.E.", "AuthorID": "7103125772", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire"}, "56119325200": {"Name": "Mohr-Smith M.", "AuthorID": "56119325200", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire"}, "38961675200": {"Name": "Mongui\u00f3 M.", "AuthorID": "38961675200", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire"}, "56233102700": {"Name": "Napiwotzki R.", "AuthorID": "56233102700", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire"}, "56459658400": {"Name": "Herrero A.", "AuthorID": "56459658400", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrof\u00edsica, Universidad de La Laguna"}, "8859075500": {"Name": "Wright N.J.", "AuthorID": "8859075500", "AffiliationID": "60030210", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics Group, Keele University"}, "57194524856": {"Name": "Kupfer T.", "AuthorID": "57194524856", "AffiliationID": "60031581", "AffiliationName": "Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology"}}}
