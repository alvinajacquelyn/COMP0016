A commonly used measure for this purpose is the Kullback\u2013Leibler (KL) divergence. We propose a variant of the KL divergence, named decision cognizant Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (DC-KL), to reduce the contribution of the minority classes, which obscure the true degree of classifier incongruence. We investigate the properties of the novel divergence measure analytically and by simulation studies. The proposed measure is demonstrated to be more robust to minority class clutter. Its sensitivity to estimation noise is also shown to be considerably lower than that of the classical KL divergence. These properties render the DC-KL divergence a much better statistic for discriminating between classifier congruence and incongruence in pattern recognition systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classifier incongruence", "Divergence clutter", "Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Decision-making systems", "Divergence measures", "KL-divergence", "Multiple classifiers", "Simulation studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988487619", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"6604059264": {"Name": "Ponti M.", "AuthorID": "6604059264", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing\u2014CVSSP, University of Surrey"}, "57191272070": {"Name": "Riva M.", "AuthorID": "57191272070", "AffiliationID": "60008088", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences\u2014ICMC, University of S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "7102315971": {"Name": "Kittler J.", "AuthorID": "7102315971", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing\u2014CVSSP, University of Surrey"}, "57191265663": {"Name": "Campos T.", "AuthorID": "57191265663", "AffiliationID": "60024989", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade Gama\u2014University of Bras\u00edlia/DF"}, "34871084000": {"Name": "Zor C.", "AuthorID": "34871084000", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing\u2014CVSSP, University of Surrey"}}}
