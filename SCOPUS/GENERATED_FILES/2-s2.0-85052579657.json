We aimed to develop and assess the reliability of a novel MRI-based scoring system for reporting the severity of MRI findings in children with suspected JDM. Methods. Nine consultant paediatric radiologists independently assessed and scored 40 axial and 30 coronal thigh MR images of children with suspected JDM on two occasions using the juvenile dermatomyositis magnetic resonance Imaging Score (JIS). JIS was calculated for both reads for each plane and each limb, with possible scores ranging from 0 (normal) to 100 (severe). Inter- and intraobserver agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and two- and one-way random effects models, respectively. Bland-Altman plots of the difference in JIS against the average JIS were also produced for each rater. Results. Overall, the interobserver reliability and agreement was good-for axial images, JIS ranged from 46.8 to 61.0 [ICC = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.82, 0.92)] for the left limb and 47.961.4 [ICC = 0.87 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.92)] for the right limb. For coronal images, JIS ranged from 56.7 to 65.1 [ICC = 0.90 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.95)] for the left limb and 55.7 to 66.8 [ICC = 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.94)] for the right limb. The intraobserver reliability and agreement was good, with ICC ranging from 0.90 to 0.94. Conclusion. JIS is a semi-objective scoring system with potential to serve as a reliable biomarker of disease severity and response to therapeutic interventions in children with JDM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Children", "Creatine kinase", "Electromyogram", "Juvenile dermatomyositis", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "Scoring system"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Clinical Competence", "Dermatomyositis", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Radiologists", "Reproducibility of Results", "ROC Curve", "Severity of Illness Index"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052579657", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"9732420600": {"Name": "Thyoka M.", "AuthorID": "9732420600", "AffiliationID": "60024453", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals"}, "7004749677": {"Name": "Pilkington C.", "AuthorID": "7004749677", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "7103390633": {"Name": "Walters S.", "AuthorID": "7103390633", "AffiliationID": "60176589, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield"}, "6507902996": {"Name": "Arthurs O.J.", "AuthorID": "6507902996", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}, "14054281800": {"Name": "Humphries P.", "AuthorID": "14054281800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, University College London"}, "35561779900": {"Name": "Johnson K.", "AuthorID": "35561779900", "AffiliationID": "60022357", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Birmingham Children's Hospital"}, "37109764600": {"Name": "Kraft J.", "AuthorID": "37109764600", "AffiliationID": "60012508", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "26429589900": {"Name": "Landes C.", "AuthorID": "26429589900", "AffiliationID": "60024857", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005608138": {"Name": "Persaud T.", "AuthorID": "7005608138", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital"}, "57203661386": {"Name": "Sinha R.", "AuthorID": "57203661386", "AffiliationID": "60001239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Newcastle Upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6601982797": {"Name": "Offiah A.C.", "AuthorID": "6601982797", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60029387", "AffiliationName": "University of Sheffield, Academic Unit of Child Health, University of Sheffield, Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Western Bank"}, "57203657683": {"Name": "Adekunle O.", "AuthorID": "57203657683", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
