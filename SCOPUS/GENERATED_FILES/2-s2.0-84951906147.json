Several miRNAs that are expressed during preimplantation embryo development have been shown or are predicted to target genes that regulate cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair in response to DNA damage. Methods: This study compares the expression level of 20 miRNAs and 9 target transcripts involved in DNA repair. The statistical significance of differential miRNA expression between oocytes and blastocysts was determined by t test analysis using the GraphPad Prism v6 software. The possible regulatory roles of miRNAs on their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were analysed using a Pearson correlation test. Results: This study shows for the first time that several miRNAs are expressed in human oocytes and blastocysts that target key genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints. Blastocysts exhibited statistically significant lower expression levels for the majority of miRNAs compared to oocytes (p < 0.05). Correlation analyses showed that there was both inverse and direct association between miRNAs and their target mRNAs. Conclusions: miRNAs target many mRNAs including ones involved in DNA repair mechanisms. This study suggests that miRNAs and their target mRNAs involved in DNA repair are expressed in preimplantation embryos. Similar to the miRNAs expressed in adult tissues, these miRNAs seem to have regulatory roles on their target DNA repair mRNAs during preimplantation embryo development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DNA repair", "Expression", "Human oocyte and blastocyst", "MicroRNA", "Preimplantation embryo development"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Blastocyst", "DNA Repair", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Humans", "MicroRNAs", "Oocytes", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951906147", "SubjectAreas": [["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55450610200": {"Name": "Tulay P.", "AuthorID": "55450610200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for PGD, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "36895827700": {"Name": "Naja R.P.", "AuthorID": "36895827700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for PGD, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "56912323700": {"Name": "Cascales-Roman O.", "AuthorID": "56912323700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for PGD, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "16067597500": {"Name": "SenGupta S.B.", "AuthorID": "16067597500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for PGD, Institute for Women\u2019s Health, University College London"}, "12142583600": {"Name": "Doshi A.", "AuthorID": "12142583600", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "The Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health, University College Hospital, The New Wing Eastman Dental Hospital"}, "6701662902": {"Name": "Serhal P.", "AuthorID": "6701662902", "AffiliationID": "60027403, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "The Centre for Reproductive and Genetic Health, University College Hospital, The New Wing Eastman Dental Hospital"}}}
