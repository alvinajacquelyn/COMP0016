All Rights Reserved.Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality among the elderly. We performed a whole-genome sequencing study of AD in the Chinese population. In addition to the variants identified in or around the APOE locus (sentinel variant rs73052335, P = 1.44 \u00d7 10\u221214), two common variants, GCH1 (rs72713460, P = 4.36 \u00d7 10\u22125) and KCNJ15 (rs928771, P = 3.60 \u00d7 10\u22126), were identified and further verified for their possible risk effects for AD in three small non-Asian AD cohorts. Genotype\u2013phenotype analysis showed that KCNJ15 variant rs928771 affects the onset age of AD, with earlier disease onset in minor allele carriers. In addition, altered expression level of the KCNJ15 transcript can be observed in the blood of AD subjects. Moreover, the risk variants of GCH1 and KCNJ15 are associated with changes in their transcript levels in specific tissues, as well as changes of plasma biomarkers levels in AD subjects. Importantly, network analysis of hippocampus and blood transcriptome datasets suggests that the risk variants in the APOE, GCH1, and KCNJ15 loci might exert their functions through their regulatory effects on immune-related pathways. Taking these data together, we identified common variants of GCH1 and KCNJ15 in the Chinese population that contribute to AD risk. These variants may exert their functional effects through the immune system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer\u2019s disease", "GWAS", "Immune", "Risk variant", "Whole-genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age of Onset", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoproteins E", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "China", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Genotype", "Humans", "Immune System", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042191348", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56843847700": {"Name": "Zhou X.", "AuthorID": "56843847700", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Division of Life Science, State Key Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience and Molecular Neuroscience Center, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "55721198000": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "55721198000", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "36437536800": {"Name": "Mok K.Y.", "AuthorID": "36437536800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57213551809": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57213551809", "AffiliationID": "60102083, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Brain Cognition and Brain Disease Institute, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7005549599": {"Name": "Fu A.K.Y.", "AuthorID": "7005549599", "AffiliationID": "60111413", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain Science, Disease, and Drug Development,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Shenzhen Research Institute"}, "7005756760": {"Name": "Ip N.Y.", "AuthorID": "7005756760", "AffiliationID": "60111413", "AffiliationName": "Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Brain Science, Disease, and Drug Development,Hong Kong University of Science and Technology Shenzhen Research Institute"}, "57213468401": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "57213468401", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "14068266200": {"Name": "Zhao Q.", "AuthorID": "14068266200", "AffiliationID": "60009860, 60073628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "57184553300": {"Name": "Chen K.", "AuthorID": "57184553300", "AffiliationID": "60009860, 60073628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "35484134200": {"Name": "Guo Q.", "AuthorID": "35484134200", "AffiliationID": "60009860, 60073628", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "57218425954": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57218425954", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of North Carolina"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
