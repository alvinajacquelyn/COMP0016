A three-stage qualitative methodology (interviews, focus group, Delphi-based inquiry) was used to examine the case of an emergent IoT-based business network in the UK road transport industry to examine: (i) how aspects of product use data influence the benefit opportunities the data provide to the different network actors; (ii) how capturing of the benefit opportunities in a network context is impacted by key barriers; and (iii) how network capabilities can overcome these barriers to capture benefits from product-use data. The study, thereby, contributes to an understanding of the industry 4.0 context from a resource dependency theory perspective and provides concrete recommendations for management operating in this context.", "AuthorKeywords": ["business network", "industrial internet", "Industry 4.0", "internet of things (IoT)", "resource dependence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Business networks", "Enabling technologies", "Internet of thing (IOT)", "Internet of Things (IOT)", "Qualitative methodologies", "Resource dependences", "Resource dependency theories", "UK road transport industry"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065994873", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"]], "AuthorData": {"8902630000": {"Name": "Schroeder A.", "AuthorID": "8902630000", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Aston Business School, Aston University"}, "56928424400": {"Name": "Ziaee Bigdeli A.", "AuthorID": "56928424400", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Aston Business School, Aston University"}, "7004171985": {"Name": "Baines T.", "AuthorID": "7004171985", "AffiliationID": "60116225", "AffiliationName": "Aston Business School, Aston University"}, "57070317800": {"Name": "Galera Zarco C.", "AuthorID": "57070317800", "AffiliationID": "60160797, 60017326", "AffiliationName": "Coventry University Business School, Coventry University"}}}
