The twins were official race pacers in a popular city marathon held in the early spring in the UK. Both recovered uneventfully due to the prompt recognition of EHS and use of aggressive cooling measures, which prevented life-threatening complications. The case illustrates that EHS is a complex illness with a possible genetic predisposition, which can occur among runners even in cooler conditions. This link is explored together with the influence of their role as race pacers and the additional backpack worn in the development of EHS.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Diseases in Twins", "Heat Stroke", "Humans", "Male", "Physical Exertion", "Running", "Twins, Monozygotic", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959506744", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57195719977": {"Name": "Smith R.", "AuthorID": "57195719977", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport and Exercise Medicine, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford University, Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57191889052": {"Name": "Jones N.", "AuthorID": "57191889052", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport and Exercise Medicine, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre, Oxford University, Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57202876121": {"Name": "Martin D.", "AuthorID": "57202876121", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Centre for Altitude, Space and Extreme Environment Medicine, Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health (ISEH)"}, "23973145600": {"Name": "Kipps C.", "AuthorID": "23973145600", "AffiliationID": "108342370", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Sciences, Institute of Sport, Exercise and Health (ISEH)"}}}
