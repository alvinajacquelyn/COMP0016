At the molecular scale, however, major gaps in understanding this phenomenon persist. Here we investigate through molecular dynamics simulations how the formation of precritical crystalline clusters is connected to the kinetics of nucleation. Considering heterogeneous water freezing as a prototypical scenario of practical relevance, we find that precritical fluctuations connote which crystalline polymorph will form. The emergence of metastable phases can thus be promoted by templating crystal faces characteristic of specific polymorphs. As a consequence, heterogeneous classical nucleation theory cannot describe our simulation results, because the different substrates lead to the formation of different ice polytypes. We discuss how the issue of polymorphism needs to be incorporated into analysis and comparison of heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation. Our results will help to interpret and analyze the growing number of experiments and simulations dealing with crystal polymorph selection.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039424919", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55781212900": {"Name": "Fitzner M.", "AuthorID": "55781212900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "26536720300": {"Name": "Sosso G.C.", "AuthorID": "26536720300", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Centre for Scientific Computing, University of Warwick"}, "56070111800": {"Name": "Pietrucci F.", "AuthorID": "56070111800", "AffiliationID": "60157961, 60028993, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie, De Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie, CNRS UMR 7590, IRD UMR 206, Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s - Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie Paris 6"}, "27467756600": {"Name": "Pipolo S.", "AuthorID": "27467756600", "AffiliationID": "60104665, 60018178, 60104292, 60008134, 60004410", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Lille, CNRS, Centrale Lille, ENSCL, Universit\u00e9 d' Artois UMR 8181 - UCCS Unit\u00e9 de Catalyse et Chimie du Solide"}}}
