To mitigate losses, rehabilitation is high on the conservation agenda. However, the relative functionality and ES delivery of rehabilitated mangroves in different intertidal locations is rarely assessed. In a case study from Panay Island, Philippines, using field- and satellite-derived methods, we assess carbon stocks and coastal protection potential of rehabilitated low-intertidal seafront and mid- to upper-intertidal abandoned (leased) fishpond areas, against reference natural mangroves. Due to large sizes and appropriate site conditions, targeted abandoned fishpond reversion to former mangrove was found to be favourable for enhancing CCMA in the coastal zone. In a municipality-specific case study, 96.7% of abandoned fishponds with high potential for effective greenbelt rehabilitation had favourable tenure status for reversion. These findings have implications for coastal zone management in Asia in the face of climate change.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abandoned aquaculture ponds", "Carbon stocks", "Coastal protection", "Ecosystem services", "Mangroves", "Rehabilitation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aquaculture ponds", "Carbon stocks", "Coastal protection", "Ecosystem services", "Mangroves", "Carbon", "Carbon Sequestration", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Ecosystem", "Environmental Restoration and Remediation", "Philippines", "Ponds", "Wetlands"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84990935161", "SubjectAreas": [["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"55532013600": {"Name": "Duncan C.", "AuthorID": "55532013600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}, "8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "55551610200": {"Name": "Thompson J.R.", "AuthorID": "55551610200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7003417458": {"Name": "Primavera J.H.", "AuthorID": "7003417458", "AffiliationID": "119210738", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London-Philippines"}, "57191481445": {"Name": "Loma R.J.A.", "AuthorID": "57191481445", "AffiliationID": "119210738", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London-Philippines"}, "14819276800": {"Name": "Koldewey H.J.", "AuthorID": "14819276800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ecology and Conservation, University of Exeter"}}}
