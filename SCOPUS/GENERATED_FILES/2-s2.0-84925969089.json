Methods: We measured markers of amyloid pathology (CSF b-amyloid 42) and neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume on MRI and cortical metabolism on [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET) in 201 patients with MCI clinically followed for up to 6 years to detect progressive cognitive deterioration. We categorized patients with MCI as A-/A+ and N+/N- based on presence/absence of amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration. SNAPs were A-N+ cases. Results: The proportion of progressors was 11% (8/41), 34% (14/41), 56% (19/34), and 71% (60/85) in A-N-, A+N-, SNAP, and A+N+, respectively; the proportion of APOE \u03b54 carriers was 29%, 70%, 31%, and 71%, respectively, with the SNAP group featuring a significantly different proportion than both A-N+ and A+N+ groups (p # 0.005). Hypometabolism in SNAP patients was comparable to A1N1 patients (p 5 0.154), while hippocampal atrophy was more severe in SNAP patients (p 5 0.002). Compared with A+N-, SNAP and A+N+ patients had significant risk of progressive cognitive deterioration (hazard ratio 5 2.7 and 3.8, p 5 0.016 and p , 0.001), while A+N- patients did not (hazard ratio 5 1.13, p 5 0.771). In A+N- and A+N+ groups, none of the biomarkers predicted time to progression. In the SNAP group, lower time to progression was correlated with greater hypometabolism (r 5 0.42, p 5 0.073). Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that patients with SNAP MCI feature a specific risk progression profile.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Databases, Factual", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mild Cognitive Impairment", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Predictive Value of Tests"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925969089", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"13908172500": {"Name": "Caroli A.", "AuthorID": "13908172500", "AffiliationID": "60029411", "AffiliationName": "Biomedical Engineering Department, Medical Imaging Unit, IRCCS Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri"}, "16744236000": {"Name": "Prestia A.", "AuthorID": "16744236000", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "LENITEM-Laboratory of Epidemiology Neuroimaging and Telemedicine, IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "6602161538": {"Name": "Galluzzi S.", "AuthorID": "6602161538", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "LENITEM-Laboratory of Epidemiology Neuroimaging and Telemedicine, IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "55735905600": {"Name": "Ferrari C.", "AuthorID": "55735905600", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "LENITEM-Laboratory of Epidemiology Neuroimaging and Telemedicine, IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "55913019300": {"Name": "Redolfi A.", "AuthorID": "55913019300", "AffiliationID": "60084291", "AffiliationName": "LENITEM-Laboratory of Epidemiology Neuroimaging and Telemedicine, IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli"}, "56214208300": {"Name": "Frisoni G.B.", "AuthorID": "56214208300", "AffiliationID": "60004718", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Internal Medicine and Psychiatry, University Hospitals and University of Geneva"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "Van Der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Center"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, VU University Medical Center"}, "6603412407": {"Name": "Van Berckel B.", "AuthorID": "6603412407", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Neurochemistry Laboratorium and Biobank, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, Neurochemistry Laboratorium and Biobank, VU University Medical Center"}, "6701704380": {"Name": "Teunissen C.", "AuthorID": "6701704380", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Oncology and Radiation Sciences, PET-Center, Uppsala University"}, "7102000770": {"Name": "Wall A.E.", "AuthorID": "7102000770", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Neurobiology Center, Karolinska Institutet"}, "23007332900": {"Name": "Carter S.F.", "AuthorID": "23007332900", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "MedTech West, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "35070295800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ll M.", "AuthorID": "35070295800", "AffiliationID": "60009950", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, School of Medicine, Chosun University"}, "12241666800": {"Name": "Choo I.H.", "AuthorID": "12241666800", "AffiliationID": "60103459, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Klinikum Rechts Der Isar, Technische Universitat Muenchen"}, "7102413103": {"Name": "Nordberg A.", "AuthorID": "7102413103", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "6507487659": {"Name": "Grimmer T.", "AuthorID": "6507487659", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geriatric Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge"}, "6603680777": {"Name": "Drzezga A.", "AuthorID": "6603680777", "AffiliationID": "60024025", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Cologne"}}}
