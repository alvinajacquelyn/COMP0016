Here, we demonstrate experimentally, for the first time, the capability of \u03bc-SORS to determine whether two detected chemical components originate from two separate layers or whether the two components are mixed together in a single layer. Such information is important in a number of areas, including conservation of cultural heritage objects, and is not available, for highly turbid media, from conventional Raman microscopy, where axial (confocal) scanning is not possible due to an inability to facilitate direct imaging within the highly scattering sample. This application constitutes an additional capability for \u03bc-SORS in addition to its basic capacity to determine the overall chemical make-up of layers in a turbid system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diffusel scattering", "Non-destructive", "Paintings", "SORS", "Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy", "Subsurface", "Turbid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Non destructive", "SORS", "Spatially offset raman spectroscopies", "Subsurface", "Turbid"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954570209", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"35395864300": {"Name": "Conti C.", "AuthorID": "35395864300", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Conservation and Valorization of Cultural Heritage (ICVBC), National Research Council"}, "6602126191": {"Name": "Realini M.", "AuthorID": "6602126191", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Conservation and Valorization of Cultural Heritage (ICVBC), National Research Council"}, "55796253700": {"Name": "Botteon A.", "AuthorID": "55796253700", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Conservation and Valorization of Cultural Heritage (ICVBC), National Research Council"}, "56979460300": {"Name": "Colombo C.", "AuthorID": "56979460300", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Conservation and Valorization of Cultural Heritage (ICVBC), National Research Council"}, "57062227400": {"Name": "Noll S.", "AuthorID": "57062227400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7401666431": {"Name": "Elliott S.R.", "AuthorID": "7401666431", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7005659005": {"Name": "Matousek P.", "AuthorID": "7005659005", "AffiliationID": "60023254, 60009523", "AffiliationName": "Central Laser Facility, Research Complex at Harwell, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory"}}}
