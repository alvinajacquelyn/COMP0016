Methods RAPID-axSpA (NCT01087762) was double-blind and placebo-controlled to week 24, dose-blind to week 48 and open-label to week 204. Patients were randomised to certolizumab pegol (CZP) or placebo. Placebo patients entering dose-blind were rerandomised to CZP. MRIs performed at baseline, weeks 12, 48 and 96 were scored by 2 reviewers independently: Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) for sacroiliac (SI) joints; Berlin modification of the Ankylosing Spondylitis spine MRI scoring system for disease activity (Berlin) for spine. Inflammation thresholds: SPARCC\u22652; Berlin>2. Remission thresholds: SPARCC<2 (SI joints); Berlin\u22642 (spine); Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) inactive disease (<1.3, clinical). Results Across 163 patients in the MRI set (109 CZP; 54 placebo), week 12 mean changes from baseline in MRI scores were greater for CZP versus placebo: SPARCC: '4.8 (SD 8.6) vs '1.6 (7.8; p<0.001); Berlin: '2.9 (4.2) vs 0.2 (4.8; p<0.001). Improvements were maintained to week 96. Week 12 MRI remission was achieved by 52.6% of patients with baseline MRI inflammation in SI joints, 62.0% in the spine and 37.9% of patients with both. MRI remission rates were sustained to week 96, with similar trends in r-axSpA and nr-axSpA. At week 96, 57.5% vs 65.9% of patients achieving versus not achieving clinical remission had MRI remission. Conclusions CZP reduced inflammation in the spine and SI joints in patients with r-axSpA and nr-axSpA, with improvements maintained over 96 \u20acweeks. Substantial proportions of patients achieved MRI remission. Concordance between clinical remission and current definitions of absence of MRI inflammation was limited.
