It is as yet unknown, however, whether such an imbalance reflects a predisposing vulnerability or results as a consequence of repeated and/or excessive alcohol exposure. We, therefore, examined the association of alcohol consumption with model-based goal-directed and model-free habitual control in 188 18-year-old social drinkers in a two-step sequential decision-making task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging before prolonged alcohol misuse could have led to severe neurobiological adaptations. Behaviorally, participants showed a mixture of model-free and model-based decision-making as observed previously. Measures of impulsivity were positively related to alcohol consumption. In contrast, neither model-free nor model-based decision weights nor the trade-off between them were associated with alcohol consumption. There were also no significant associations between alcohol consumption and neural correlates of model-free or model-based decision quantities in either ventral striatum or ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Exploratory whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses with a lenient threshold revealed early onset of drinking to be associated with an enhanced representation of model-free reward prediction errors in the posterior putamen. These results suggest that an imbalance between model-based goal-directed and model-free habitual control might rather not be a trait marker of alcohol intake per se.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alcohol", "goal-directed", "reinforcement learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Alcohol Drinking", "Brain", "Decision Making", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Goals", "Habits", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Motivation", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Reward", "Ventral Striatum"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010433509", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56578674400": {"Name": "Nebe S.", "AuthorID": "56578674400", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Center, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "55138681600": {"Name": "Kroemer N.B.", "AuthorID": "55138681600", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Center, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "56578368400": {"Name": "Bernhardt N.", "AuthorID": "56578368400", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "57187559400": {"Name": "M\u00fcller D.K.", "AuthorID": "57187559400", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Center, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "7003876844": {"Name": "Smolka M.N.", "AuthorID": "7003876844", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Center, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "24773657200": {"Name": "Schad D.J.", "AuthorID": "24773657200", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Social and Preventive Medicine, Area of Excellence Cognitive Sciences, University of Potsdam"}, "55883714500": {"Name": "Sebold M.", "AuthorID": "55883714500", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "57201513357": {"Name": "Heinz A.", "AuthorID": "57201513357", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin"}, "56577545000": {"Name": "Rapp M.A.", "AuthorID": "56577545000", "AffiliationID": "60021763", "AffiliationName": "Social and Preventive Medicine, Area of Excellence Cognitive Sciences, University of Potsdam"}, "55776198600": {"Name": "Scholl L.", "AuthorID": "55776198600", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "36560275600": {"Name": "Kuitunen-Paul S.", "AuthorID": "36560275600", "AffiliationID": "60018353", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden"}, "14056255700": {"Name": "Huys Q.J.M.", "AuthorID": "14056255700", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Addictive Disorders, Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, Hospital of Psychiatry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}}}
