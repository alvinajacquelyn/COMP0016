Aim: To understand people's help-seeking decision making for cancer alarm symptoms, without imposing a cancer context. Design and setting: Community-based, qualitative interview study in the UK, using purposive sampling by sex, socioeconomic status, and prior help seeking, with framework analysis of transcripts. Method: Interviewees (n = 48) were recruited from a community-based sample (n = 1724) of adults aged \u226550 years who completed a health survey that included a list of symptoms. Cancer was not mentioned. Participants reporting any of 10 cancer alarm symptoms (n = 915) and who had consented to contact (n = 482) formed the potential pool from which people were invited to an interview focusing on their symptom experiences. Results: Reasons for help seeking included symptom persistence, social influence, awareness/ fear of a link with cancer, and 'just instinct'. Perceiving the symptom as trivial or 'normal' was a deterrent, as was stoicism, adopting self-management strategies, and fear of investigations. Negative attitudes to help seeking were common. Participants did not want to be seen as making a fuss, did not want to waste the doctor's time, and were sometimes not confident that the GP could help. Conclusion: Decision making about cancer alarm symptoms was complex. Recognition of cancer risk almost always motivated help seeking (more so than the fear of cancer being a deterrent), assisted by recent public-awareness campaigns. As well as symptom persistence motivating help seeking, it could also have the reverse effect. Negative attitudes to help seeking were significant deterrents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["'Alarm' symptoms", "Awareness", "Cancer", "Fear", "General practice", "Help-seeking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Decision Making", "Delayed Diagnosis", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Primary Health Care", "Qualitative Research", "Retrospective Studies", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921784404", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"24167321100": {"Name": "Whitaker K.L.", "AuthorID": "24167321100", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, Duke of Kent Building, University of Surrey"}, "56335153400": {"Name": "Winstanley K.", "AuthorID": "56335153400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, University College London"}, "57207811596": {"Name": "Macleod U.", "AuthorID": "57207811596", "AffiliationID": "60107756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care Medicine, Hull York Medical School"}, "14034513700": {"Name": "Scott S.E.", "AuthorID": "14034513700", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Social and Behavioural Sciences, King's College London Dental Institute"}}}
