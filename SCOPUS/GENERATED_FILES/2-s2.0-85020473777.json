Research into collaborative practice has identified a number of barriers to and facilitators of collaborative practice, but there has been limited research into how well prepared newly qualified SLTs are to carry out collaborative practice or their beliefs about its value. There is emerging research into the teaching of collaborative practice in higher education institutions; however, studies have typically focused on medical professions, with limited research into the teaching of collaborative practice for allied health professionals. This study set out to explore newly qualified SLTs' beliefs about the value of collaborative practice; barriers to and facilitators of collaborative practice in paediatric work settings; the effectiveness of the teaching of collaborative practice on their pre-registration higher education course; and how the teaching of collaborative practice on SLT university courses could be improved. Semi-structured telephone interviews were carried out with 10 newly qualified speech and language therapists. Responses were analysed qualitatively using thematic analysis. Results indicated that participants in this study regard collaborative practice as important for effective practice, particularly for the purpose of delivering intervention. The participants typically described their role as a provider and receiver of information about a child, but only as a provider of skills. This lack of reciprocity may be an additional barrier to effective working relationships with school staff. Participants emphasized the need for better links between theory and practice in the teaching of collaborative practice at university, and were disappointed by the variability of opportunities to experience collaboration on placement. Increasing the value of collaborative practice could be addressed by assessing it in line with more traditional clinical skills. Additionally, engagement with other professionals at university through case-based workshops could ensure that all students have equitable opportunities to experience and develop skills in collaborative practice. This study adds to the literature on barriers to and facilitators of collaborative practice. It also serves as a preliminary study to enrich understanding of the beliefs of newly qualified SLTs regarding the current teaching of collaborative practice and indicate how learning opportunities could be improved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beliefs", "collaboration", "collaborative practice", "SLT", "speech and language therapist", "teaching", "universities"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020473777", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57194500099": {"Name": "Jago S.", "AuthorID": "57194500099", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Chandler House"}, "56249268900": {"Name": "Radford J.", "AuthorID": "56249268900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, Chandler House"}}}
