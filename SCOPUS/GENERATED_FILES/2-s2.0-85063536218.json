We explore the host galaxy of the brightest quasar in the large-volume cosmological hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides. The brightest quasar in BlueTides has a luminosity of \u223c a few 1013 L\u2609 and black hole mass of 6.4 x 108 M\u2609 at z \u223c 7.5, comparable to the observed quasar. The quasar resides in a rare halo of mass MH \u223c 1012 M\u2609 and has a host galaxy of stellar mass 4 x 1010 M\u2609 with an ongoing (intrinsic) star formation rate of \u223c80 M\u2609 yr\u22121. The corresponding intrinsic ultraviolet (UV) magnitude of the galaxy is roughly 2.7 mag fainter than the quasar's magnitude and the galaxy is highly metal enriched with mean metallicity equal to the solar value. We derive the quasar and galaxy spectral energy distribution in the mid- and near-infrared JWST bands. Finally, we predict a significant amount of dust attenuation in the rest-frame UV corresponding to A1500 \u223c 1.7, giving a UV-based star formation rate of \u223c14 M\u2609 yr\u22121. We present mock JWST images of the galaxy in different MIRI and NIRCam filters. The host galaxy is detectable in NIRCam filters, but is extremely compact (RE = 0.35 kpc). It will require JWST's exquisite sensitivity and resolution to separate the galaxy from the central point source.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Early Universe", "Galaxies: high-redshift", "Hydrodynamics", "Methods: numerical"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063536218", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"56152658800": {"Name": "Tenneti A.", "AuthorID": "56152658800", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "57190392609": {"Name": "Di Matteo T.", "AuthorID": "57190392609", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "35299209400": {"Name": "Croft R.A.C.", "AuthorID": "35299209400", "AffiliationID": "60027950", "AffiliationName": "McWilliams Center for Cosmology, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University"}, "23973913700": {"Name": "Wilkins S.M.", "AuthorID": "23973913700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}, "54580801600": {"Name": "Feng Y.", "AuthorID": "54580801600", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, Department of Physics, University of California Berkeley"}}}
