However, the contribution of tissue mechanics to wound healing in vivo remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the relationship between tissue mechanics and wound healing in live Drosophila wing imaginal discs and show that by tuning epithelial cell junctional tension, we can systematically alter the rate of wound healing. Coincident with the contraction of an actomyosin purse string, we observe cells flowing past each other at the wound edge by intercalating, reminiscent of molecules in a fluid, resulting in seamless wound closure. Using a cell-based physical model, we predict that a reduction in junctional tension fluidizes the tissue through an increase in intercalation rate and corresponding reduction in bulk viscosity, in the manner of an unjamming transition. The resultant fluidization of the tissue accelerates wound healing. Accordingly, when we experimentally reduce tissue tension in wing discs, the intercalation rate increases and wounds repair in less time.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bulk viscosity", "Collective behaviour", "Epithelial cells", "Epithelial tissue", "Physical model", "Rate increase", "Tissue mechanics", "Unjamming transition"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070802310", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56853688900": {"Name": "Tetley R.", "AuthorID": "56853688900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "55459037100": {"Name": "Mao Y.", "AuthorID": "55459037100", "AffiliationID": "60064143", "AffiliationName": "College of Information and Control, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology"}, "57191558257": {"Name": "Staddon M.", "AuthorID": "57191558257", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "53363223100": {"Name": "Banerjee S.", "AuthorID": "53363223100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics & Astronomy, University College London"}, "36673030800": {"Name": "Heller D.", "AuthorID": "36673030800", "AffiliationID": "60026285", "AffiliationName": "SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Quartier Sorge, Batiment Genopode"}, "20334512600": {"Name": "Hoppe A.", "AuthorID": "20334512600", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science, Engineering and Computing, Kingston University"}}}
