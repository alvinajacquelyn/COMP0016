All rights reserved.Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) techniques such as Photo-Activation Localization Microscopy (PALM) and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) enable fluorescence microscopy super-resolution: The overcoming of the resolution barrier imposed by the diffraction of light. These techniques are based on acquiring hundreds or thousands of images of single molecules, locating them and reconstructing a higher-resolution image from the high-precision localizations. These methods generally imply a considerable trade-off between imaging speed and resolution, limiting their applicability to high-throughput workflows. Recent advancements in scientific Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (sCMOS) camera sensors and localization algorithms reduce the temporal requirements for SMLM, pushing it toward high-throughput microscopy. Here we outline the decisions researchers face when considering how to adapt hardware on a new system for sCMOS sensors with high-throughput in mind.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hardware", "Homogenization", "SCMOS", "Single-molecule localization"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Molecular Imaging", "Photomicrography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957441371", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"55754360400": {"Name": "Almada P.", "AuthorID": "55754360400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "Quantitative Imaging and NanoBiophysics Group, MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56177001000": {"Name": "Culley S.", "AuthorID": "56177001000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "Quantitative Imaging and NanoBiophysics Group, MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "30067763700": {"Name": "Henriques R.", "AuthorID": "30067763700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60010269", "AffiliationName": "Quantitative Imaging and NanoBiophysics Group, MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology and Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
