Acceptability of PST-AD was high, as indicated by frequency of session attendance and through qualitative analyses of exit interviews. Fidelity was >80% for the first two sessions of PST-AD but fidelity to the adherence component of PST-AD dropped by session 4. Contamination occurred, in that seven patients in the control arm received one or two PST-AD sessions before follow-up assessment. Routine health records proved unreliable for measuring HIV viral load at follow-up. Barriers to measuring adherence electronically included device failure and participant perception of being helped by the research device. The study was not powered to detect clinical differences, however, promising change at 6-months follow-up was seen in electronic adherence, viral load suppression (PST-AD arm 9/12 suppressed; control arm 4/8 suppressed) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire\u20144.7 points in PST-AD arm vs. control, adjusted p value = 0.01). Results inform and justify a future randomised controlled trial of task-shifted PST-AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adherence", "Depression", "Intervention", "Problem solving", "Sub-Saharan Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Depression", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Middle Aged", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Personnel Staffing and Scheduling", "Problem Solving", "Program Evaluation", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008482404", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"7004595649": {"Name": "Abas M.", "AuthorID": "7004595649", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service & Population Research Department, Centre for Public Mental Health, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "56583922700": {"Name": "Macpherson K.", "AuthorID": "56583922700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service & Population Research Department, Centre for Public Mental Health, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "49662798900": {"Name": "Croome N.", "AuthorID": "49662798900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service & Population Research Department, Centre for Public Mental Health, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King\u2019s College London"}, "56584672600": {"Name": "Nyamayaro P.", "AuthorID": "56584672600", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "College of Health Sciences, University of Zimbabwe"}, "57192871333": {"Name": "Saruchera E.", "AuthorID": "57192871333", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "College of Health Sciences, University of Zimbabwe"}, "36508929300": {"Name": "Mangezi W.", "AuthorID": "36508929300", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "College of Health Sciences, University of Zimbabwe"}, "6505908396": {"Name": "Chibanda D.", "AuthorID": "6505908396", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention Project, Department of Community Medicine, University of Zimbabwe"}, "56584209900": {"Name": "Bere T.", "AuthorID": "56584209900", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention Project, Department of Community Medicine, University of Zimbabwe"}, "54585706800": {"Name": "Mothobi N.", "AuthorID": "54585706800", "AffiliationID": "106791487", "AffiliationName": "Parirenyatwa General Hospital"}, "24765744300": {"Name": "Simms V.", "AuthorID": "24765744300", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine"}, "36126628200": {"Name": "Magidson J.", "AuthorID": "36126628200", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School"}, "6507740607": {"Name": "Makadzange A.", "AuthorID": "6507740607", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School"}, "55870816100": {"Name": "O\u2019Cleirigh C.", "AuthorID": "55870816100", "AffiliationID": "60029929, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School"}, "6603734182": {"Name": "Safren S.", "AuthorID": "6603734182", "AffiliationID": "60029251", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Miami"}}}
