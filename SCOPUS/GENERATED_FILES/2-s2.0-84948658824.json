Though behavioral studies in infancy have investigated infants' discrimination of body-related multisensory stimuli, whether they attribute this information as belonging to the self is still unknown. In human adults, neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the recruitment of a specific set of brain regions in response to body-related multisensory integration. To test whether the infant brain integrates this information similarly to adults, in a first functional near-infrared spectroscopy study we investigated the role of visual-proprioceptive feedback when temporal cues are manipulated by showing 5-month-old infants an online video of their own face while the infant was performing movements. To explore the role of body-related contingency further, in a second study we investigated whether cortical activation in response to self-initiated movements and external tactile stimulationwas similar to that found in the first study. Our results indicate that infants' specialized cortical activation in response to body-related contingencies is similar to brain activation seen in response to body awareness in adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Body awareness", "Cognitive development", "Infant development", "Multisensory integration", "Near-infrared spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Awareness", "Cerebral Cortex", "Feedback, Sensory", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Proprioception", "Psychomotor Performance", "Self Concept", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared", "Touch Perception", "Visual Perception"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948658824", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"55930991200": {"Name": "Filippetti M.L.", "AuthorID": "55930991200", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, University of London"}, "25230332300": {"Name": "Lloyd-Fox S.", "AuthorID": "25230332300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, University of London"}, "36072829800": {"Name": "Johnson M.H.", "AuthorID": "36072829800", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, University of London"}, "15765869300": {"Name": "Longo M.R.", "AuthorID": "15765869300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, University of London"}, "6602667335": {"Name": "Farroni T.", "AuthorID": "6602667335", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Psicologia Dello Sviluppo e della Socializzazione, University of Padua"}}}
