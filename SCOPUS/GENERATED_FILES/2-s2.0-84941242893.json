These heterostructures offers excellent current-carrying abilities whilst offering the prospect of a fast, low cost and easy methodology for device applications. The use of ND monolayers is also a compatible technology for the support of large area graphene films. The nature of the C-H bonds between graphene and H-terminated NDs strongly influences the electronic character of the heterostructure, creating effective charge redistribution within the system. Field effect transistors (FETs) have been fabricated based on this novel herterostructure to demonstrate device characteristics and the potential of this approach.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84941242893", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55825921200": {"Name": "Zhao F.", "AuthorID": "55825921200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "57219589306": {"Name": "Vrajitoarea A.", "AuthorID": "57219589306", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "36573632900": {"Name": "Jiang Q.", "AuthorID": "36573632900", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56328578400": {"Name": "Han X.", "AuthorID": "56328578400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "25222760700": {"Name": "Chaudhary A.", "AuthorID": "25222760700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "26028206500": {"Name": "Welch J.O.", "AuthorID": "26028206500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "22992826600": {"Name": "Jackman R.B.", "AuthorID": "22992826600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
