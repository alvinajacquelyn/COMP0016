We therefore measured circulating miR-122 in the prospective population-based Bruneck Study (n = 810; survey year 1995). Circulating miR-122 was associated with prevalent insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and an adverse lipid profile. Among 92 plasma proteins and 135 lipid subspecies quantified with mass spectrometry, it correlated inversely with zinc-a-2-glycoprotein and positively with afamin, complement factor H, VLDL-associated apolipoproteins, and lipid subspecies containing monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids. Proteomics analysis of livers from antagomiR-122-treated mice revealed novel regulators of hepatic lipid metabolism that are responsive to miR-122 inhibition. In the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT, n = 155), 12-month atorvastatin reduced circulating miR-122. A similar response to atorvastatin was observed in mice and cultured murine hepatocytes. Over up to 15 years of follow-up in the Bruneck Study, multivariable adjusted risk ratios per one-SD higher log miR-122 were 1.60 (95% CI 1.30-1.96; P < 0.001) for metabolic syndrome and 1.37 (1.03-1.82; P = 0.021) for type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, circulating miR-122 is strongly associated with the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in the general population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Animals", "Atorvastatin Calcium", "Blotting, Northern", "Carrier Proteins", "Complement Factor H", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Dyslipidemias", "Female", "Glycoproteins", "Hepatocytes", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Incidence", "Insulin Resistance", "Lipid Metabolism", "Lipoproteins, VLDL", "Male", "Mass Spectrometry", "Metabolic Syndrome X", "Mice", "MicroRNAs", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Obesity", "Oligonucleotides", "Prevalence", "Prospective Studies", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Serum Albumin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011709989", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"]], "AuthorData": {"57201562616": {"Name": "Willeit P.", "AuthorID": "57201562616", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "57188648329": {"Name": "Skroblin P.", "AuthorID": "57188648329", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's British Heart Foundation Centre, King's College London"}, "9732719200": {"Name": "Yin X.", "AuthorID": "9732719200", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's British Heart Foundation Centre, King's College London"}, "55543517100": {"Name": "Kaudewitz D.", "AuthorID": "55543517100", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's British Heart Foundation Centre, King's College London"}, "23979085000": {"Name": "Zampetaki A.", "AuthorID": "23979085000", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's British Heart Foundation Centre, King's College London"}, "36522352900": {"Name": "Barwari T.", "AuthorID": "36522352900", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's British Heart Foundation Centre, King's College London"}, "57193206432": {"Name": "Whitehead M.", "AuthorID": "57193206432", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's British Heart Foundation Centre, King's College London"}, "35242900900": {"Name": "Mayr M.", "AuthorID": "35242900900", "AffiliationID": "60100024, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's British Heart Foundation Centre, King's College London"}, "7006421480": {"Name": "Willeit J.", "AuthorID": "7006421480", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "57207788534": {"Name": "Kiechl S.", "AuthorID": "57207788534", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "9239207500": {"Name": "Moschen A.R.", "AuthorID": "9239207500", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine i (Endocrinology, Gastroenterology and Metabolic Diseases), Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "7006594877": {"Name": "Tilg H.", "AuthorID": "7006594877", "AffiliationID": "60008222", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine i (Endocrinology, Gastroenterology and Metabolic Diseases), Medical University of Innsbruck"}, "8956417600": {"Name": "Ram\u00edrez C.M.", "AuthorID": "8956417600", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Biology and Therapeutics Program, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "42561259100": {"Name": "Goedeke L.", "AuthorID": "42561259100", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Biology and Therapeutics Program, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "9735359100": {"Name": "Rotllan N.", "AuthorID": "9735359100", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Biology and Therapeutics Program, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "8634881600": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Hernando C.", "AuthorID": "8634881600", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Vascular Biology and Therapeutics Program, Yale University School of Medicine"}, "7004495052": {"Name": "Bonora E.", "AuthorID": "7004495052", "AffiliationID": "60060733", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolic Diseases, University and Hospital Trust of Verona"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57193142562": {"Name": "Santer P.", "AuthorID": "57193142562", "AffiliationID": "100325715", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Bruneck Hospital"}}}
