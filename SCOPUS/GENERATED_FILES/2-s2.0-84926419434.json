We aimed to evaluate the agreement among clinicians to select candidates for liver biopsy early after LT. From a protocol biopsy population (n = 690), we randomly selected 100 LT patients in whom the biopsy was taken 7-10 days after LT. The clinical information between LT and protocol biopsy was given to nine clinicians from three transplant centres who decided whether a liver biopsy was needed. The agreement among clinicians to select candidates for liver biopsy was poor: \u03ba = 0.06-0.62, being \u03ba < 0.40 in 76% of comparisons. The concordance between indication for liver biopsy and moderate-severe ACR in the protocol biopsy was \u03ba < 0.30 in all cases. A multivariate model based on the product age-by-MELD (OR = 0.81; P = 0.013), delta eosinophils (OR = 1.5; P = 0.002) and mean tacrolimus trough concentrations <6 ng/ml within the prior 4 days (OR = 11.4; P = 0.047) had an AUROC = 0.84 to diagnose moderate-severe histological ACR. In conclusion, the agreement among clinicians to select patients for liver biopsy is very poor. If further validated the proposed model would provide an objective method to select candidates for liver biopsy after LT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute cellular rejection", "biopsy", "concordance", "diagnosis", "liver transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biopsy", "Female", "Graft Rejection", "Humans", "Liver", "Liver Transplantation", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Patient Selection"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926419434", "SubjectAreas": [["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"36606777300": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez-Per\u00e1lvarez M.", "AuthorID": "36606777300", "AffiliationID": "60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital, IMIBIC CIBERehd"}, "55934306400": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Caparr\u00f5s C.", "AuthorID": "55934306400", "AffiliationID": "60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital, IMIBIC CIBERehd"}, "6507747168": {"Name": "Poyato-Gonz\u00e1lez A.", "AuthorID": "6507747168", "AffiliationID": "60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital, IMIBIC CIBERehd"}, "56518225700": {"Name": "Guerrero-Misas M.", "AuthorID": "56518225700", "AffiliationID": "60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital, IMIBIC CIBERehd"}, "6508335904": {"Name": "Montero-\u00c1lvarez J.L.", "AuthorID": "6508335904", "AffiliationID": "60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital, IMIBIC CIBERehd"}, "35228822000": {"Name": "Barrera P.", "AuthorID": "35228822000", "AffiliationID": "60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital, IMIBIC CIBERehd"}, "7003903814": {"Name": "Brice\u00f1o J.", "AuthorID": "7003903814", "AffiliationID": "60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital, IMIBIC CIBERehd"}, "57217097112": {"Name": "De La Mata M.", "AuthorID": "57217097112", "AffiliationID": "60031142", "AffiliationName": "Department of Hepatology and Liver Transplantation, Reina Sof\u00eda University Hospital, IMIBIC CIBERehd"}, "16023392700": {"Name": "Tsochatzis E.", "AuthorID": "16023392700", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, University Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "18133593300": {"Name": "Germani G.", "AuthorID": "18133593300", "AffiliationID": "60027298", "AffiliationName": "Multivisceral Transplant Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, Padova University Hospital"}, "36992902000": {"Name": "Hogan B.", "AuthorID": "36992902000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, University Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6701855309": {"Name": "O'Beirne J.", "AuthorID": "6701855309", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, University Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7003739447": {"Name": "Patch D.", "AuthorID": "7003739447", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, University Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7101606450": {"Name": "Dhillon A.P.", "AuthorID": "7101606450", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, University Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56450243500": {"Name": "Burroughs A.K.", "AuthorID": "56450243500", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre, University Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "56888907700": {"Name": "Senzolo M.", "AuthorID": "56888907700", "AffiliationID": "60027298", "AffiliationName": "Multivisceral Transplant Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, Padova University Hospital"}, "7005916237": {"Name": "Burra P.", "AuthorID": "7005916237", "AffiliationID": "60027298", "AffiliationName": "Multivisceral Transplant Unit, Department of Gastroenterology, Padova University Hospital"}}}
