In doing so it enables them to become more aware of how they can tackle local issues. We report here on the development and uptake of the 'City-Commons Framework for Citizen Sensing', a conceptual model that builds on Participatory Action Research with the aim of playing an integrating role: outlining the processes and mechanisms for ensuring sensing technologies are co-designed by citizens to address their concerns. At the heart of the framework is the idea of a city commons: a pool of community-managed resources. We discuss how the framework was used by communities in Bristol to measure and monitor the problem of damp housing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Citizen engagement", "Citizen sensing", "Commons", "Framework", "Methods", "Open data", "Publics", "Smart cities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Citizen engagements", "Citizen sensing", "Commons", "Framework", "Methods", "Open datum", "Publics"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022319766", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55442672400": {"Name": "Balestrini M.", "AuthorID": "55442672400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "7003925319": {"Name": "Rogers Y.", "AuthorID": "7003925319", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "57191485447": {"Name": "Marshall P.", "AuthorID": "57191485447", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "57201447867": {"Name": "Hassan C.", "AuthorID": "57201447867", "AffiliationID": "120486061", "AffiliationName": "Knowle West Media Centre"}, "57201452152": {"Name": "King M.", "AuthorID": "57201452152", "AffiliationID": "120486061", "AffiliationName": "Knowle West Media Centre"}, "57201451842": {"Name": "Creus J.", "AuthorID": "57201451842", "AffiliationID": "120486106", "AffiliationName": "Ideas for Change"}}}
