Background: In clinical practice, the use of plasma \u03b2-Amyloid1\u201342 (A\u03b2 1\u201342 ) as biomarker for Alzheimer's disease is largely limited by the absence of reference values. The aim of this study was to evaluate A\u03b2 1\u201342 plasma concentrations in cognitively normal subjects and to propose reference values. Methods: Plasma samples were obtained from 245 subjects, with a wide age-range (19\u201389 years), enrolled at the Unit of Laboratory Medicine of the \u201cAzienda Ospedaliera Cardinale G. Panico\u201d (younger subjects) and from a population-based study on aging (GreatAGE study) (older subjects). Three different age-groups were established: young (\u2264 34), adult (35 \u2264 age \u2264 64) and old (>64). The Innogenetics Elisa kit for plasma A\u03b2 1\u201342 was used for the analysis. Results: The mean (SD) concentration of plasma A\u03b2 1\u201342 was 17.65 (5.71) pg/mL. A positive trend was found in A\u03b2 1\u201342 levels across the three age groups (p <.0001): young subjects showed values of A\u03b2 1\u201342 significantly lower than the adult group (p <.0001) and than the old one (p <.0001 overall); no significant differences were found between the adult and the old groups (p = 1.0000). For the entire cohort the lower limit of 90% Reference Interval, double-sided, was 8.12 pg/mL (95% CI 6.77\u20139.45) and the upper limit was 29.00 pg/mL (95% CI 27.01\u201331.00). Conclusion: The present study proposes reference values for plasma A\u03b2 1\u201342 . Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm these results and corroborate the use of these reference values in clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "A\u03b2 peptide", "Biomarker", "Plasma", "Reference values", "\u03b2-amyloid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Cognition", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Reference Values", "Sex Characteristics", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048968461", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57199511343": {"Name": "Zecca C.", "AuthorID": "57199511343", "AffiliationID": "60022778", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Clinical Research in Neurology, University of Bari \u201cAldo Moro\u201d at \u201cPia Fondazione Card.
