We assume that commuters either tune in to some TV/radio channel, or submit requests for content they desire to watch or listen to, which eventually forms a playlist of videos/podcasts/tunes. Given that connectivity is challenged by the movement of trains and the disconnection that this movement causes, users collabo-ratively download (through cellular and WiFi connections) and share content, in order to maintain undisrupted playback. We model collaborative media streaming for the case of the London Underground train network. The proposed quality assessment framework comprises a utility function which characterises the Quality of Experience (QoE) that users (subjectively) perceive and takes into account all the necessary parameters that affect smooth playback. The framework can be used to assess the media streaming quality in any railway network, after adjusting the related parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the perceptual quality of collaborative media streaming in (underground) railway networks from a modelling perspective, as opposed to a systems perspective. Based on real commuter traces from the London Underground network, we evaluate whether audio and video can be streamed to commuters with acceptable QoE. Our results show that even with very high-speed Internet connection, users still experience disruptions, but a carefully designed collaborative mechanism can result in high levels of perceived QoE even in such disruptive scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaborative Video/Audio Streaming", "Crowdsourcing", "Mobile Video/Audio Delivery"], "IndexKeywords": ["High-speed internet connection", "London Underground", "Mobile video", "Perceptual quality", "Quality assessment", "Quality of experience (QoE)", "Utility functions", "Wi-Fi connections"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982242957", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"55361226700": {"Name": "Tasiopoulos A.", "AuthorID": "55361226700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "16048105300": {"Name": "Psaras I.", "AuthorID": "16048105300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15726695000": {"Name": "Sourlas V.", "AuthorID": "15726695000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7003707235": {"Name": "Pavlou G.", "AuthorID": "7003707235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
