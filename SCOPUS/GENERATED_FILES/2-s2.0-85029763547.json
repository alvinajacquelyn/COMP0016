Fifty centres provided URR data on more than 90% of prevalent haemodialysis (HD) patients. . The proportion of patients in the UK who met the Renal Association clinical practice guideline for URR (>65%) increased from 77.7% in 2002 to 88.1% in 2015. . There was persistent variation observed between centres, 20 centres attaining the RA clinical practice guideline in >.90% of patients and 36 centres attaining the guideline in 70-90% of patients. . Patients over the age of 70 years achieved a higher median URR (76.0%) compared to younger patients (<70 years, URR 75.0%). . The overall proportion of prevalent HD patients with a URR >65% has continued to improve over time. . Whilst the majority of UK patients achieved the target URR there was wide variation between centres in the percentage of patients achieving the current guideline target.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adequacy", "Haemodialysis", "Urea reduction ratio"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Kidney Failure, Chronic", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Registries", "Renal Dialysis", "United Kingdom", "Urea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029763547", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"], ["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55437680000": {"Name": "Davenport A.", "AuthorID": "55437680000", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Hospital"}, "57195759940": {"Name": "Perisanidou L.I.", "AuthorID": "57195759940", "AffiliationID": "60116280", "AffiliationName": "UK Renal Registry"}, "12800982100": {"Name": "Steenkamp R.", "AuthorID": "12800982100", "AffiliationID": "60116280", "AffiliationName": "UK Renal Registry"}}}
