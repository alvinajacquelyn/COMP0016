All rights reserved.PACG is a more visually destructive form of disease than primary open-angle glaucoma. Primary angle-closure glaucoma is responsible for half of all glaucoma blindness worldwide. Most angle closure is asymptomatic. Primary angle-closure glaucoma is more common than historically thought in European-derived populations and all new primary glaucoma cases should be considered to be due to angle closure until proven otherwise by gonioscopy. Older people, women, and Asians are high-risk demographic groups. Ocular biometric risk factors are a thicker lens, a more anteriorly positioned lens, a shorter axial length, all acting to form a shallower anterior chamber. Laser iridotomy and laser iridoplasty are effective in the early stages of disease. There is a potential role for lens extraction in the management of primary angle-closure glaucoma.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944402694", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7201517537": {"Name": "Foster P.", "AuthorID": "7201517537", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "36028093000": {"Name": "Day A.", "AuthorID": "36028093000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "14052198000": {"Name": "Low S.", "AuthorID": "14052198000", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}}}
