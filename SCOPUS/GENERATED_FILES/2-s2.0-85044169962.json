These changes, if quantified with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), could be studied for use as an early biomarker for AD. The aim of our study was to determine if T 1 relaxation, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and quantitative magnetization transfer imaging (qMTI) metrics could reveal changes within the hippocampus and surrounding white matter structures in ex vivo transgenic mouse brains overexpressing human amyloid precursor protein with the Swedish mutation. Delineation of hippocampal cell layers using DTI color maps allows more detailed analysis of T 1 -weighted imaging, DTI, and qMTI metrics, compared with segmentation of gross anatomy based on relaxation images, and with analysis of DTI or qMTI metrics alone. These alterations are observed in the absence of robust intracellular A\u03b2 accumulation or plaque deposition as revealed by histology. This work demonstrates that multiparametric quantitative MRI methods are useful for characterizing changes within the hippocampal substructures and surrounding white matter tracts of mouse models of AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Animal model", "Dementia", "Diffusion", "Ex vivo", "Multiparametric", "Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Disease Models, Animal", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Transgenic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044169962", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57198451494": {"Name": "Whittaker H.", "AuthorID": "57198451494", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "57196412157": {"Name": "Noy S.", "AuthorID": "57196412157", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "14520663000": {"Name": "Wiseman F.", "AuthorID": "14520663000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "54969078100": {"Name": "Zhu S.", "AuthorID": "54969078100", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacology and Therapeutics, University of Manitoba"}, "24376541000": {"Name": "Martin M.", "AuthorID": "24376541000", "AffiliationID": "60017367", "AffiliationName": "Physics, University of Winnipeg"}, "36990236100": {"Name": "Di Curzio D.", "AuthorID": "36990236100", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "Pathology, University of Manitoba"}, "7005892281": {"Name": "Buist R.", "AuthorID": "7005892281", "AffiliationID": "60009697", "AffiliationName": "Radiology, University of Manitoba"}, "57192666539": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57192666539", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Psychiatry, University of Alberta"}, "36015763100": {"Name": "Thiessen J.", "AuthorID": "36015763100", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Medical Biophysics, Western University"}}}
