We describe teachers\u2019 practices in order to evaluate their contribution to Whole-Class Scaffolding in the context of a course that was meant to facilitate learning to solve mathematical problems in small groups. Sixteen and twenty four junior high students took part in two iterations of a design research correspondingly. We identify six teacher practices. These practices include: (1) Presenting strategy-oriented problems in order to familiarize students with mathematical problem solving strategies and heuristics; (2) Decomposing a problem into stages; (3) Modelling the use of the dedicated technologies; (4) Preliminary Learning to Learn Together (L2L2) talk; (5) Routine L2L2 talk; and (6) Summative L2L2 talk. We conclude that scaffolding learning to solve mathematical problem together in a whole-class context is feasible with suitable technologies. This study also provides insights on the Whole-Class Scaffolding theory and on the ways group learning could enhance students\u2019 ability to solve mathematical problems individually.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer-supported collaborative learning", "Learning to learn together", "Mathematical problem solving", "Whole-class scaffolding"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84947425824", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"39760988600": {"Name": "Abdu R.", "AuthorID": "39760988600", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Cognitive Sciences, The Hebrew University"}, "7103059799": {"Name": "Schwarz B.", "AuthorID": "7103059799", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, The Hebrew University"}, "25651815200": {"Name": "Mavrikis M.", "AuthorID": "25651815200", "AffiliationID": "60117699, 60033387", "AffiliationName": "London Knowledge Lab, University of London"}}}
