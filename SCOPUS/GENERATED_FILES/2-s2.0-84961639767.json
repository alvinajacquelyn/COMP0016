The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.We validate a Rp = 2.32 \u00b1 0.24R\u2297 planet on a close-in orbit (P = 2.260455 \u00b1 0.000041 days) around K2-28 (EPIC 206318379), a metal-rich M4-type dwarf in the Campaign 3 field of the K2 mission. Our follow-up observations included multi-band transit observations from the optical to the near-infrared, low-resolution spectroscopy, and high-resolution adaptive optics (AO) imaging. We perform a global fit to all of the observed transits using a Gaussian process-based method and show that the transit depths in all of the passbands adopted for the ground-based transit follow-ups (r2\u2033, zs,2, J, H, Ks) are within \u223c2\u03b1 of the K2 value. Based on a model of the background stellar population and the absence of nearby sources in our AO imaging, we estimate the probability that a background eclipsing binary could cause a false positive to be <2 \u00d7 10-5. We also show that K2-28 cannot have a physically associated companion of stellar type later than M4, based on the measurement of almost identical transit depths in multiple passbands. There is a low probability for an M4 dwarf companion (\u22480.072-0.04+0.02 ), but even if this were the case, the size of K2-28b falls within the planetary regime. K2-28b has the same radius (within 1\u03b1) and experiences irradiation from its host star similar to the well-studied GJ 1214b. Given the relative brightness of K2-28 in the near-infrared (mKep = 14.85 mag and mH = 11.03 mag) and relatively deep transit (0.6%-0.7%), a comparison between the atmospheric properties of these two planets with future observations would be especially interesting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["planets and satellites: detection", "stars: individual (EPIC 206318379, K2-28)", "techniques: photometric", "techniques: spectroscopic"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961639767", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55456655900": {"Name": "Hirano T.", "AuthorID": "55456655900", "AffiliationID": "60031126", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Tokyo Institute of Technology"}, "25641333500": {"Name": "Kuzuhara M.", "AuthorID": "25641333500", "AffiliationID": "60029701", "AffiliationName": "National Astronomical Observatory of Japan"}, "23492004900": {"Name": "Fukui A.", "AuthorID": "23492004900", "AffiliationID": "60029701", "AffiliationName": "Okayama Astrophysical Observatory, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan"}, "43361649700": {"Name": "Mann A.", "AuthorID": "43361649700", "AffiliationID": "60013372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of Texas at Austin"}, "36864449700": {"Name": "Sanchis-Ojeda R.", "AuthorID": "36864449700", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, University of California"}, "6701314322": {"Name": "Gaidos E.", "AuthorID": "6701314322", "AffiliationID": "60013791", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology and Geophysics, University of Hawai'i at Manoa"}, "8872076300": {"Name": "Narita N.", "AuthorID": "8872076300", "AffiliationID": "60106710", "AffiliationName": "Astrobiology Center, National Institutes of Natural Sciences"}, "7403258846": {"Name": "Tamura M.", "AuthorID": "7403258846", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo"}, "56285189800": {"Name": "Ryu T.", "AuthorID": "56285189800", "AffiliationID": "60021523", "AffiliationName": "SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies)"}, "55759816800": {"Name": "Onitsuka M.", "AuthorID": "55759816800", "AffiliationID": "60021523", "AffiliationName": "SOKENDAI (The Graduate University for Advanced Studies)"}, "8354937400": {"Name": "Kusakabe N.", "AuthorID": "8354937400", "AffiliationID": "60106710", "AffiliationName": "Astrobiology Center, National Institutes of Natural Sciences"}, "56939943400": {"Name": "Dai F.", "AuthorID": "56939943400", "AffiliationID": "60103460, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "56939492800": {"Name": "Yu L.", "AuthorID": "56939492800", "AffiliationID": "60103460, 60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "56607263100": {"Name": "Eylen V.", "AuthorID": "56607263100", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Stellar Astrophysics Centre, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Aarhus University"}, "35196197200": {"Name": "Lee C.", "AuthorID": "35196197200", "AffiliationID": "60029701", "AffiliationName": "Subaru Telescope, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan"}, "56286104500": {"Name": "Onozato H.", "AuthorID": "56286104500", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Astronomical Institute, Graduate School of Science, Tohoku University"}, "57201040448": {"Name": "Ito A.", "AuthorID": "57201040448", "AffiliationID": "60030526", "AffiliationName": "Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Hosei University"}, "57188551256": {"Name": "Tatsuuma M.", "AuthorID": "57188551256", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Astronomy, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo"}, "36938030400": {"Name": "Nowak G.", "AuthorID": "36938030400", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrofisica, Universidad de la Laguna (ULL)"}, "57188660772": {"Name": "Palle E.", "AuthorID": "57188660772", "AffiliationID": "60003044", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Astrofisica, Universidad de la Laguna (ULL)"}, "7003372967": {"Name": "Ribas I.", "AuthorID": "7003372967", "AffiliationID": "60103733, 60023020", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Ciencies de l'Espai (CSIC-IEEC), Carrer de Can Magrans, Campus UAB"}}}
