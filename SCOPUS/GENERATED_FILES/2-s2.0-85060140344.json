However, data on effectiveness of the evidence-based combination pharmacotherapy (EBCP) is limited. Objectives To determine the effect of EBCP on mortality and Cardiovascular events in patients with Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) or cerebrovascular disease. Methods Publications in EMBASE and Medline up to October 2018 were searched for cohort and case-control studies on EBCP for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The main outcomes were all-cause mortality and major cardiovascular events. Meta-analyses were performed based on random effects models. Results 21 studies were included. Comparing EBCP to either monotherapy or no therapy, the pooled risk ratios were 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.66) for all-cause mortality, 0.70 (0.62 to 0.79) for vascular mortality, 0.73 (0.64 to 0.83) for myocardial infarction and 0.79 (0.68 to 0.91) for cerebrovascular events. Optimal EBCP (all 4 classes of drug prescribed) had a risk ratio for all-cause mortality of 0.50 (0.40 to 0.64). This benefit became more dilute as the number of different classes of drug comprising EBCP was decreased\u2014for 3 classes of drug prescribed the risk ratio was 0.58 (0.49 to 0.69) and for 2 classes, the risk ratio was 0.67 (0.60 to 0.76). Conclusions EBCP reduces the risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with CHD or cerebrovascular disease. The different classes of drugs comprising EBCP work in an additive manner, with optimal EBCP conferring the greatest benefit.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Antihypertensive Agents", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cerebrovascular Disorders", "Coronary Disease", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Humans", "Hypolipidemic Agents", "Male", "Observational Studies as Topic", "Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors", "Secondary Prevention"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060140344", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57205465881": {"Name": "Ma T.T.", "AuthorID": "57205465881", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "55883514900": {"Name": "Man K.K.C.", "AuthorID": "55883514900", "AffiliationID": "60103563, 60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong"}, "57204678291": {"Name": "Wang Z.X.", "AuthorID": "57204678291", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "8448863300": {"Name": "Wei L.", "AuthorID": "8448863300", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Practice and Policy, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57205469760": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57205469760", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, Univeristy College London"}, "7003845955": {"Name": "Crake T.", "AuthorID": "7003845955", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital, West Smithfield"}, "6507229201": {"Name": "Ozkor M.A.", "AuthorID": "6507229201", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital, West Smithfield"}, "57205467839": {"Name": "Ding L.Q.", "AuthorID": "57205467839", "AffiliationID": "60018205", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Cardiovascular Hospital of Xiamen University"}, "57196127541": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "57196127541", "AffiliationID": "60019118, 60121741", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care Unit, First Affiliated Hospital, University of Science and Technology of China"}}}
