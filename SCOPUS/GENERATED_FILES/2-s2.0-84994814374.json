In those patients who do not respond to pharmacological or behavioural therapy, deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be a suitable option for potential symptom improvement. This manuscript attempts to summarise the outcomes of DBS at different targets, explore the possible mechanisms of action of DBS in TS, as well as the potential of adaptive DBS. There will also be a focus on the future challenges faced in designing optimized trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DBS", "Tourette syndrome", "TS deep brain stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994814374", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57194648353": {"Name": "Akbarian-Tefaghi L.", "AuthorID": "57194648353", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London (UCL)"}, "17136524800": {"Name": "Zrinzo L.", "AuthorID": "17136524800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, University College London (UCL), Institute of Neurology"}, "8984550100": {"Name": "Foltynie T.", "AuthorID": "8984550100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, University College London (UCL), Institute of Neurology"}}}
