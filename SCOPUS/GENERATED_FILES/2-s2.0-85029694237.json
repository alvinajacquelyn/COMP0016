Furthermore, if the explanation is in terms of a common cause, then the conditional probability distribution over the variables given the complete common cause should factorize. The principle is generalized by the formalism of causal models, in which the causal relationships among variables constrain the form of their joint probability distribution. In the quantum case, however, the observed correlations in Bell experiments cannot be explained in the manner Reichenbach\u2019s principle would seem to demand. Motivated by this, we introduce a quantum counterpart to the principle. We demonstrate that under the assumption that quantum dynamics is fundamentally unitary, if a quantum channel with input A and outputs B and C is compatible with A being a complete common cause of B and C, then it must factorize in a particular way. Finally, we show how to generalize our quantum version of Reichenbach\u2019s principle to a formalism for quantum causal models and provide examples of how the formalism works.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Causal explanations", "Causal model", "Causal relationships", "Conditional probability distributions", "Joint probability distributions", "Quantum channel", "Quantum counterpart", "Quantum dynamics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029694237", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55477919600": {"Name": "Allen J.M.A.", "AuthorID": "55477919600", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Wolfson Building"}, "55555249400": {"Name": "Barrett J.", "AuthorID": "55555249400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, Wolfson Building"}, "56684716700": {"Name": "Horsman D.C.", "AuthorID": "56684716700", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Durham"}, "56840890800": {"Name": "Lee C.M.", "AuthorID": "56840890800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6602168730": {"Name": "Spekkens R.W.", "AuthorID": "6602168730", "AffiliationID": "60031486", "AffiliationName": "Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics"}}}
