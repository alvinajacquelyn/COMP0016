They have an underlying trajectory picture that has a natural connection to semi-classical mechanics, allowing a simple pictorial interpretation of an evolving wavepacket. They also have better scaling with system size compared to conventional grid-based techniques. Here we review the variational multi-configurational Gaussian (vMCG) method. This is a variational solution to the TDSE, with explicit coupling between the Gaussian basis functions, resulting in a favourable convergence on the exact solution. The implementation of the method and its performance will be discussed with examples from non-adiabatic photo-excited dynamics and tunneling to show that it can correctly describe both of these strongly quantum mechanical processes. Particular emphasis is given to the implementation of the direct dynamics variant, DD-vMCG, where the potential surfaces are calculated on-the-fly via an interface to quantum chemistry programs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["direct quantum dynamics", "Gaussian wavepackets", "quantum dynamics simulations", "theoretical chemistry"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938313399", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"23981006900": {"Name": "Richings G.", "AuthorID": "23981006900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "57205033745": {"Name": "Polyak I.", "AuthorID": "57205033745", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "56748000300": {"Name": "Spinlove K.", "AuthorID": "56748000300", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "7006625328": {"Name": "Worth G.", "AuthorID": "7006625328", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "56823263500": {"Name": "Burghardt I.", "AuthorID": "56823263500", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Theoretical and Physical Chemistry, University of Frankfurt"}, "23990488700": {"Name": "Lasorne B.", "AuthorID": "23990488700", "AffiliationID": "60108488", "AffiliationName": "Institue of Charles Gerhardt, University of Montpellier"}}}
