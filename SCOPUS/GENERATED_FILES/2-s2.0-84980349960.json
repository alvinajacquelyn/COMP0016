The modern geometric approach is exploited to explore the system structure and a transformation is developed to facilitate observer design. Using the Lyapunov direct method, a robust asymptotic observer is presented which exploits the internal dynamic structure of the system as well as the structure of the uncertainties. The bounds on the uncertainties are nonlinear and are employed in the observer design to reject the effect of the uncertainties. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the approach and the simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Asymptotic observer", "Geometric approaches", "Internal dynamics", "Large-scale interconnected systems", "Lyapunov direct method", "System structures", "Unstructured uncertainty", "Variable structures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980349960", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57190493298": {"Name": "Mohamed M.", "AuthorID": "57190493298", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7403595938": {"Name": "Yan X.", "AuthorID": "7403595938", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "7005642573": {"Name": "Spurgeon S.", "AuthorID": "7005642573", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Instrumentation, Control and Embedded Systems Research Group, School of Engineering and Digital Arts, University of Kent"}, "15061533400": {"Name": "Mao Z.", "AuthorID": "15061533400", "AffiliationID": "60021666", "AffiliationName": "College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}}
