We first analyze the uplink ergodic achievable rates of the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver and the maximum-ratio combining receiver under Ricean fading conditions. We then examine the downlink ergodic achievable rates for the ZF and maximum-ratio transmitting precoders. The long-term and short-term normalization methods are introduced, which utilize long-term and instantaneous channel state information to implement the downlink power normalization, respectively. Also, approximations and asymptotic expressions of both the uplink and downlink rates are obtained, which facilitate the analog beam selection solutions to maximize the achievable rates. An exhaustive search provides the optimal results, but to reduce the time consumption, we resort to the derived rate limits and propose the second selection scheme based on the projected power of the line-of-sight paths. We then combine the advantages of the two schemes and propose a two-step scheme that achieves near-optimal performances with much less time consumption than exhaustive search. Numerical results confirm the analytical results of the ergodic achievable rate and reveal the effectiveness of the proposed two-step method.", "AuthorKeywords": ["beam selection", "DFT beams", "ergodic achievable rates", "Hybrid beamforming", "multiuser transmission"], "IndexKeywords": ["Beam selection", "DFT beams", "Ergodics", "Hybrid beamforming", "Multiuser transmissions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044871708", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56296819200": {"Name": "Han Y.", "AuthorID": "56296819200", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "55243233900": {"Name": "Jin S.", "AuthorID": "55243233900", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University"}, "55961790800": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "55961790800", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "57202148166": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57202148166", "AffiliationID": "60022381", "AffiliationName": "School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University"}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
