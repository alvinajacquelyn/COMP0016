We use this algorithm to correct errors occurring in a four-dimensional variant of the toric code, having open as opposed to periodic boundaries. For a phenomenological error model which includes measurement errors we use a five-dimensional version of our algorithm, achieving a threshold of 4.35 \u00b1 0.1%. For this error model, this is the highest known threshold of any topological code. Without measurement errors, a four-dimensional version of our algorithm can be used and we find a threshold of 7.3 \u00b1 0.1%. For the gate-based depolarizing error model, we find a threshold of 0.31 \u00b1 0.01% which is below the threshold found for the two-dimensional toric code.", "AuthorKeywords": ["error correcting codes", "Quantum computing", "smoothing method"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computationally efficient", "Face", "Hypercubic lattices", "Image color analysis", "Minimal surfaces", "Periodic boundaries", "Renormalization group", "Two-dimensional displays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056350068", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"55542707200": {"Name": "Duivenvoorden K.", "AuthorID": "55542707200", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "JARA Institute for Quantum Information, RWTH Aachen University"}, "56721266800": {"Name": "Breuckmann N.P.", "AuthorID": "56721266800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004176595": {"Name": "Terhal B.M.", "AuthorID": "7004176595", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "QuTech, Delft University of Technology"}}}
