Their phenotypic and functional roles have been investigated in humans, mice and other animals, such as the rat, pig and cow. To date, detailed phenotypic analysis of monocytes has not been undertaken in dogs. Two important surface markers in human monocytes are CD14 and MHC class II (MHC II). By flow cytometry, we demonstrated that canine monocytes can be subdivided into three separate populations: CD14posMHC IIneg, CD14posMHC IIpos and CD14negMHC IIpos. Both light and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the monocytic identity of all three populations. The CD14posMHC IIneg population could be distinguished on an ultrastructural level by their smaller size, the presence of more numerous, larger granules, and more pseudopodia than both of the other populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD14", "CD16", "Innate immunity", "MHC class II", "Monocyte", "Subpopulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Dogs", "Flow Cytometry", "Genes, MHC Class II", "Lipopolysaccharide Receptors", "Microscopy", "Microscopy, Electron, Transmission", "Monocytes", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023644602", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"]], "AuthorData": {"57194852969": {"Name": "Gibbons N.", "AuthorID": "57194852969", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Immune Regulation Laboratory, Comparative Physiology and Medicine Research Group, Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, Camden Campus"}, "36157040000": {"Name": "Goulart M.R.", "AuthorID": "36157040000", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Immune Regulation Laboratory, Comparative Physiology and Medicine Research Group, Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, Camden Campus"}, "57196068907": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57196068907", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Immune Regulation Laboratory, Comparative Physiology and Medicine Research Group, Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, Camden Campus"}, "7006432340": {"Name": "Garden O.A.", "AuthorID": "7006432340", "AffiliationID": "60138420, 60006297", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences & Advanced Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, School of Veterinary Medicine"}, "57188648757": {"Name": "Chang Y.M.", "AuthorID": "57188648757", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Research Support Office, Royal Veterinary College, Camden Campus"}, "57194855583": {"Name": "Efstathiou K.", "AuthorID": "57194855583", "AffiliationID": "60060583", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Therapeutics, General hospital of Athens \u2018Alexandra\u2019"}, "56366045200": {"Name": "Purcell R.", "AuthorID": "56366045200", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, Camden Campus"}, "56957712300": {"Name": "Peters L.M.", "AuthorID": "56957712300", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Pathogen Biology, Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Campus"}, "6507043621": {"Name": "Szladovits B.", "AuthorID": "6507043621", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Pathogen Biology, Royal Veterinary College, Hawkshead Campus"}, "6701556011": {"Name": "Turmaine M.", "AuthorID": "6701556011", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biosciences, University College London"}}}
