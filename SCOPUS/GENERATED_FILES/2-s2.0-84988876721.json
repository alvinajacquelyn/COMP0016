Very little is known about the cause for nocturia. The aim of this work was to evaluate lower urinary tract (LUT) symptoms in patients with PD reporting nocturia using standardized validated questionnaires and bladder diaries and to assess the impact of nocturia on quality of life and sleep. Methods: Twenty-three consecutive patients with PD (17 males, 6 females; mean age: 68.5 years; range, 50-85) referred to a specialist uro-neurology clinic reporting nocturia according to the International Continence Society definition were included. Patients measured their daily fluid intake, urinary output per void, and recorded these with the timing of voids on a 3-day bladder diary. Standardized questionnaires were used to assess LUT symptoms (Urinary Symptom Profile, International Prostate Symptom Score, and Qualiveen Short Form) and sleep quality (Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale). Results: Mean duration of PD was 10.1 years, and mean severity on H & Y scale was 3.0 (range, 1.0-5.0). Median duration of LUT symptoms was 6.0 years. Mean night-time urinary frequency was 3.5 (range, 1.0-7.3), and mean nocturnal maximum voided volume was 242 mL. Mean Nocturnal Polyuria Index (NPi) was 0.4 (range, 0.13-0.75), and 13 patients (56.5%) had nocturnal polyuria (NPi > 0.33). Patients with nocturnal polyuria reported more-severe LUT symptoms that impacted quality of life and sleep. Conclusions: In this preliminary study, nocturnal polyuria seems to be common in patients with PD reporting nocturia and appears to affect quality of life and sleep, though this was not statistically significant. The bladder diary is an essential tool in the assessment of nocturia in patients with PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Nocturia", "Nocturnal polyuria", "Parkinson's disease", "Sleep"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988876721", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57209613143": {"Name": "Smith M.", "AuthorID": "57209613143", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "46062438500": {"Name": "Seth J.", "AuthorID": "46062438500", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56879006800": {"Name": "Hofereiter J.", "AuthorID": "56879006800", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "8862148900": {"Name": "Panicker J.N.", "AuthorID": "8862148900", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Uro-Neurology, The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "36450181000": {"Name": "Batla A.", "AuthorID": "36450181000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
