The resulting In2O3-sensitizing ZnO nanorod arrays not only exhibited enhanced photoelectrochemical activity for water splitting under visible-light irradiation, but also possessed anti-photocorrosion property. The photo-induced charge-transfer property of In2O3 could be improved greatly by coupling with ZnO. This observation demonstrated that the heterojunction at the interface between In2O3 and ZnO could efficiently reduce the recombination of photo-induced electron\u2013hole pairs and increase the lifetime of charge carriers and therefore enhance the photo-to-current efficiency of the In2O3\u2013ZnO nanocrystalline arrays. It reveals that the heterojunction construction between two different semiconductors plays a very important role in determining the dynamic properties of their photogenerated charge carriers and their photo-to-current conversion efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["In2O3 quantum dots", "Photoelectrochemical water splitting", "Thin-film photoanode", "ZnO nanorod array"], "IndexKeywords": ["Current conversion efficiency", "Photo-anodes", "Photoelectrochemical water splitting", "Photoelectrochemicals", "Photogenerated charge carriers", "Photoinduced charge transfer", "Visible-light irradiation", "ZnO nanorod arrays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946556833", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56070138100": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "56070138100", "AffiliationID": "60030434", "AffiliationName": "Qingdao University"}, "57211093230": {"Name": "Li C.", "AuthorID": "57211093230", "AffiliationID": "60022422", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Oceanology University of China"}, "56754790700": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "56754790700", "AffiliationID": "60030434", "AffiliationName": "Qingdao University"}, "56069770100": {"Name": "Sun K.", "AuthorID": "56069770100", "AffiliationID": "60030434", "AffiliationName": "Qingdao University"}, "7405527222": {"Name": "Yu J.", "AuthorID": "7405527222", "AffiliationID": "60011549, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Clean Energy Chemistry & Materials, Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics, CAS"}, "53880326000": {"Name": "Nie M.", "AuthorID": "53880326000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Advanced Tribology at Southampton, School of Engineering Sciences, University of Southampton"}}}
