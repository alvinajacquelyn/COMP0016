In this work, we use a pseudo-bilayer system made of poly(2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (PBTTT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), to acquire a more complete understanding of the diffusion and intercalation of the fullerene-derivative within the polymer layer. By exploiting morphological and structural characterisation techniques, we observe that if we increase the film solidification time the polymer develops a higher crystalline order, and, as a result, it does not allow fullerene molecules to intercalate between the polymer side-chains. Gaining insight into the detailed fullerene intercalation mechanism is important for the development of organic photovoltaic diodes (PVDs).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989869885", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55914397200": {"Name": "Patern\u00f2 G.M.", "AuthorID": "55914397200", "AffiliationID": "60023256", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Italiano di Tecbologia, Center for Nano Science and Technology at Polimi"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "15924169200": {"Name": "Skoda M.W.A.", "AuthorID": "15924169200", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7003744251": {"Name": "Dalgliesh R.", "AuthorID": "7003744251", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "11539776500": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda Sakai V.", "AuthorID": "11539776500", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
