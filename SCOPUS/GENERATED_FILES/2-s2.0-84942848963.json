Published by Elsevier Inc.Homeostatic plasticity is thought to stabilize neural activity around a set point within a physiologically reasonable dynamic range. Over the last ten years, a wide range of non-invasive transcranial brain stimulation (NTBS) techniques have been used to probe homeostatic control of cortical plasticity in the intact human brain. Here, we review different NTBS approaches to study homeostatic plasticity on a systems level and relate the findings to both, physiological evidence from in vitro studies and to a theoretical framework of homeostatic function. We highlight differences between homeostatic and other non-homeostatic forms of plasticity and we examine the contribution of sleep in restoring synaptic homeostasis. Finally, we discuss the growing number of studies showing that abnormal homeostatic plasticity may be associated to a range of neuropsychiatric diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Homeostatic plasticity", "Long-term inhibition", "Long-term potentiation", "Metaplasticity", "Non-invasive transcranial brain stimulation", "Synaptic homeostasis hypothesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Cerebral Cortex", "Consensus", "Homeostasis", "Humans", "Motor Cortex", "Nerve Net", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942848963", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24169033900": {"Name": "Karabanov A.", "AuthorID": "24169033900", "AffiliationID": "60002327", "AffiliationName": "Danish Research Center for Magnetic Resonance, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, Kettegaard Alle 30"}, "7006199870": {"Name": "Siebner H.R.", "AuthorID": "7006199870", "AffiliationID": "60025840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Copenhagen University Hospital Bispebjerg"}, "56030522100": {"Name": "Ziemann U.", "AuthorID": "56030522100", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Stroke, Hertie-Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of T\u00fcbingen"}, "35291923000": {"Name": "Hamada M.", "AuthorID": "35291923000", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56752276600": {"Name": "George M.S.", "AuthorID": "56752276600", "AffiliationID": "60001421", "AffiliationName": "Ralph H.
