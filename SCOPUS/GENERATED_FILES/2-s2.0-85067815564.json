Proposed methods were evaluated with a data set containing electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BP), and PPG signals from 17 healthy subjects during a tilt table test. The methods are based on a surrogate of \u03b1 index, which is defined as the power ratio of RR interval variability (RRV) and that of systolic arterial pressure series variability (SAPV). The proposed \u03b1 index surrogates use pulse-to-pulse interval series variability (PPV) as a surrogate of RRV, and different morphological features of the PPG pulse which have been hypothesized to be related to BP, as series surrogates of SAPV. A time-frequency technique was used to assess BRS, taking into account the non-stationarity of the protocol. This technique identifies two time-varying frequency bands where RRV and SAPV (or their surrogates) are expected to be coupled: the low frequency (LF, inside 0.04\u20130.15 Hz range), and the high frequency (HF, inside 0.15\u20130.4 Hz range) bands. Furthermore, time-frequency coherence is used to identify the time intervals when the RRV and SAPV (or their surrogates) are coupled. Conventional \u03b1 index based on RRV and SAPV was used as Gold Standard. Spearman correlation coefficients between conventional \u03b1 index and its PPG-based surrogates were computed and the paired Wilcoxon statistical test was applied in order to assess whether the indices can find significant differences (p < 0.05) between different stages of the protocol. The highest correlations with the conventional \u03b1 index were obtained by the \u03b1-index-surrogate based on PPV and pulse up-slope (PUS), with 0.74 for LF band, and 0.81 for HF band. Furthermore, this index found significant differences between rest stages and tilt stage in both LF and HF bands according to the paired Wilcoxon test, as the conventional \u03b1 index also did. These results suggest that BRS changes induced by the tilt test can be assessed with high correlation by only a PPG signal using PPV as RRV surrogate, and PPG morphological features as SAPV surrogates, being PUS the most convenient SAPV surrogate among the studied ones.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alpha index", "Autonomic nervous system", "Baroreflex", "Blood pressure", "Cardiovascular assessment", "Photoplethysmography"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067815564", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56488383200": {"Name": "L\u00e1zaro J.", "AuthorID": "56488383200", "AffiliationID": "60085101", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Bioingenier\u00eda, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN)"}, "23389325500": {"Name": "Gil E.", "AuthorID": "23389325500", "AffiliationID": "60085101", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Bioingenier\u00eda, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN)"}, "56216881700": {"Name": "Laguna P.", "AuthorID": "56216881700", "AffiliationID": "60085101", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Bioingenier\u00eda, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN)"}, "57216533861": {"Name": "Bail\u00f3n R.", "AuthorID": "57216533861", "AffiliationID": "60085101", "AffiliationName": "Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Biom\u00e9dica en Red en Bioingenier\u00eda, Biomateriales y Nanomedicina (CIBER-BBN)"}, "26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
