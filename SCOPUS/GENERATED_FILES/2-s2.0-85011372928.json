While plaque and tangle accumulation likely contributes to neuron and synapse loss, disease-related changes to oligodendrocytes andmyelin are also suspected of playing a role in development of AD dementia. Still, to our knowledge, little is known about AD-relatedmyelin changes, and even when present, they are often regarded as secondary to concomitant arteriosclerosis or related to aging. OBJECTIVE To assess associations between hallmark AD pathology and novel quantitative neuroimaging markers while being sensitive to white mattermyelin content. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Magnetic resonance imagingwas performed at an academic research neuroimaging center on a cohort of 71 cognitively asymptomatic adults enriched for AD risk. Lumbar punctures were performed and assayed for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD pathology, including \u03b2-amyloid 42, total tau protein, phosphorylated tau 181, and soluble amyloid precursor protein.We measured whole-brain longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates as well as themyelin water fraction from each of these individuals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Automated brain mapping algorithms and statistical models were used to evaluate the relationships between age, CSF biomarkers of AD pathology, and quantitativemagnetic resonance imaging relaxometry measures, including the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates and themyelin water fraction. RESULTS The mean (SD) age for the 19 male participants and 52 female participants in the study was 61.6 (6.4) years. Widespread age-related changes tomyelin were observed across the brain, particularly in latemyelinating brain regions such as frontal white matter and the genu of the corpus callosum. Quantitative relaxometry measures were negatively associated with levels of CSF biomarkers across brain white matter and in areas preferentially affected in AD. Furthermore, significant age-by-biomarker interactions were observed betweenmyelin water fraction and phosphorylated tau 181/\u03b2-amyloid 42, suggesting that phosphorylated tau 181/\u03b2-amyloid 42 levels modulate age-related changes inmyelin water fraction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest amyloid pathologies significantly influence white matter and that these abnormalitiesmay signify an early feature of the disease process.We expect that clarifying the nature ofmyelin damage in preclinical AD may be informative on the disease's course and lead to new markers of efficacy for prevention and treatment trials.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Apolipoproteins E", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myelin Sheath", "Peptide Fragments", "Phosphorylation", "Plaque, Amyloid", "Statistics as Topic", "tau Proteins", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011372928", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57208075525": {"Name": "Dean D.C.", "AuthorID": "57208075525", "AffiliationID": "60014455, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "23970407600": {"Name": "Kecskemeti S.R.", "AuthorID": "23970407600", "AffiliationID": "60014455, 60032179", "AffiliationName": "Waisman Center, University of Wisconsin-Madison"}, "7201740215": {"Name": "Alexander A.L.", "AuthorID": "7201740215", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "36604517700": {"Name": "Hurley S.A.", "AuthorID": "36604517700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain, University of Oxford"}, "57193164328": {"Name": "O'Grady J.P.", "AuthorID": "57193164328", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Disease Research Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "57193167683": {"Name": "Canda C.", "AuthorID": "57193167683", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Wisconsin Alzheimer Institute, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "56669859400": {"Name": "Davenport-Sis N.J.", "AuthorID": "56669859400", "AffiliationID": "60025553", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Disease Research Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health"}, "7103143605": {"Name": "Carlsson C.M.", "AuthorID": "7103143605", "AffiliationID": "60073942", "AffiliationName": "Geriatric Research Education and Clinical Center, William S.
