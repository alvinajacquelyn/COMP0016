Yet within cohorts, variations in timing and sequencing of events still remain. A major determinant of life course differences is social class. This characteristic can influence the sequence of events in terms of socioeconomic inequalities through a different availability of opportunities for social mobility. Several studies show that in North America, a higher familial status tends to decrease the complexity of trajectories, while the opposite effect has been found in Southern Europe. This research examines the sequence of transitions, highlighting in a comparative perspective how life trajectories are influenced by parental social class in the United States and Italy. The main result of the analysis is that the effect of parental status is in fact different across countries, however in an unforeseen way based on what the literature on the topic has found so far.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Italy", "Life course", "Sequence analysis", "Social class", "Transition to adulthood", "United States"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016155526", "SubjectAreas": [["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"37665949300": {"Name": "Sironi M.", "AuthorID": "37665949300", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Quantitative Social Science, UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}, "36068838900": {"Name": "Barban N.", "AuthorID": "36068838900", "AffiliationID": "60010018, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology & Nuffield College, University of Oxford"}, "53363699700": {"Name": "Impicciatore R.", "AuthorID": "53363699700", "AffiliationID": "60028218", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Sciences University of Bologna via delle Belle Arti"}}}
