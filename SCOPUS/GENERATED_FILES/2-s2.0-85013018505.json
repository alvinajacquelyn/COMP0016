The material quality is assessed with a range of characterization tools showing low surface roughness and low density of threading dislocations. These results indicate a significant improvement on crystal quality compared to structures grown on InP substrates by using metamorphic buffers. Quantum efficiency and responsivity measurements show good performance of the fabricated devices between 1.5 and 2.5 \u00b5m, making them highly suitable for short-wavelength infrared applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Epitaxy", "Infrared", "Interfacial misfit array", "Photodiodes", "Short-wavelength"], "IndexKeywords": ["Characterization tools", "Interfacial misfit arrays", "Low surface roughness", "Metamorphic buffers", "Responsivity measurements", "Short wavelengths", "Short-wavelength infrared", "Threading dislocation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013018505", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56897244300": {"Name": "Jurczak P.", "AuthorID": "56897244300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "15765485000": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "15765485000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "10141185300": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "10141185300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "14054731500": {"Name": "Sablon K.", "AuthorID": "14054731500", "AffiliationID": "60033252", "AffiliationName": "United States Army Research Laboratory"}, "35240020700": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez M.", "AuthorID": "35240020700", "AffiliationID": "60016476", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science and Metallurgic Engineering, The University of Cadiz"}}}
