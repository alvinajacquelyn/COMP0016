Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.Aims To determine how native myocardial T1 and extracellular volume (ECV) change with age, both to understand aging and to inform on normal reference ranges. Methods and results Ninety-four healthy volunteers with no a history or symptoms of cardiovascular disease or diabetes underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance at 1.5 T. Mid-ventricular short axis native and post-contrast T1 maps by Shortened MOdified Look-Locker Inversion-recovery (ShMOLLI), MOdified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) [pre-contrast: 5s(3s)3s, post-contrast: 4s(1s)3s(1s)2s] and saturation recovery single-shot acquisition (SASHA) were acquired and ECV by these three techniques were derived for the mid anteroseptum. Mean age was 50 \u00b1 14 years (range 20-76), male 52%, with no age difference between genders (males 51 \u00b1 14 years; females 49 \u00b1 15 years, P = 0.55). Quoting respectively ShMOLLI, MOLLI, SASHA throughout, mean myocardial T1 was 957 \u00b1 30 ms, 1025 \u00b1 38 ms, 1144 \u00b1 45 ms (P < 0.0001) and ECV 28.4 \u00b1 3.0% [95% confidence interval (CI) 27.8-29.0], 27.3 \u00b1 2.7 (95% CI 26.8-27.9), 24.1 \u00b1 2.9% (95% CI 23.5-24.7) (P < 0.0001), with all values higher in females for all techniques (T1 +18 ms, +35 ms, +51 ms; ECV +2.7%, +2.6%, +3.4%). Native myocardial T1 reduced slightly with age (R 2 = 0.042, P = 0.048; R 2 = 0.131, P < 0.0001-on average by 8-11 ms/decade-but not for SASHA (R 2 = 0.033 and P = 0.083). ECV did not change with age (R 2 = 0.003, P = 0.582; R 2 = 0.002, P = 0.689; R 2 = 0.003, P = 0.615). Heart rate decreased slightly with age (R 2 = 0.075, coefficient = \u00e2 '0.273, P = 0.008), but there was no relationship between age and other blood T1 influences (haematocrit, iron, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol). Conclusion Gender influences native T1 and ECV with women having a higher native T1 and ECV. Native T1 measured by MOLLI and ShMOLLI was slightly lower with increasing age but not with SASHA and ECV was independent of age for all techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["age", "extracellular volume", "gender", "healthy volunteers", "myocardial T1", "T1 mapping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aging", "Body Surface Potential Mapping", "Confidence Intervals", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Healthy Aging", "Heart", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048204072", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"35620856500": {"Name": "Rosmini S.", "AuthorID": "35620856500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "53981151600": {"Name": "Bulluck H.", "AuthorID": "53981151600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College, West Smithfield"}, "6506837383": {"Name": "Captur G.", "AuthorID": "6506837383", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "15754511800": {"Name": "Treibel T.A.", "AuthorID": "15754511800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "56528300800": {"Name": "Abdel-Gadir A.", "AuthorID": "56528300800", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "34970790200": {"Name": "Bhuva A.N.", "AuthorID": "34970790200", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57191619729": {"Name": "Culotta V.", "AuthorID": "57191619729", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "26534328000": {"Name": "Herrey A.S.", "AuthorID": "26534328000", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "6504025861": {"Name": "Manisty C.", "AuthorID": "6504025861", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57202314649": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "57202314649", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College, West Smithfield"}, "15841850200": {"Name": "Merghani A.", "AuthorID": "15841850200", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, St Georges, University of London"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55355501300": {"Name": "Maestrini V.", "AuthorID": "55355501300", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular, Respiratory Nephrology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57203181718": {"Name": "Chow K.", "AuthorID": "57203181718", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta"}, "55364294200": {"Name": "Thompson R.B.", "AuthorID": "55364294200", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta"}, "7004664392": {"Name": "Piechnik S.K.", "AuthorID": "7004664392", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7004851504": {"Name": "Kellman P.", "AuthorID": "7004851504", "AffiliationID": "60006577", "AffiliationName": "National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health"}}}
