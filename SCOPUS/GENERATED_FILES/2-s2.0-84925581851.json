A variety of other disease manifestations may also be present, including general constitutional symptoms and extraglandular features. A multidisciplinary approach focused on both local and systemic medical therapies is needed as the disease has a wide clinical spectrum. The current treatment for SS is mainly symptomatic. However, there is evidence that systemic drugs are effective in controlling extraglandular manifestations of the disease. Overall evidence for the role of conventional immunosuppressive therapy is limited. A number of attempts to use biologic therapies have led to variable results. Biologic agents targeting B cells, such as rituximab, epratuzumab and belimumab, have shown promising results, but further studies are needed to validate the findings. Early-phase studies with abatacept and alefacept proved that T cell stimulation inhibition is another potentially effective target for SS treatment. Modulation or inhibition of other targets such as IFN, IL-6 and Toll-like receptor are also currently being investigated. We have summarized the available evidence regarding the efficacy of biologic treatments and discuss other potential therapies targeting pathways or molecules recognized as being involved in the pathogenesis of SS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abatacept", "B cell-targeted therapy", "Belimumab", "Biologic therapies", "Epratuzumab", "Interferon", "Rituximab", "Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome", "T cell modulation therapy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Animals", "Antibodies, Monoclonal", "Antirheumatic Agents", "B-Cell Activating Factor", "Biological Factors", "Biological Products", "Biological Therapy", "Cytokines", "Epidemiologic Methods", "Humans", "Mice", "Molecular Targeted Therapy", "Sjogren's Syndrome", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925581851", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"56571425800": {"Name": "Sada P.", "AuthorID": "56571425800", "AffiliationID": "60015927", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Universitario de Basurto, Departamento de Medicina Interna"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "116710095", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology Research, Division of Medicine"}, "15021974200": {"Name": "Ciurtin C.", "AuthorID": "15021974200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College"}}}
