All rights reserved.Pseudocapacitive materials that store charges by fast redox reactions are promising candidates for designing high energy density electrochemical capacitors. MXenes - recently discovered two-dimensional carbides, have shown excellent capacitance in aqueous electrolytes, but in a narrow potential window, which limits both the energy and power density. Here, we investigated the electrochemical behavior of Ti3C2 MXene in 1M solution of 1-ethly-3-methylimidazolium bis- (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (EMITFSI) in acetonitrile and two other common organic electrolytes. This paper describes the use of clay, delaminated and composite Ti3C2 electrodes with carbon nanotubes in order to understand the effect of the electrode architecture and composition on the electrochemical performance. Capacitance values of 85 F g-1 and 245 F cm-3 were obtained at 2 mV s-1, with a high rate capability and good cyclability. In situ X-ray diffraction study reveals the intercalation of large EMI+ cations into MXene, which leads to increased capacitance, but may also be the rate limiting factor that determines the device performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon nanotube, titanium carbide", "Electrochemical capacitors", "MXene", "Two-dimensional materials", "X-ray diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrochemical behaviors", "Electrochemical capacitor", "Electrochemical performance", "Electrode architecture", "In-situ X-ray diffraction", "MXene", "Pseudo-capacitive materials", "Two-dimensional materials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84950996011", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55700195700": {"Name": "Dall'Agnese Y.", "AuthorID": "55700195700", "AffiliationID": "60014662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering, A.
