Occipital nerve stimulation has been investigated as a potentially effective treatment for refractory chronic migraine. Results from randomised controlled trials and open label studies have been inconclusive with little long-term data available. Methods: The long-term efficacy, functional outcome and safety of occipital nerve stimulation was evaluated in an uncontrolled, open-label, prospective study of 53 intractable chronic migraine patients. Results: Fifty-three patients were implanted in a single centre between 2007 and 2013. Patients had a mean age of 47.75 years (range 26\u201370), had suffered chronic migraine for around 12 years and had failed a mean of 9 (range 4\u201319) preventative treatments prior to implant. Eighteen patients had other chronic headache phenotypes in addition to chronic migraine. After a median follow-up of 42.00 months (range 6\u201397) monthly moderate-to-severe headache days (i.e. days on which pain was more than 4 on the verbal rating score and lasted at least 4 h) reduced by 8.51 days (p < 0.001) in the whole cohort, 5.80 days (p < 0.01) in those with chronic migraine alone and 12.16 days (p < 0.001) in those with multiple phenotypes including chronic migraine. Response rate of the whole group (defined as a >30 % reduction in monthly moderate-to-severe headache days) was observed in 45.3 % of the whole cohort, 34.3 % of those with chronic migraine alone and 66.7 % in those with multiple headache types. Mean subjective patient estimate of improvement was 31.7 %. Significant reductions were also seen in outcome measures such as pain intensity (1.34 points, p < 0.001), all monthly headache days (5.66 days, p < 0.001) and pain duration (4.54 h, p < 0.001). Responders showed substantial reductions in headache-related disability, affect scores and quality of life measures. Adverse event rates were favourable with no episodes of lead migration and only one minor infection reported. Conclusions: Occipital nerve stimulation may be a safe and efficacious treatment for highly intractable chronic migraine patients even after relatively prolonged follow up of a median of over 3 years.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic migraine", "Headache", "Neurostimulation", "Occipital nerve stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Headache Disorders", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Migraine Disorders", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Spinal Nerves", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981249429", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"36544229100": {"Name": "Miller S.", "AuthorID": "36544229100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Headache Group, Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6701699175": {"Name": "Matharu M.", "AuthorID": "6701699175", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Headache Group, Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7102438957": {"Name": "Watkins L.", "AuthorID": "7102438957", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}}}
