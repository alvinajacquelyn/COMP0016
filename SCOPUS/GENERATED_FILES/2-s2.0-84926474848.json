The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.Solar coronal plasma composition is typically characterized by first ionization potential (FIP) bias. Using spectra obtained by Hinode's EUV Imaging Spectrometer instrument, we present a series of large-scale, spatially resolved composition maps of active region (AR)11389. The composition maps show how FIP bias evolves within the decaying AR during the period 2012 January 4-6. Globally, FIP bias decreases throughout the AR. We analyzed areas of significant plasma composition changes within the decaying AR and found that small-scale evolution in the photospheric magnetic field is closely linked to the FIP bias evolution observed in the corona. During the AR's decay phase, small bipoles emerging within supergranular cells reconnect with the pre-existing AR field, creating a pathway along which photospheric and coronal plasmas can mix. The mixing timescales are shorter than those of plasma enrichment processes. Eruptive activity also results in shifting the FIP bias closer to photospheric in the affected areas. Finally, the FIP bias still remains dominantly coronal only in a part of the AR's high-flux density core. We conclude that in the decay phase of an AR's lifetime, the FIP bias is becoming increasingly modulated by episodes of small-scale flux emergence, i.e., decreasing the AR's overall FIP bias. Our results show that magnetic field evolution plays an important role in compositional changes during AR development, revealing a more complex relationship than expected from previous well-known Skylab results showing that FIP bias increases almost linearly with age in young ARs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Solar wind", "Sun: Abundances", "Sun: Activity"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926474848", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55449579800": {"Name": "Baker D.", "AuthorID": "55449579800", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "56584197500": {"Name": "Yardley S.L.", "AuthorID": "56584197500", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "7005109977": {"Name": "Van Driel-Gesztelyi L.", "AuthorID": "7005109977", "AffiliationID": "60027811, 60004114", "AffiliationName": "Konkoly Observatory, Hungarian Academy of Sciences"}, "57211231301": {"Name": "Long D.M.", "AuthorID": "57211231301", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "7401917508": {"Name": "Green L.M.", "AuthorID": "7401917508", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Mullard Space Science Laboratory"}, "57220851521": {"Name": "Brooks D.H.", "AuthorID": "57220851521", "AffiliationID": "60018319", "AffiliationName": "College of Science, George Mason University"}, "7004530611": {"Name": "D\u00e9moulin P.", "AuthorID": "7004530611", "AffiliationID": "60031186, 60028894, 60001422", "AffiliationName": "Observatoire de Paris, LESIA, UPMC Univ.
