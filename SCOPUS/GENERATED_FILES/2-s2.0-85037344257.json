Next, we find that this OJT gap is positively correlated with gaps in the literacy and numeracy scores achieved by these two types of workers in the PIAAC study. Although we choose Spain as a case study of a dual labor market, we also provide cross-country evidence showing that OJT gaps are lower in those European labor markets where dualism is less entrenched than in those where it is more extended.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive skills", "Dual labor market", "On-the-job training", "Severance pay"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037344257", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"6602192383": {"Name": "Cabrales A.", "AuthorID": "6602192383", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7004284966": {"Name": "Dolado J.", "AuthorID": "7004284966", "AffiliationID": "60024316", "AffiliationName": "European University Institute"}, "36834979600": {"Name": "Mora R.", "AuthorID": "36834979600", "AffiliationID": "60001741", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Carlos III Madrid"}}}
