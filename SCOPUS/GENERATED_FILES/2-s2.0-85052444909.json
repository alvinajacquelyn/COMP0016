The reaction is studied at a series of fixed surface temperatures between 14 and 100 K. After dosing the reactants on to the surface, temperature-programmed desorption, coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry, reveals the formation of a product with themolecular formula C3H3NO. This product results from the addition of a single oxygen atom to the acrylonitrile reactant. The oxygen atom attack appears to occur exclusively at the C=C double bond, rather than involving the cyano(-CN) group. The absence of reactivity at the cyano site hints that full saturation of organic molecules on dust grains may not always occur in the interstellar medium. Modelling the experimental data provides a reaction probability of 0.007 \u00b1 0.003 for a Langmuir-Hinshelwood style (diffusive) reaction mechanism. Desorption energies for acrylonitrile, oxygen atoms, and molecular oxygen, from the multilayer mixed ice their deposition forms, are also extracted from the kinetic model and are 22.7 \u00b1 1.0 kJ mol-1 (2730 \u00b1 120 K), 14.2 \u00b1 1.0 kJ mol-1 (1710 \u00b1 120 K), and 8.5 \u00b1 0.8 kJ mol-1 (1020 \u00b1 100 K), respectively. The kinetic parameters we extract from our experiments indicate that the reaction between atomic oxygen and acrylonitrile could occur on interstellar dust grains on an astrophysical time-scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astrochemistry", "ISM: abundances", "ISM: molecules", "Stars: formation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052444909", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55681220600": {"Name": "Kimber H.J.", "AuthorID": "55681220600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, University College London"}, "57188878798": {"Name": "Toscano J.", "AuthorID": "57188878798", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, University College London"}, "7202475351": {"Name": "Price S.D.", "AuthorID": "7202475351", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, University College London"}}}
