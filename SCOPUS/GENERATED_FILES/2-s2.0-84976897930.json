DMC with the fixed-node approximation relies on modifications of the Green's function to avoid singularities near the nodal surface of the trial wave function. Here we show that these modifications affect the DMC energies in a way that is not size consistent, resulting in large time-step errors. Building on the modifications of Umrigar et al. and DePasquale et al. we propose a simple Green's function modification that restores size consistency to large values of the time step, which substantially reduces time-step errors. This algorithm also yields remarkable speedups of up to two orders of magnitude in the calculation of molecule-molecule binding energies and crystal cohesive energies, thus extending the horizons of what is possible with DMC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976897930", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"24172289000": {"Name": "Zen A.", "AuthorID": "24172289000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "22970836100": {"Name": "Gillan M.J.", "AuthorID": "22970836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004035504": {"Name": "Alf\u00e8 D.", "AuthorID": "7004035504", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "35567243200": {"Name": "Sorella S.", "AuthorID": "35567243200", "AffiliationID": "60083084", "AffiliationName": "INFM Democritos National Simulation Center"}}}
