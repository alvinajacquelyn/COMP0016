This paper describes a two-level parcel distribution model that combines walking and driving for a single driver. The model aims to minimise the total travelling time by scheduling a vehicle\u2019s routing and the driver\u2019s walking sequence when making deliveries, taking decisions on parking locations into consideration. The model is a variant of the Clustered Travelling Salesman Problem with Time Windows, in which the sequence of visits within each cluster is required to form a closed tour. When applied to a case study of an actual vehicle round from a parcel carrier operating in London, savings of over 20% in the total operation time were returned over the current situation where 144 parcels were being delivered to 57 delivery locations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clustered travelling salesman problem", "last-mile delivery", "time windows"], "IndexKeywords": ["Current situation", "Distribution models", "Efficient strategy", "Last mile", "Parcel delivery", "Parking locations", "Time windows", "Travelling salesman problem"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057347502", "SubjectAreas": [["Management Information Systems", "BUSI", "1404"], ["Strategy and Management", "BUSI", "1408"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Marketing", "BUSI", "1406"]], "AuthorData": {"56798692100": {"Name": "Nguy\u00ea\u02dcn T.B.T.", "AuthorID": "56798692100", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60176937", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Business School, Centre for Operational Research, Management Science and Information Systems (CORMSIS), University of Southampton"}, "8968135100": {"Name": "Bekta\u015f T.", "AuthorID": "8968135100", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60176937", "AffiliationName": "Southampton Business School, Centre for Operational Research, Management Science and Information Systems (CORMSIS), University of Southampton"}, "6602474542": {"Name": "Cherrett T.J.", "AuthorID": "6602474542", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Southampton"}, "6603931446": {"Name": "McLeod F.N.", "AuthorID": "6603931446", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering and Environment, University of Southampton"}, "7406422527": {"Name": "Allen J.", "AuthorID": "7406422527", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, University of Westminster"}, "56069227200": {"Name": "Piotrowska M.", "AuthorID": "56069227200", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, University of Westminster"}, "35070344100": {"Name": "Piecyk M.", "AuthorID": "35070344100", "AffiliationID": "60000508", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Architecture and the Built Environment, University of Westminster"}, "55153170400": {"Name": "Bates O.", "AuthorID": "55153170400", "AffiliationID": "60117772, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University"}, "7003555568": {"Name": "Friday A.", "AuthorID": "7003555568", "AffiliationID": "60117772, 60023643", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University"}, "57197263285": {"Name": "Wise S.", "AuthorID": "57197263285", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of the Built Environment, University College London"}}}
