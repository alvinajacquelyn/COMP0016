One specific Raman technique, UV resonance Raman (UVRR) spectroscopy, has potential as a probe for residual cellular DNA and RNA in mammalian cell culture medium. RESULTS: Variations in DNA and RNA UVRR spectral profiles of medium-cellular footprint samples were identified and related to time of harvest and increased cell lysis that is associated with a loss in cell viability. Increased DNA and RNA were also observed in the cell culture supernatant in response to sodium butyrate treatment. Variation in DNA and RNA profiles as a result of both primary and secondary clarification methods during downstream bioprocessing could also be determined with UVRR spectroscopy. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated the utility of UVRR spectroscopy as a tool to monitor variations in residual DNA and RNA that may contaminate cell culture medium. Application of this technique has the potential for both improvement of recovery techniques and assurance of reliable clearance of DNA/RNA to acceptable safety levels.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cellular DNA", "Clarification", "Mammalian cell culture", "Sodium butyrate", "UV resonance Raman"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell culture mediums", "Mammalian cell culture", "Mammalian cell lines", "Process analytical tool", "Recovery techniques", "Sodium butyrate", "UV resonance Raman", "UV-resonance Raman spectroscopy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920914663", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"8341036300": {"Name": "Ashton L.", "AuthorID": "8341036300", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, University of Manchester"}, "7006231733": {"Name": "Goodacre R.", "AuthorID": "7006231733", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, University of Manchester"}, "54583572300": {"Name": "Hogwood C.", "AuthorID": "54583572300", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Center for Molecular Processing and School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "57189230870": {"Name": "Smales C.", "AuthorID": "57189230870", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "Center for Molecular Processing and School of Biosciences, University of Kent"}, "57197493903": {"Name": "Tait A.", "AuthorID": "57197493903", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602592324": {"Name": "Bracewell D.", "AuthorID": "6602592324", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, Department of Biochemical Engineering, University College London"}, "23492474900": {"Name": "Kuligowski J.", "AuthorID": "23492474900", "AffiliationID": "60105312", "AffiliationName": "Neonatal Research Group, Health Research Institute Hospital La Fe"}, "57208543394": {"Name": "Dickson A.", "AuthorID": "57208543394", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester"}}}
