We present an updated analysis of degree outcomes in UK geography for 2010\u20132016 showing a strong correlation between average A-level points score on entry and the proportion of good degrees awarded by UK geography departments. We then go on to report on the results of pilot training activities within the discipline to increase the use of social calibration techniques as a means of providing transparent assurance about the high quality of assessment practices. We conclude that there is good reason to engage positively and actively with the public debate about academic standards and we make the case for regular social calibration exercises to share marking practices across multiple institutions as a potential means of ensuring consistency, reliability and clarity in academic standards.", "AuthorKeywords": ["academic standards", "assessment", "calibration", "degree outcomes", "grade inflation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070950600", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"55576222000": {"Name": "Wyse S.", "AuthorID": "55576222000", "AffiliationID": "60179133", "AffiliationName": "Royal Geographical Society (with IBG)"}, "7103258105": {"Name": "Page B.", "AuthorID": "7103258105", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and African Studies Research Centre, UCL"}, "15521466800": {"Name": "Walkington H.", "AuthorID": "15521466800", "AffiliationID": "60014564", "AffiliationName": "Department of Social Sciences, Oxford Brookes University"}, "55737886800": {"Name": "Hill J.L.", "AuthorID": "55737886800", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography and Environmental Management, University of the West of England"}}}
