Nowadays, Sorby's methods are still employed for near all inorganic materials with scarce modifications. The optical microscopy subject is essential for rocks analysis; it is an irreplaceable technique for specific complex samples, such as twinned-exsolved feldspars and it must be preserved in the geosciences curriculum. However, for many valuable and common specimens we observe a strong growing of non-destructive techniques coupled to the large chambers of modern microscopes including new chemical, molecular, luminescent, metrical, imaging and structural probes. Suitable explanations for the thin sections decreasing in research laboratories could be: (i) the undesirable cutting of the specimen; (ii) the contamination of surfaces by abrasives and glues; (iii) the etching with dangerous acids; (iv) the slow and painful works of cutting, grinding and polishing specimens; (v) the necessary protection of valuable specimens, (vi) the need for immediate analytical results.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984583414", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57204802462": {"Name": "Garcia-Guinea J.", "AuthorID": "57204802462", "AffiliationID": "60015098, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"}, "7102064094": {"Name": "Garrido F.", "AuthorID": "7102064094", "AffiliationID": "60015098, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"}, "55884156400": {"Name": "Lopez-Arce P.", "AuthorID": "55884156400", "AffiliationID": "60015098, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"}, "8967868400": {"Name": "Tormo L.", "AuthorID": "8967868400", "AffiliationID": "60015098, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"}, "24528573900": {"Name": "Jorge A.", "AuthorID": "24528573900", "AffiliationID": "60015098, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"}, "36915044900": {"Name": "Furio M.", "AuthorID": "36915044900", "AffiliationID": "60015098, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"}, "7801368436": {"Name": "Paradela C.", "AuthorID": "7801368436", "AffiliationID": "60015098, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Museo Nacional Ciencias Naturales (MNCN-CSIC)"}}}
