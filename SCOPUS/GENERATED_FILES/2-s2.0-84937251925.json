The purpose of this qualitative research study was to assess the content validity of the PDYS-26 in an independent sample and to use the findings to suggest a conceptual framework around the impact of PD-LID. Methods: PD patients experiencing LID and their caregivers were recruited from four US clinical sites. Stage I involved 22 qualitative concept elicitation interviews with patients and caregivers, and 11 qualitative cognitive interviews (CI) with patients about the PDYS-26. The PDYS-26 was modified based on Stage I findings. Stage II consisted of 13 CI on the Modified PDYS. Results: Forty-six participants were interviewed across both stages of the study. Patient mean age was 67.3 (SD \u00b1 9.55) years; 19 (54.3 %) female; 34 (97.1 %) white. The content validity of the PDYS-26 was generally supported. A revised conceptual framework with three hypothesized domains (body control, activities of daily living, social consequences) was developed. Modifications were made to the PDYS-26 (i.e., emphasizing LID in the instructions; response scale modification; deleting or modifying items), which resulted in the 22-item Modified PDYS. Conclusions: Stage I and II findings suggested a number of modifications to the scale in order to improve the content validity. Psychometric testing of the revised scale with a larger patient sample is suggested to evaluate item performance, establish scoring, and provide quantitative support for the conceptual framework.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Levodopa", "Levodopa-induced dyskinesia", "Parkinson\u2019s disease", "Patient-reported Outcomes", "Qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Caregivers", "Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced", "Female", "Humans", "Levodopa", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Parkinson Disease", "Psychometrics", "Qualitative Research", "Quality of Life", "Severity of Illness Index", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937251925", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"6603918125": {"Name": "Lenderking W.R.", "AuthorID": "6603918125", "AffiliationID": "60112053", "AffiliationName": "Evidera"}, "8859817500": {"Name": "Mannix S.", "AuthorID": "8859817500", "AffiliationID": "60112053", "AffiliationName": "Evidera"}, "56442573200": {"Name": "Landrian A.", "AuthorID": "56442573200", "AffiliationID": "60112053", "AffiliationName": "Evidera"}, "25929558300": {"Name": "Petrillo J.", "AuthorID": "25929558300", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Novartis AG"}, "35336682800": {"Name": "Kenney C.", "AuthorID": "35336682800", "AffiliationID": "60009968", "AffiliationName": "Formerly Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp."}, "55802371060": {"Name": "Schrag A.E.", "AuthorID": "55802371060", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
