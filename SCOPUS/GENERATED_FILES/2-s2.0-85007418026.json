Methods: Twenty-seven recreationally physically active males and females (n = 9 per treatment) were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: hydrolyzed beef protein, whey protein, or non-protein isoenergetic carbohydrate. Treatment consisted of ingesting 20 g of supplement, mixed with orange juice, once a day immediately post-workout or before breakfast on non-training days. Measurements were performed pre- and post-intervention on total load (kg) lifted at the first and last workout, body composition (via plethysmography) vastus medialis thickness (mm) (via ultrasonography), and blood indices of health. Salivary HNP1-3 were determined before and after performing the first and last workout. Results: Salivary concentration and secretion rates of the HNP1-3 decreased in the beef condition only from pre-first-workout (1.90 \u00b1 0.83 \u03bcg/mL; 2.95 \u00b1 2.83 \u03bcg/min, respectively) to pre-last-workout (0.92 \u00b1 0.63 \u03bcg/mL, p = 0.025, d = 1.03; 0.76 \u00b1 0.74 \u03bcg/min, p = 0.049, d = 0.95), and post-last-workout (0.95 \u00b1 0.60 \u03bcg/mL, p = 0.032, d = 1.00; 0.59 \u00b1 0.52 \u03bcg/min, p = 0.027, d = 1.02). No other significant differences between groups were observed. Conclusions: Supplementation with a carbohydrate\u2013protein beverage may support resistance training outcomes in a comparable way as the ingestion of only carbohydrate. Furthermore, the ingestion of 20 g of hydrolyzed beef protein resulted in a decreased level and secretion rates of the HNP1-3 from baseline with no negative effect on blood indices of health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood indices of health", "Body composition", "Immune status", "Muscle thickness", "Strength performance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Athletes", "Body Composition", "Carbohydrates", "Dietary Supplements", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Humans", "Immune System", "Male", "Muscle Strength", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Proteins", "Quadriceps Muscle", "Resistance Training", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007418026", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"35115289600": {"Name": "Naclerio F.", "AuthorID": "35115289600", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Sports Sciences, University of Greenwich"}, "56565148600": {"Name": "Ashrafi N.", "AuthorID": "56565148600", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Sports Sciences, University of Greenwich"}, "56565659200": {"Name": "Seijo M.", "AuthorID": "56565659200", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Sports Sciences, University of Greenwich"}, "36681399700": {"Name": "Nielsen B.", "AuthorID": "36681399700", "AffiliationID": "60021889", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life and Sports Sciences, University of Greenwich"}, "55780004100": {"Name": "Larumbe-Zabala E.", "AuthorID": "55780004100", "AffiliationID": "60032964", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Institute, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center"}, "23982056400": {"Name": "Allgrove J.", "AuthorID": "23982056400", "AffiliationID": "60033359", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science Engineering and Computing, Kingston University"}, "7003778626": {"Name": "Earnest C.", "AuthorID": "7003778626", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Exercise Science and Nutrition Laboratory, Texas A&M University"}}}
