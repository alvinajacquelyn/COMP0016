Current technology does not allow fast and accurate delineation of the ablation target. Noninvasive panoramic ECG-imaging (ECGI) offers the possibility of studying the interaction between arrhythmogenic substrate and earliest sites of activation during VT to improve ablation strategies. ECGI mapping (CardioInsight, Medtronic) was performed in 5 patients undergoing VT ablation. Ventricular pacing was delivered from the RV and three indices were measured at each ventricular site to map susceptibility to arrhythmia initiation: Re-entry vulnerability index (RVI), local dispersion of AT (\u0394AT) and local dispersion of repolarization (\u0394ARI). Regions of high susceptibility were defined as those corresponding to the bottom 5% of RV I and the upper 5% of \u0394AT and \u0394ARI. Morphologically distinct VTs were analyzed to measure the AT sequence and localize the region of earliest epicardial activation (AT < 5 ms). In total, 20 VTs were analyzed (4.0 \u00b1 1.2 per patient). The minimum distance between the region of high vulnerability and the region of earliest AT during VT was 5.6 \u00b1 8.6 mm for RV I, 6.1 \u00b1 10.8 mm for \u0394AT and 12.8 \u00b1 22.4 mm for \u0394ARI (P > 0.13 for all pair-wise comparison). The vulnerable region presented at least partial overlap with the region of earliest activation during VT in 50%, 55% and 50% of all VTs for RV I, \u0394AT and \u0394ARI, respectively. These early data confirm the mechanistic link between markers of arrhythmogenic risk and VT initiation and suggest that ECGI could be potentially used for targeting ablation in non-inducible or hemodynamically non-tolerated VTs.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Catheter ablation", "Current technology", "Mechanistic link", "Pair-wise comparison", "Ventricular pacing", "Ventricular tachycardia", "Vulnerability index", "Vulnerable regions"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068771058", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"26321773400": {"Name": "Orini M.", "AuthorID": "26321773400", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7006677172": {"Name": "Taggart P.", "AuthorID": "7006677172", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "6603130488": {"Name": "Lambiase P.D.", "AuthorID": "6603130488", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "57196246415": {"Name": "Graham A.", "AuthorID": "57196246415", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "10244786500": {"Name": "Dhinoja M.", "AuthorID": "10244786500", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "35078522400": {"Name": "Hunter R.", "AuthorID": "35078522400", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7201390233": {"Name": "Schilling R.J.", "AuthorID": "7201390233", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "16063029200": {"Name": "Chow A.W.", "AuthorID": "16063029200", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital"}}}
