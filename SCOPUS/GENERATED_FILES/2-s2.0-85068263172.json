The Dynamic Thickened Flame (DTF) model is extended to incorporate realistic chemical mechanisms to simulate the partially premixed flames due to flame impingement on a solid wall. A new chemical mechanism with 22 species 66 steps is developed for propane. This LES formulation correctly reproduces the different ignition and turbulent flame dynamics under three different ignition conditions corresponding to experiments. Combustion modes formed by the impinging propane flame are investigated using the flame indicator and chemical explosive modes analysis, which reveals the existence of both turbulent premixed and diffusion flames. The extent and strength of premixed and diffusion flame modes, respectively, are strongly influenced by the ignition location relative to the wall. The corresponding thermal expansion leads to different flow and mixing processes, which in turn affects the subsequent flame development. The variation of the overall heat release with time is different for the three ignition locations, reflecting different contributions from the premixed and diffusion flames, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chemical explosive mode analysis (CEMA)", "Ignition and propagation", "Impinging flame", "Large eddy simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical explosive", "Chemical mechanism", "Flame propagation", "Ignition conditions", "Impinging flame", "Mode analysis", "Partially premixed flames", "Turbulent premixed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068263172", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57196264830": {"Name": "Chen Y.", "AuthorID": "57196264830", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "55208470000": {"Name": "Yao T.", "AuthorID": "55208470000", "AffiliationID": "60025278, 60123068", "AffiliationName": "Center for Combustion Energy, Key Laboratory for Thermal Science and Power Engineering of Ministry of Education, Department of Thermal Engineering, Tsinghua University"}, "57206919276": {"Name": "Wang Q.", "AuthorID": "57206919276", "AffiliationID": "60025084", "AffiliationName": "School of Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "7102436109": {"Name": "Luo K.H.", "AuthorID": "7102436109", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
