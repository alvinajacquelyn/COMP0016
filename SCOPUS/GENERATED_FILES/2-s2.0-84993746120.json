This article re-appraises the arguments put forward in \u2018Interviewing women\u2019, discusses its incorporation into a narrative about feminist methodology and presents and comments on new data collected in a follow-up to the BAM study conducted 37 years later. It argues that the complex political and social relationship between researcher and researched cannot easily be fitted into a paradigm of \u2018feminist\u2019 research, and that the concepts of a gift and of friendship as components in this relationship deserve more attention. \u00a9 2015, SAGE Publications.
