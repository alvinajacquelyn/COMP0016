We have determined the lattice parameters of perdeuterated melamine, C 3 N 6 D 6 , as a function of temperature (4.2\u2013320 K) close to atmospheric pressure and as a function of pressure (0\u20135 GPa) at room temperature, using time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction methods. Our observations confirm that the ambient-pressure P2 1 /a structure persists throughout this range of P and T. Both the thermal expansion and the compressibility are highly anisotropic; the principal directions of greatest thermal expansion and greatest compressibility are roughly perpendicular to the corrugated sheets of H-bonded melamine molecules that form the main structural motif. Complementary ab initio calculations (van der Waals corrected Density Functional Theory) provide an estimate of how the inter- and intra-molecular geometry may alter as a function pressure in the athermal limit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["compressibility", "high-pressure", "Melamine", "neutron diffraction", "thermal expansion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Function of pressure", "High pressure", "Molecular geometries", "Principal directions", "Structural motifs", "Thermoelastic properties", "Time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061601403", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"7004475745": {"Name": "Fortes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7004475745", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Neutron Spallation Souce, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "36448990000": {"Name": "Funnell N.P.", "AuthorID": "36448990000", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Neutron Spallation Souce, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7102232119": {"Name": "Bull C.L.", "AuthorID": "7102232119", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Neutron Spallation Souce, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
