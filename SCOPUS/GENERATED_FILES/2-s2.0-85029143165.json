The signal-centered diotic noise masker had a bandwidth of 20 or 200 Hz. For the 20-Hz wide masker, the binaural masking level difference (BMLD), i.e., threshold difference between diotic and dichotic signal, increased with signal duration and, for the 300-ms signal, the BMLD was larger with 50-ms rather than 6-ms ramps. These signal parameters hardly affected the BMLD for the 200-Hz wide masker.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Binaural masking-level differences", "Broadband masker", "Diotic noise", "Interaural phase differences", "Narrow bands", "Signal duration", "Signal parameters", "Signal-on"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029143165", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"7003818043": {"Name": "Verhey J.", "AuthorID": "7003818043", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Audiology, Otto von Guericke University"}, "57203606003": {"Name": "Yasin I.", "AuthorID": "57203606003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
