Methods A discrete choice experiment using a convenience sample of people diagnosed with HIV. Participants were recruited from 14 general HIV clinics in the South East of England between December 2014 and April 2015. ORs were calculated using conditional logit (CLOGIT) and latent class models (LCMs). Results A total of 1106 questionnaires were returned. Most participants were male (85%), white (74%) and were men who have sex with men (69%). The CLOGIT analysis showed people particularly valued shorter appointment waiting times (ORs between 1.52 and 3.62, p<0.001 in all instances). The LCM analysis showed there were two distinct classes, with 59% and 41% of respondents likely to be in each. The first class generally preferred GP to HIV clinic appointments and particularly valued 'being seen quickly'. For example, they had strong preferences for shorter appointment waiting times and longer GP opening hours. People in the second class also valued shorter waiting times, but they had a strong general preference for HIV clinic rather than GP appointments. Conclusions PLWHIV value many aspects of care for new health problems, particularly short appointment waiting times. However, they appear split in their general willingness to engage with GPs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HEALTH SERV RESEARCH", "HIV", "PATIENTS- VIEWS", "PRIMARY CARE"], "IndexKeywords": ["Appointments and Schedules", "Choice Behavior", "England", "General Practice", "Health Services Accessibility", "Health Services Research", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Patient Preference", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Primary Health Care", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983479222", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57203479433": {"Name": "Miners A.H.", "AuthorID": "57203479433", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "22938187600": {"Name": "Lagarde M.", "AuthorID": "22938187600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "8419298800": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.D.", "AuthorID": "8419298800", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health and Primary Care, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "56134290700": {"Name": "Youssef E.", "AuthorID": "56134290700", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health and Primary Care, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "36708602800": {"Name": "Pollard A.J.", "AuthorID": "36708602800", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Division of Public Health and Primary Care, Brighton and Sussex Medical School"}, "16686263300": {"Name": "Cooper V.L.", "AuthorID": "16686263300", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, NHS Trust"}, "57190381643": {"Name": "Nixon E.", "AuthorID": "57190381643", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, NHS Trust"}, "57203665899": {"Name": "Fisher M.", "AuthorID": "57203665899", "AffiliationID": "60003456", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genitourinary Medicine, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, NHS Trust"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "HIV Epidemiology and Biostatistics Group, University College London"}, "36242445300": {"Name": "Sachikonye M.", "AuthorID": "36242445300", "AffiliationID": "60120382", "AffiliationName": "UK Community Advisory Board Country (UKCAB)"}, "25822615600": {"Name": "Perry N.", "AuthorID": "25822615600", "AffiliationID": "60100018", "AffiliationName": "Brighton and Sussex Clinical Trials Unit, Brighton and Sussex Medical Schools"}}}
