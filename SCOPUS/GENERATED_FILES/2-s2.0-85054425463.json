Existing pediatric oximeter probes are prohibitively expensive and/or difficult to use, limiting LRS implementation. Using a human-centered design, we developed a low-cost, reusable pediatric oximeter probe for LRS health-care workers (HCWs). Here, we report probe usability testing. Fifty-one HCWs from Malawi, Bangladesh, and the United Kingdom participated, and seven experts provided reference measurements. Health-care workers and experts measured the peripheral arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) independently in < 5 year olds. Health-care worker measurements were classed as successful if recorded in 5 minutes (or shorter) and physiologically appropriate for the child, using expert measurements as the reference. All expert measurements were considered successful if obtained in < 5 minutes. We analyzed the proportion of successful SpO2 measurements obtained in < 1, < 2, and < 5 minutes and used multivariable logistic regression to predict < 1 minute successful measurements. We conducted four testing rounds with probe modifications between rounds, and obtained 1,307 SpO2 readings. Overall, 67% (876) of measurements were successful and achieved in < 1 minute, 81% (1,059) < 2 minutes, and 90% (1,181) < 5 minutes. Compared with neonates, increasing age (infant adjusted odds ratio [aOR]; 1.87,95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.16, 3.02; toddler aOR: 4.33,95%CI: 2.36, 7.97; child aOR; 3.90, 95% CI: 1.73, 8.81) and being asleep versus being calm (aOR; 3.53, 95% CI: 1.89, 6.58), were associated with < 1 minute successful measurements. In conclusion, wedesigned a novel, reusable pediatric oximetry probe that was effectively used by LRS HCWs on children. This probe may be suitable for LRS implementation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bangladesh", "Child", "Equipment Reuse", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Laboratory Proficiency Testing", "Logistic Models", "Malawi", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Oxyhemoglobins", "Pneumonia", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054425463", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57202476751": {"Name": "Boyd N.", "AuthorID": "57202476751", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Paul O'Gorman Bldg."}, "56680728700": {"Name": "Walker I.A.", "AuthorID": "56680728700", "AffiliationID": "112942652", "AffiliationName": "Lifebox Foundation"}, "56238681300": {"Name": "King C.", "AuthorID": "56238681300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "22935749500": {"Name": "Nambiar B.", "AuthorID": "22935749500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "16021435300": {"Name": "Colbourn T.", "AuthorID": "16021435300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "24350200200": {"Name": "Wilson I.", "AuthorID": "24350200200", "AffiliationID": "112942652", "AffiliationName": "Lifebox Foundation"}, "57192375634": {"Name": "Zadutsa B.", "AuthorID": "57192375634", "AffiliationID": "115289266", "AffiliationName": "Parent and Child Health Initiative"}, "55843426600": {"Name": "Makwenda C.", "AuthorID": "55843426600", "AffiliationID": "115289266", "AffiliationName": "Parent and Child Health Initiative"}, "57204087504": {"Name": "Bernstein M.", "AuthorID": "57204087504", "AffiliationID": "117045246", "AffiliationName": "Physio Monitor, LLC"}, "57202691454": {"Name": "Ahmed S.", "AuthorID": "57202691454", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University-Bangladesh"}, "57209362677": {"Name": "Roy A.", "AuthorID": "57209362677", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University-Bangladesh"}, "57214701896": {"Name": "Hanif A.A.M.", "AuthorID": "57214701896", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University-Bangladesh"}, "57213010975": {"Name": "Saha S.C.", "AuthorID": "57213010975", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University-Bangladesh"}, "57211985347": {"Name": "Majumder K.", "AuthorID": "57211985347", "AffiliationID": "60005248", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University-Bangladesh"}, "35404983600": {"Name": "Baqui A.H.", "AuthorID": "35404983600", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "35756146700": {"Name": "McCollum E.D.", "AuthorID": "35756146700", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Eudowood Division of Pediatric Respiratory Sciences, Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine"}}}
