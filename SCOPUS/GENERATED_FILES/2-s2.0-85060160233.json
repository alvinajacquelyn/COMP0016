These measurements were covered in 12 parallel talks, one flash talk and 11 posters. In this document, a discussion of results is grouped into four areas: electromagnetic interactions, jet quenching, quarkonia and heavy-flavour production, and collectivity in small and larger systems. Measurements from the xenon-xenon collisions based on a short run collected in October 2017 are reported for the first time.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ATLAS experiment", "collectivity in small systems", "heavy-flavour production", "jet quenching", "photon-induced processes", "quark-gluon plasma", "quarkonia production", "xenon-xenon collisions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060160233", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"]], "AuthorData": {"56978897300": {"Name": "Grabowska-Bold I.", "AuthorID": "56978897300", "AffiliationID": "60017351", "AffiliationName": "AGH University of Science and Technology"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
