Experimental intensities with 1% accuracy can be achieved with some care. An intercomparison of ab initio against experimental water intensities is presented for a variety of infrared bands for H2 16O and some for H2 18O and H2 17O. A new calculated H2 16O line list is presented for which uncertainties in the ab initio line intensities are evaluated. Much of the data show agreement within 2% between ab initio and experiment, however, for some bands, notably those involving excitation of some stretching modes, there are larger offsets of up to 8% attributed to ab initio calculation errors but still within the uncertainty of the ab initio calculation. In the \u03bd1 fundamental band differences of between +5% and \u221213% are found which show systematic dependence on wavenumber, \u0394Ka, and \u0394J, again attributable to ab initio calculation errors. In the \u03bd2 band, intensity-dependent differences up to 2% originate from the analysis of the experimental data. At present experiments are important to validate ab initio calculations but ab initio predictions can be very useful in validating the experiment. As the two procedures display significantly different systematic errors, it is suggested that combining both gives the best results; this study will also facilitate further improvements of the theoretical methodology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Absorption intensity", "FTIR spectroscopy", "Water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio calculations", "Ab initio prediction", "Absorption intensity", "FTIR spectroscopy", "Fundamental bands", "Intensity-dependent", "Line intensities", "Stretching modes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017353247", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"56264902800": {"Name": "Birk M.", "AuthorID": "56264902800", "AffiliationID": "60007798", "AffiliationName": "Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR)"}, "7404372644": {"Name": "Wagner G.", "AuthorID": "7404372644", "AffiliationID": "60007798", "AffiliationName": "Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR)"}, "56410559600": {"Name": "Loos J.", "AuthorID": "56410559600", "AffiliationID": "60007798", "AffiliationName": "Remote Sensing Technology Institute, German Aerospace Center (DLR)"}, "23486133800": {"Name": "Lodi L.", "AuthorID": "23486133800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006554518": {"Name": "Polyansky O.L.", "AuthorID": "7006554518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55901670600": {"Name": "Kyuberis A.A.", "AuthorID": "55901670600", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}, "35583085500": {"Name": "Zobov N.F.", "AuthorID": "35583085500", "AffiliationID": "60011774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences"}}}
