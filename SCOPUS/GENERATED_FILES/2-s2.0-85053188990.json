The diagnostic yield of thrombophilia screening remains controversial. We aimed to determine utility of current thrombophilia testing for young patients with stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Methods We present a retrospective review of all patients with stroke and TIA \u226460 years presenting to University College London Hospital stroke unit and daily TIA clinic from 1 January 2015 to 1 August 2016. Consecutive clinical records and thrombophilia tests, including factor V Leiden (FVL), prothrombin G20210A mutation (PGM), antiphospholipid antibody (APA), and protein S, C and antithrombin (AT) levels, were reviewed. Results The mean age of 628 patients with stroke and TIA was 49.1 years (SD 9.2). Thrombophilia testing was performed in 360 (57%) patients, including 171 with stroke and 189 with TIA. Positive tests were found in 50 (14%) patients, of whom 24 patients were <50 years. Positive results were found in 36 (10%) with acute ischaemic stroke, 4 (1%) with haemorrhagic stroke and 10 (3%) with TIA. Thirteen patients (4%) had homozygous/heterozygous FVL or PGM, and 27 (7.5%) had positive APA (anticardiolipin antibody, anti-\u03b22 glycoprotein antibody or lupus anticoagulant). Of 27 (7.5%) patients with protein C, S or AT deficiency, 10 (2.8%) had primary deficiency, presumed hereditary with other secondary causes excluded. 9% of patients with protein C, S or AT and 27% with APA were followed by confirmatory testing. Conclusion Thrombophilia testing was positive in only 14% of cases overall. Thrombophilia mutations and protein C, S or AT abnormalities were found rarely and were very uncommon in patients with TIA. Follow-up of abnormal results was generally poor for all groups, which further limited the impact of the thrombophilia testing policy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antiphospholipid antibody", "thrombophilia testing", "transient ischaemic attack", "young stroke"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053188990", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56659521000": {"Name": "Alakbarzade V.", "AuthorID": "56659521000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Hyper-acute Stroke Unit, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6603142203": {"Name": "Simister R.", "AuthorID": "6603142203", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Hyper-acute Stroke Unit, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25026624600": {"Name": "Chandratheva A.", "AuthorID": "25026624600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Hyper-acute Stroke Unit, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56767367600": {"Name": "Taylor A.", "AuthorID": "56767367600", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8709944400": {"Name": "Scully M.", "AuthorID": "8709944400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
