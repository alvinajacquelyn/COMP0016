Here, we report ab initio molecular dynamics to study the structural, hydrogen bonding, electronic, vibrational, and Raman properties of ice VII at this temperature and between 5 and 20 GPa to elucidate any possible hints of intramolecular strain that may serve as precursor events for proton hopping to unfold. We determine such equilibrium properties to be in reasonable agreement with experimental Raman spectra, although we do not detect any water-dissociation and proton-hopping events per se, owing to still-large water-dissociation free-energy barriers.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio molecular dynamics", "Equilibrium properties", "Ionic defects", "Pressure dependence", "Proton hopping", "Raman properties", "Self-diffusivity", "Water dissociation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047549297", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"32067636300": {"Name": "Futera Z.", "AuthorID": "32067636300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7004765766": {"Name": "English N.", "AuthorID": "7004765766", "AffiliationID": "60005141", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemical and Bioprocess Engineering, University College Dublin"}}}
