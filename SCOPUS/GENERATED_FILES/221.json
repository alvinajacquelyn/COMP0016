A CMOC score was calculated for each patient and included: pre-hospital ECG, acute use of aspirin, timely reperfusion, prescription at hospital discharge of aspirin, thienopyridine inhibitor, ACE-inhibitor (or equivalent), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker, and referral for cardiac rehabilitation. Mixed-effects logistic regression models evaluated the effect of CMOC on risk-adjusted 30-day and 1-year mortality (RAMR).RESULTS: 44.5% of patients were ineligible for \u22651 care component. Of patients eligible for all nine components, 50.6% missed \u22651 opportunity. Pre-hospital ECG and timely reperfusion were most frequently missed, predicting further missed care at discharge (pre-hospital ECG incident rate ratio [95% CI]: 1.64 [1.58-1.70]; timely reperfusion 9.94 [9.51-10.40]). Patients ineligible for care had higher RAMR than those eligible for care (30-days: 1.7% vs. 1.1%; 1-year: 8.6% vs. 5.2%), whilst those with no missed care had lower mortality than patients with \u22654 CMOC (30-days: 0.5% vs. 5.4%, adjusted OR (aOR) per CMOC group 1.22, 95% CI: 1.05-1.42; 1-year: 3.2% vs. 22.8%, aOR 1.23, 1.13-1.34).CONCLUSIONS: Opportunities for care in STEMI are commonly missed and significantly associated with early and later mortality. Thus, outcomes after STEMI may be improved by greater attention to missed opportunities to eligible care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Missed opportunities for care", "mortality", "STEMI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Coronary Syndrome", "Adrenergic beta-Antagonists", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors", "Aspirin", "Cohort Studies", "England", "Female", "Hospital Mortality", "Humans", "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors", "Kaplan-Meier Estimate", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Myocardial Infarction", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Registries", "Treatment Outcome", "Wales"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957790248", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"26868111800": {"Name": "Simms A.D.", "AuthorID": "26868111800", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60016418, 60107756", "AffiliationName": null}, "7005507388": {"Name": "Weston C.F.", "AuthorID": "7005507388", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": null}, "7402395730": {"Name": "West R.M.", "AuthorID": "7402395730", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": null}, "7403288408": {"Name": "Hall A.S.", "AuthorID": "7403288408", "AffiliationID": "60012070, 60006866", "AffiliationName": null}, "6602101015": {"Name": "Batin P.D.", "AuthorID": "6602101015", "AffiliationID": "60015692", "AffiliationName": null}, "7006508725": {"Name": "Timmis A.", "AuthorID": "7006508725", "AffiliationID": "120824340", "AffiliationName": null}, "7004642497": {"Name": "Hemingway H.", "AuthorID": "7004642497", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": null}, "35377460800": {"Name": "Fox K.", "AuthorID": "35377460800", "AffiliationID": "60110825, 60027272", "AffiliationName": null}, "35837808000": {"Name": "Gale C.P.", "AuthorID": "35837808000", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": null}}}
