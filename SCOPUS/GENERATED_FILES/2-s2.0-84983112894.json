Purpose: To compare basal serum levels of pituitary and sex hormones and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (S-IGF-1) in patients with iNPH and an age-matched control population, and to correlate the preoperative hormone levels with symptoms and signs pre-operatively and three months after surgery. Methods: A cross-sectional case control design was used. Patients diagnosed with iNPH, n = 108 (65 men and 43 women, mean age 72.3 years), were consecutively included during 2006-2011 at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. S-TSH, S-free T4, S-FSH, S-LH, S-prolactin, plasma ACTH, S-testosterone, S-oestradiol and S-IGF-1 were examined. Symptoms and signs were scored using the iNPH scale score. Population controls, n = 146, were recruited from the WHO MONICA project, Gothenburg in 2008. Results: Men and women with iNPH had higher S-IGF-1 than controls (p < 0.001). Women with iNPH had lower S-TSH (p = 0.016) than controls, but the frequency of levothyroxine substitution was similar. Among men, a higher level of S-IGF-1 was associated with milder symptoms, while higher levels of S-FSH and S-LH were associated with more severe symptoms. Conclusions: Patients with iNPH did not have lower levels of pituitary or sex hormones but presented with higher levels of S-IGF-1, compared with healthy, age-matched controls. Higher S-IGF-1 in men was related to milder mental and physical symptoms and signs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["IGF-1", "Normal pressure hydrocephalus", "Pituitary hormones", "Sex hormones"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adrenocorticotropic Hormone", "Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Estradiol", "Female", "Follicle Stimulating Hormone", "Humans", "Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure", "Hypopituitarism", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I", "Luteinizing Hormone", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prolactin", "Testosterone", "Thyrotropin", "Thyroxine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983112894", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"56973967500": {"Name": "Yang Y.", "AuthorID": "56973967500", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "7006696490": {"Name": "Wikkels\u00f6 C.", "AuthorID": "7006696490", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "6602137327": {"Name": "Landin-Wilhelmsen K.", "AuthorID": "6602137327", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Section for Endocrinology, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "55247289000": {"Name": "Oler\u00f6d G.", "AuthorID": "55247289000", "AffiliationID": "60079626, 60016437, 60027675", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry and Transfusion Medicine, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "7004130183": {"Name": "Isgaard J.", "AuthorID": "7004130183", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine, Institute of Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}}}
