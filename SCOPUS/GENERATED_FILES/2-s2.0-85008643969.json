We examined to what degree different types of EC mimic nicotine intake from cigarettes. Methods: Twelve participants (\u2018dual users\u2019 of EC and cigarettes) used their own brand cigarette and nine different EC brands. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at 2-min intervals for 10 min and again at 30 min. Results: Eleven smokers provided usable data. None of the EC matched cigarettes in nicotine delivery (Cmax = 17.9 ng/ml, Tmax = 4 min and AUC0\u2013>30 = 315 ng/ml/min). The EC with 48 mg/ml nicotine generated the closest PK profile (Cmax = 13.6 ng/ml, Tmax = 4 min, AUC0\u2013>30 = 245 ng/ml/min), followed by a third generation EC using 20 mg/ml nicotine (Cmax = 11.9 ng/ml, Tmax = 6 min, AUC0\u2013>30 = 232 ng/ml/min), followed by the tank system using 20 mg/ml nicotine (Cmax = 9.9 ng/ml, Tmax = 6 min, AUC0\u2013>30 = 201 ng/ml/min). Cig-a-like PK values were similar, ranging from Cmax 7.5 to 9.7 ng/ml, Tmax 4-6 min, and AUC0\u2013>30 144 to 173 ng/ml/min. Moderate differences in e-liquid nicotine concentrations had little effect on nicotine delivery, e.g. the EC with 24 mg/ml cartridge had the same PK profile as ECs with 16 mg/ml cartridges. Using similar strength e-liquid, the tank EC provided significantly more nicotine than cig-a-like ECs. Conclusions: EC brands we tested do not deliver nicotine as efficiently as cigarettes, but newer EC products deliver nicotine more efficiently than cig-a-like brands. Moderate variations in nicotine content of e-liquid have little effect on nicotine delivery. Smokers who are finding cig-a-like EC unsatisfactory should be advised to try more advanced systems.", "AuthorKeywords": ["E-cigarettes", "Nicotine delivery", "Smoking", "Vaping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Area Under Curve", "Cross-Over Studies", "Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Nicotine", "Nicotinic Agonists", "Smoking", "Tobacco Products", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008643969", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"7102231308": {"Name": "Hajek P.", "AuthorID": "7102231308", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Health and Lifestyle Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56850350100": {"Name": "Przulj D.", "AuthorID": "56850350100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Health and Lifestyle Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London"}, "56502888700": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "56502888700", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Health and Lifestyle Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57192894962": {"Name": "Anderson R.", "AuthorID": "57192894962", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Health and Lifestyle Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55931074900": {"Name": "McRobbie H.", "AuthorID": "55931074900", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Health and Lifestyle Research Unit, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
