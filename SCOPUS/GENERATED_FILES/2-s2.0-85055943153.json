The articles included report studies carried out in the United Kingdom and Chile (two quite different cultural contexts) originally supported by a British Academy International Partnership and Mobility grant to the two editors. These articles extend the work originally reported in Whitebread, Mercer, Howe & Tolmie (2013), bringing together a number of research traditions to develop our understanding of the contribution of dialogic processes in primary classrooms to the development of children\u2019s self-regulation. This commentary is intended to locate the present studies within the pre-existing research literature, to indicate the significant contributions made, and to pose an agenda for future research in this area.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Child", "Child Behavior", "Communication", "Humans", "Schools", "Self-Control", "Students"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055943153", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"6602657553": {"Name": "Whitebread D.", "AuthorID": "6602657553", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge"}, "36881679900": {"Name": "Grau V.", "AuthorID": "36881679900", "AffiliationID": "60029681", "AffiliationName": "Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Chile"}, "57201617489": {"Name": "Somerville M.P.", "AuthorID": "57201617489", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Human Development, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
