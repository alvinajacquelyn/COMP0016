How these ubiquitous proteins contribute to cell-type specific genome structure is poorly understood. Here, we explore quantitative aspects of topologically associated domains (TAD) between pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESC) and lineage-committed cells. ESCs exhibit permissive topological configurations which manifest themselves as increased inter- TAD interactions, weaker intra-TAD interactions, and a unique intra-TAD connectivity whereby one border makes pervasive interactions throughout the domain. Such \u2018stripe\u2019 domains are associated with both poised and active chromatin landscapes and transcription is not a key determinant of their structure. By tracking the developmental dynamics of stripe domains, we show that stripe formation is linked to the functional state of the cell through cohesin loading at lineage-specific enhancers and developmental control of CTCF binding site occupancy. We propose that the unique topological configuration of stripe domains represents a permissive landscape facilitating both productive and opportunistic gene regulation and is important for cellular identity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["CCCTC-Binding Factor", "Cell Cycle Proteins", "Cell Lineage", "Chromatin", "Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone", "Enhancer Elements, Genetic", "Pluripotent Stem Cells", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Species Specificity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068369054", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55513017800": {"Name": "Barrington C.", "AuthorID": "55513017800", "AffiliationID": "60107285", "AffiliationName": "Bioinformatics, The Francis Crick Institute"}, "55522202300": {"Name": "Georgopoulou D.", "AuthorID": "55522202300", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60120009", "AffiliationName": "CRUK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Li Ka Shing Centre"}, "23493637300": {"Name": "Pezic D.", "AuthorID": "23493637300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cancer Biology, University College London"}, "55201857400": {"Name": "Varsally W.", "AuthorID": "55201857400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cancer Biology, University College London"}, "6507289795": {"Name": "Hadjur S.", "AuthorID": "6507289795", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Cancer Biology, University College London"}, "23477304600": {"Name": "Herrero J.", "AuthorID": "23477304600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bill Lyons Informatics Centre, University College London"}}}
