Experimental pain sensitivity, reflecting the mechanisms of nociception and pain perception leading to clinical pain, is known to be enhanced in both diseases at advanced stages. Also, this study aimed at investigating experimental pain sensitivity already at an early stage (i.e. symptom duration \u22645 years). Methods: Experimental pain sensitivity was assessed by investigating the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR, reflecting spinal nociception) and heat and electrical pain thresholds. \u2018Off-drug\u2019 MSA (n = 11) and PD (n = 14) patients selected at an early stage of the disease were compared to healthy controls (HC, n = 27). MSA patients had either parkinsonian (MSA-P, n = 5) or cerebellar (MSA-C, n = 6) subtypes. Results: Compared to HC, MSA patients had lower heat pain sensitivity, whereas PD patients had reduced NFR threshold. MSA and PD patients did not differ from HC regarding other variables. MSA-P and MSA-C patients did not differ, either. Conclusions: Impaired sensory discrimination and attention deficits could contribute to the reduced perception of heat pain in MSA, whereas in PD, local changes in spinal excitability or a diminished dopaminergic descending inhibition might impact on the motor efference of the NFR to reduce its threshold to nociceptive afferent information. What does this study add?: This study investigated experimental pain sensitivity at an early stage in MSA and PD.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Case-Control Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Nociception", "Pain", "Pain Measurement", "Pain Threshold", "Parkinson Disease", "Reflex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959441258", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"6506392082": {"Name": "Mylius V.", "AuthorID": "6506392082", "AffiliationID": "117120566", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurorehabilitation"}, "57148057700": {"Name": "Pee S.", "AuthorID": "57148057700", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Philipps University"}, "57146726400": {"Name": "Pape H.", "AuthorID": "57146726400", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Philipps University"}, "6506207377": {"Name": "Teepker M.", "AuthorID": "6506207377", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Philipps University"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Movement Disorders Clinic, Second Department of Neurology, University of Athens"}, "7003983687": {"Name": "Eggert K.", "AuthorID": "7003983687", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Philipps University"}, "57198197973": {"Name": "Oertel W.H.", "AuthorID": "57198197973", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Philipps University"}, "7402922410": {"Name": "M\u00f6ller J.C.", "AuthorID": "7402922410", "AffiliationID": "113074812", "AffiliationName": "Parkinson Center, Center for Neurological Rehabilitation"}, "7006214637": {"Name": "Lefaucheur J.P.", "AuthorID": "7006214637", "AffiliationID": "60023970, 60025066, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Service de Physiologie \u2013 Explorations Fonctionnelles, H\u00f4pital Henri-Mondor, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Est"}}}
