Existing hand\u2013eye algorithms using closed-form solutions followed by iterative non-linear refinement provide accurate calibration results within a broad range of robotic applications. However, in the context of surgical robotics hand\u2013eye calibration is still a challenging problem due to the required accuracy within the millimetre range, coupled with a large displacement between endoscopic cameras and the robot end-effector. This paper presents a new method for hand\u2013eye calibration based on the adjoint transformation of twist motions that solves the problem iteratively through alternating estimations of rotation and translation. We show that this approach converges to a solution with a higher accuracy than closed form initializations within a broad range of synthetic and real experiments. We also propose a stereo hand\u2013eye formulation that can be used in the context of both our proposed method and previous state-of-the-art closed form solutions. Experiments with real data are conducted with a stereo laparoscope, the KUKA robot arm manipulator, and the da Vinci surgical robot, showing that both our new alternating solution and the explicit representation of stereo camera hand\u2013eye relations contribute to a higher calibration accuracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calibration problem", "Hand\u2013eye relationship", "Stereoscopic camera", "Surgical robot"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adjoint transformation", "Calibration problems", "Closed form solutions", "Da vinci surgical robots", "Explicit representation", "Rigid transformations", "Robotic assisted surgeries", "Stereoscopic camera", "Algorithms", "Calibration", "Eye", "Hand", "Humans", "Robotic Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050655749", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57192424135": {"Name": "Pachtrachai K.", "AuthorID": "57192424135", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and the Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "47862298300": {"Name": "Vasconcelos F.", "AuthorID": "47862298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and the Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55367064500": {"Name": "Chadebecq F.", "AuthorID": "55367064500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and the Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome / EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences (WEISS) and the Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55626720600": {"Name": "Allan M.", "AuthorID": "55626720600", "AffiliationID": "60105800", "AffiliationName": "Intuitive Surgical"}, "6602657397": {"Name": "Hailes S.", "AuthorID": "6602657397", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "13607280000": {"Name": "Pawar V.", "AuthorID": "13607280000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
