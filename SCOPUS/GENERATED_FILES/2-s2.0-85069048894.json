Through a review of education literature and a structured interview process, a set of elements that occur in the transition of staff to being a PjBL facilitator were identified. We contrast staff new to the technique with those who have been involved in this form of teaching for some time. The study presents the key skills and approaches that are developed in staff who engage in the facilitation of PjBL classes to deliver engineering education. Of foremost importance was the responsiveness of staff to be confident in supporting students\u2019 learning in an active learning environment where the student assumes much of the control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["faculty development", "Problem-based learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active Learning", "Active learning environment", "Development needs", "Engineering schools", "Faculty development", "Problem based learning", "Project based learning", "Staff perceptions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069048894", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"8207205100": {"Name": "Mitchell J.E.", "AuthorID": "8207205100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Engineering Education, University College London"}, "10141375400": {"Name": "Rogers L.", "AuthorID": "10141375400", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Education, University College London"}}}
