Recently, a third function of the hippocampus has been proposed: simulating future events. However, claims that the neural patterns underlying simulation occur without prior experience have come under fire in light of newly published data.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Memory consolidation", "Neural patterns", "Prior experience", "Spatial navigation", "Animals", "Brain Mapping", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958238232", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"8533186700": {"Name": "Bendor D.", "AuthorID": "8533186700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences"}, "6603575074": {"Name": "Spiers H.", "AuthorID": "6603575074", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Behavioural Neuroscience, Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences"}}}
