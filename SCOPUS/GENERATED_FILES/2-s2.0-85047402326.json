We present a 36-year-old woman with right anterior knee pain and a buttock mass. Imaging showed aggressive bone destruction within an area of fibrous dysplasia in the right femur and a mass with myxoid signal characteristics in the right adductor region. Biopsy of the femur revealed both fibrous dysplasia and a high-grade spindle cell sarcoma. Biopsy of the adductor mass confirmed a soft-tissue myxoma. Molecular genetic analysis revealed an identical R201H substitution in the GNAS1 gene in the sarcoma, the myxoma, and also the conventional fibrous dysplasia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fibrous dysplasia", "GNAS1 gene", "High-grade spindle cell sarcoma", "Mazabraud\u2019s syndrome", "Myxoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biopsy", "Buttocks", "Chromogranins", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Femoral Neoplasms", "Femur", "GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Myxoma", "Neoplasm Grading", "Point Mutation", "Sarcoma", "Soft Tissue Neoplasms", "Syndrome", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047402326", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"36127319200": {"Name": "Calleja M.", "AuthorID": "36127319200", "AffiliationID": "60024067", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, The Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "56932134800": {"Name": "O\u2019Donnell P.", "AuthorID": "56932134800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London"}, "36701180600": {"Name": "Amary F.", "AuthorID": "36701180600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
