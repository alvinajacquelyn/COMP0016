In this work, we propose a novel CS reconstruction method based on belief propagation principles, which manages to exploit side information generated from a diverse (or heterogeneous) data source by using the statistical model of copula functions. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields significant reduction in the mean-squared error of the reconstructed signal as compared to state-of-the-art methods in classical compressed sensing and compressed sensing with side information.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bayesian compressed sensing", "Belief propagation", "Compressive sensing", "Mean squared error", "Reconstruction method", "Signal of interests", "State-of-the-art methods", "Statistical modeling"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010064536", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56578539900": {"Name": "Zimos E.", "AuthorID": "56578539900", "AffiliationID": "60026810", "AffiliationName": "Vrije Universiteit Brussel-iMinds, Dept.
