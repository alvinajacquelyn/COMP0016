A group of researchers are pledging to make code they produce for data analysis and modeling open source, and are actively encouraging their colleagues to follow suit. Should custom software that is essential to reproducing results of publications be publicly released? Arguing that it must, Gleeson et al. have, together with other researchers, signed a commitment to releasing their code and will ask the same upon peer review.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Access to Information", "Information Dissemination", "Neurosciences", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037606384", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"16202455700": {"Name": "Gleeson P.", "AuthorID": "16202455700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7201936933": {"Name": "Silver R.", "AuthorID": "7201936933", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "8940202300": {"Name": "Davison A.", "AuthorID": "8940202300", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60106279", "AffiliationName": "Unit\u00e9 de Neuroscience, Information et Complexit\u00e9, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique"}, "7003505100": {"Name": "Ascoli G.", "AuthorID": "7003505100", "AffiliationID": "60018319", "AffiliationName": "Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study, George Mason University"}}}
