In this study, we evaluated the three-dimensional (3D) imaging performance of a 50 \u03bcm pixel pitch CMOS APS x-ray detector named DynAMITe (Dynamic Range Adjustable for Medical Imaging Technology). The two-dimensional (2D) angle-dependent modulation transfer function (MTF), normalized noise power spectrum (NNPS), and detective quantum efficiency (DQE) were experimentally characterized and modeled using the cascaded system analysis at oblique incident angles up to 30. The cascaded system model was extended to the 3D spatial frequency space in combination with the filtered back-projection (FBP) reconstruction method to calculate the 3D and in-plane MTF, NNPS and DQE parameters. The results demonstrate that the beam obliquity blurs the 2D MTF and DQE in the high spatial frequency range. However, this effect can be eliminated after FBP image reconstruction. In addition, impacts of the image acquisition geometry and detector parameters were evaluated using the 3D cascaded system analysis for DBT. The result shows that a wider projection angle range (e.g. \u00b130\u00b0) improves the low spatial frequency (below 5 mm-1) performance of the CMOS APS detector. In addition, to maintain a high spatial resolution for DBT, a focal spot size of smaller than 0.3 mm should be used. Theoretical analysis suggests that a pixelated scintillator in combination with the 50 \u03bcm pixel pitch CMOS APS detector could further improve the 3D image resolution. Finally, the 3D imaging performance of the CMOS APS and an indirect amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) thin-film transistor (TFT) passive pixel sensor (PPS) detector was simulated and compared.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cascaded system analysis", "CMOS active pixel sensor", "detective quantum efficiency", "digital breast tomosynthesis", "pixilated scintillator", "three-dimensional", "x-ray detector"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cascaded system", "CMOS active pixel sensors", "Complementary metal oxide semiconductors", "Detective quantum efficiency", "Digital breast tomosynthesis", "Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)", "Modulation transfer function (MTF)", "Three dimensional (3-D) imaging", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Mammography", "Models, Theoretical", "Radiometry", "Semiconductors", "X-Rays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013066278", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55936944800": {"Name": "Zhao C.", "AuthorID": "55936944800", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Solid-State Electronics Laboratory, University of Michigan"}, "7006407567": {"Name": "Kanicki J.", "AuthorID": "7006407567", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Solid-State Electronics Laboratory, University of Michigan"}, "36127143900": {"Name": "Vassiljev N.", "AuthorID": "36127143900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57205908360": {"Name": "Speller R.D.", "AuthorID": "57205908360", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "26026005600": {"Name": "Konstantinidis A.C.", "AuthorID": "26026005600", "AffiliationID": "60028784", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Radiology and Radiation Protection, Christie Medical Physics and Engineering, Christie NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
