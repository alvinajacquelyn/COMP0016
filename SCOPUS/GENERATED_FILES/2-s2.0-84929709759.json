We reanalysed Chard growth study data to explore the tempo of puberty based on changes in both height and hormone levels, using a novel method of growth curve analysis. Design and Subjects Schoolboys (n = 54) and girls (n = 70) from Chard, Somerset, England, recruited in 1981 at age 8/9 and followed to age 16. Measurements Every 6 months, height and Tanner stages (genitalia, breast, pubic hair) were recorded, and in a subsample (24 boys, 27 girls), blood samples were taken. Serum IGF-1, testosterone (boys) and oestradiol (girls) were measured by radioimmunoassay. Individual growth curves for each outcome were analysed using variants of the super-imposition by translation and rotation (SITAR) method, which estimates a mean curve and subject-specific random effects corresponding to size, and age and magnitude of peak velocity. Results The SITAR models fitted the data well, explaining 99%, 65%, 86% and 47% of variance for height, IGF-1, testosterone and oestradiol, respectively, and 69-88% for the Tanner stages. During puberty, the variables all increased steeply in value in individuals, the ages at peak velocity for the different variables being highly correlated, particularly for IGF-1 vs height (r = 0\u00b774 for girls, 0\u00b792 for boys). Conclusions IGF-1, like height, the sex steroids and Tanner stages, rises steeply in individuals during puberty, with the timings of the rises tightly synchronized within individuals. This suggests that IGF-1 may play an important role in determining the timing of puberty.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Development", "Body Height", "Child", "England", "Estradiol", "Female", "Humans", "Insulin-Like Growth Factor I", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Puberty", "Sexual Maturation", "Testosterone"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929709759", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"7201770477": {"Name": "Cole T.", "AuthorID": "7201770477", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Population Policy and Practice Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7402831598": {"Name": "Ahmed M.", "AuthorID": "7402831598", "AffiliationID": "106110174", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Children's Hospital"}, "35405875600": {"Name": "Preece M.", "AuthorID": "35405875600", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57203616076": {"Name": "Hindmarsh P.", "AuthorID": "57203616076", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56846858800": {"Name": "Dunger D.", "AuthorID": "56846858800", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, School of Clinical Medicine"}}}
