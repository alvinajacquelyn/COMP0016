Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Society for Rheumatology. All rights reserved.SLE has a complex pathogenesis, and multiple therapeutic targets have been discovered in recent years. In spite of belimumab being approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the widespread use of rituximab, there have been many failed attempts to treat SLE successfully using biologic agents. In this review, we consider newer biologic approaches that might offer the hope of improving the outcome of SLE patients. These include the fully humanized anti-CD20 mAbs, PEGylated anti-CD40L, IFN\u03b1 inhibitors, rigerimod and immune complexes blockade.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anti-CD20", "anti-CD40L", "biologic", "dapirolizumab", "FC\u03b3R", "interferon", "lupus", "obinutuzumab", "ofatumumab", "rigerimod"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized", "Biological Products", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments", "Immunologic Factors", "Interferon-alpha", "Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic", "Polyethylene Glycols", "Rituximab", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062515255", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57195941951": {"Name": "Carreira P.", "AuthorID": "57195941951", "AffiliationID": "60025001", "AffiliationName": "Autoimmune Diseases Unit, Internal Medicine 7.2 Department, Hospital Curry Cabral, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Central"}, "57201108555": {"Name": "Isenberg D.", "AuthorID": "57201108555", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Rheumatology, University College London, Room 424 the Rayne Building, Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine"}}}
