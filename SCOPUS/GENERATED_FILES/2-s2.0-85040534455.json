In order to achieve its science goals, the concentration of radon within the xenon should not exceed 2 \u03bcBq/kg, or 20 mBq total within its 10 tonnes. The LZ collaboration is in the midst of a program to screen all significant components in contact with the xenon. The four institutions involved in this effort have begun sharing two cross-calibration sources to ensure consistent measurement results across multiple distinct devices. We present here five preliminary screening results, some mitigation strategies that will reduce the amount of radon produced by the most problematic components, and a summary of the current estimate of radon emanation throughout the detector. This best estimate totals < 17.3 mBq, sufficiently low to meet the detector's science goals.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040534455", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57205973192": {"Name": "Miller E.H.", "AuthorID": "57205973192", "AffiliationID": "60018394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology"}, "57196038002": {"Name": "Leonard R.", "AuthorID": "57196038002", "AffiliationID": "60018394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology"}, "6701356491": {"Name": "Schnee R.W.", "AuthorID": "6701356491", "AffiliationID": "60018394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology"}, "7006379837": {"Name": "Busenitz J.", "AuthorID": "7006379837", "AffiliationID": "60025371", "AffiliationName": "University of Alabama, Department of Physics and Astronomy, 206 Gallalee Hall"}, "7202938806": {"Name": "Meng Y.", "AuthorID": "7202938806", "AffiliationID": "60025371", "AffiliationName": "University of Alabama, Department of Physics and Astronomy, 206 Gallalee Hall"}, "57206548983": {"Name": "Piepke A.", "AuthorID": "57206548983", "AffiliationID": "60025371", "AffiliationName": "University of Alabama, Department of Physics and Astronomy, 206 Gallalee Hall"}, "6602222993": {"Name": "Edberg T.K.", "AuthorID": "6602222993", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "University of Maryland, Department of Physics"}, "56641940000": {"Name": "Hall C.", "AuthorID": "56641940000", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "University of Maryland, Department of Physics"}, "9436366200": {"Name": "Ghag C.", "AuthorID": "9436366200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "57206737862": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "57206737862", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London (UCL), Department of Physics and Astronomy"}, "6604059087": {"Name": "Lesko K.", "AuthorID": "6604059087", "AffiliationID": "60007174", "AffiliationName": "Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL)"}}}
