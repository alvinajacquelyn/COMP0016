This gap leads to sub-optimal motor selection and hinders the application of advanced control schemes that would fulfill the goal of micro-precise surgery. This paper presents the design process and a dynamics study of a multi-Degree of Freedom (DoF) robotic system, which is inspired by established co-manipulation architectures. A rigorous kinematics and dynamics analysis of the robot's part that is responsible for manipulating the surgical tool during the retinal surgery phase is provided. In particular, the Euler-Lagrange equations of motion, which describe the dynamics of the 3-link surgical manipulator, are combined with novel analytical models of each link's corresponding transmission mechanism, including an anti-backlash lead screw assembly and a worm drive. The resulting models, transferable to existing manipulators, provide a meticulous analysis of the robot's performance that can be used both for mechanical design and control purposes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Advanced control schemes", "Euler-Lagrange equations", "Kinematics and dynamics analysis", "Limited information", "Multi degree-of-freedom", "Surgical manipulators", "Transmission mechanisms", "Vitreoretinal surgery"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063161615", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57039138200": {"Name": "Mablekos-Alexiou A.", "AuthorID": "57039138200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL"}, "6701376895": {"Name": "Da Cruz L.", "AuthorID": "6701376895", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "26422797000": {"Name": "Bergeles C.", "AuthorID": "26422797000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL"}}}
