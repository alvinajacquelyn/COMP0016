Undergraduates have been recognized as one of the populations with the highest incidence of self-injury. A substantial body of literature has documented the important influence of impulsivity on self-injury. However, few studies have focused on the mediating mechanisms underlying this relationship. Based on the stress generation hypothesis and the affect-regulation model of self-injury, this study constructed a chain mediating model to examine whether stressful life events and negative affect mediated the relationship between impulsivity and self-injury among Chinese undergraduates. Methods: A total of 2270 undergraduates (69.8% female, mean age = 19 years) were recruited to participate in this study and completed self-report measures of impulsivity, self-injury, stressful life events and negative affect. Results: (1) There were significant positive correlations among impulsivity, stressful life events, negative affect and self-injury. (2) After controlling for the effect of gender, impulsivity still had a significant positive effect on self-injury. (3) Undergraduates\u2019 self-injury was affected by impulsivity partly through 3 different pathways: the mediating role of stressful life events, the mediating role of negative affect, and the chain mediating role of both stressful life events and negative affect. Conclusions: These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the risk factors for self-injury. Impulsivity, stressful life events, and negative affect might increase the occurrence of self-injury. In addition, the chain mediating effect of stressful life events and negative affect plays an important role in the occurrence of self-injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["A chain mediating effect", "Impulsivity", "Negative affect", "Self-injury", "Stressful life events"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Affect", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "China", "Female", "Humans", "Impulsive Behavior", "Life Change Events", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Self Report", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Students", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067292741", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57205182303": {"Name": "Mo J.", "AuthorID": "57205182303", "AffiliationID": "60022149", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, Tianjin Normal University"}, "57205179837": {"Name": "Wang C.", "AuthorID": "57205179837", "AffiliationID": "60022149", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, Tianjin Normal University"}, "56580979700": {"Name": "Jia X.", "AuthorID": "56580979700", "AffiliationID": "60022149, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education, Academy of Psychology and Behavior, Tianjin Normal University"}, "57209301003": {"Name": "Liu T.", "AuthorID": "57209301003", "AffiliationID": "60022149, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education, Academy of Psychology and Behavior, Tianjin Normal University"}, "56461738100": {"Name": "Lin L.", "AuthorID": "56461738100", "AffiliationID": "60022149, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Research Base of Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education, Academy of Psychology and Behavior, Tianjin Normal University"}, "57205181448": {"Name": "Niu X.", "AuthorID": "57205181448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
