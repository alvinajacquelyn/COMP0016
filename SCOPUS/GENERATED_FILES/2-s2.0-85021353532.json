The original ToL was developed by Shallice together with two scoring systems (ToL-SS). Another two ToL-SS were proposed by Anderson et al. and Krikorian et al. The purpose of this study is to provide normative data for four ToL-SS and explore the effects of demographic variables on ToL performance. Furthermore, we aimed to determine the discriminative validity of these ToL-SS in clinical samples. Method Four groups were included in the study: a normative sample of healthy adults (HC; n = 298); patients with Parkinson's disease with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 52) and without cognitive impairment (PD-ND; n = 57); and patients with schizophrenia (SCH; n = 28). The effects of demographic variables on ToL-SS were examined in the HC group. Between-groups comparisons of ToL-SS were conducted using regression analysis with dummy codes. Results All four ToL-SS were not significantly affected by age, whereas the effect of gender and education is not consistent. ToL-SS significantly (p <.05) differentiate HC from PD-MCI and SCH. Cohen's effect size coefficients d range from 0.68 to 1.29. Internal consistency coefficients (Cronbach's \u03b1) of ToL-SS range from 0.33 to 0.60. Conclusions Despite poor to questionable internal consistency of ToL-SS, the discriminative validity and clinical utility for assessing planning deficits in PD-MCI and SCH are high. This study provides normative standards for all four ToL-SS on an adult population for use in clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Parkinson's disease mild cognitive impairment", "Planning", "Schizophrenia", "Scoring", "Tower of London"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parkinson Disease", "Reference Values", "Reproducibility of Results", "Schizophrenia", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021353532", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56038473300": {"Name": "Michalec J.", "AuthorID": "56038473300", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Charles University in Prague"}, "24478283500": {"Name": "Harsa P.", "AuthorID": "24478283500", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Charles University in Prague"}, "36118577000": {"Name": "Bezdicek O.", "AuthorID": "36118577000", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Centre of Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Charles University in Prague"}, "55441360400": {"Name": "Nikolai T.", "AuthorID": "55441360400", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Centre of Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Charles University in Prague"}, "6701631254": {"Name": "Jech R.", "AuthorID": "6701631254", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Centre of Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Charles University in Prague"}, "7005253383": {"Name": "Ruzicka E.", "AuthorID": "7005253383", "AffiliationID": "60039507, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology and Centre of Clinical Neuroscience, First Faculty of Medicine and General University Hospital in Prague, Charles University in Prague"}, "55018358100": {"Name": "Silhan P.", "AuthorID": "55018358100", "AffiliationID": "60068908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, General University Hospital in Ostrava"}, "57190176509": {"Name": "Hyza M.", "AuthorID": "57190176509", "AffiliationID": "60068908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, General University Hospital in Ostrava"}, "57204280404": {"Name": "Shallice T.", "AuthorID": "57204280404", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
