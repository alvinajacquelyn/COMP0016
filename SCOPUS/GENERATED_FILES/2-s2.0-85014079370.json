We compared children with ASD, ADHD or ADHD+ASD and typically developing controls (CTRL) on behavioural and electrophysiological correlates of gaze cue and face processing. We measured effects of ASD, ADHD and their interaction on the EDAN, an ERP marker of orienting visual attention towards a spatially cued location and the N170, a right-hemisphere lateralised ERP linked to face processing. We identified atypical gaze cue and face processing in children with ASD and ADHD+ASD compared with the ADHD and CTRL groups. The findings indicate a neurobiological basis for the presence of comorbid ASD symptoms in ADHD. Further research using larger samples is needed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADHD", "ASD", "Comorbidity", "ERPs", "Face processing", "Gaze cueing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity", "Autism Spectrum Disorder", "Child", "Comorbidity", "Cues", "Facial Recognition", "Female", "Fixation, Ocular", "Humans", "Male"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014079370", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"23049653500": {"Name": "Groom M.J.", "AuthorID": "23049653500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "16318916900": {"Name": "Kochhar P.", "AuthorID": "16318916900", "AffiliationID": "60033353", "AffiliationName": "Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust"}, "25628234500": {"Name": "Liddle E.B.", "AuthorID": "25628234500", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "57193454133": {"Name": "Simeou M.", "AuthorID": "57193454133", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7006624553": {"Name": "Hollis C.", "AuthorID": "7006624553", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "38060964400": {"Name": "Hamilton A.", "AuthorID": "38060964400", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Nottingham"}}}
