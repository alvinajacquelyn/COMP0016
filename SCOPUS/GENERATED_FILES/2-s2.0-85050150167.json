At 298 K, dppm reacts to give mononuclear [Re(CO)3(\u03ba1-dppm)(\u03ba2-S,N-thpymS)] (2) through a phosphine-promoted scission of the dithiolate bridges that leaves one of the phosphine moieties free (dangling). Refluxing 2 in toluene leads to CO loss and formation of dinuclear [Re2(CO)4(\u03bc-dppm)(\u03bc,\u03ba2-S,N-thpymS)2] (3) whose rhenium centers are bridged by two thiolate groups and the dppm ligand. Treatment of 1 with dppe at room temperature furnishes [Re(CO)3(\u03ba2-S,N-thpymS)]2(\u03bc,\u03ba1,\u03ba1-dppe) (4) where each phosphine center ligates the respective d6-ML5 rhenium fragment. Complex 4 exists as two distinct configurational isomers (4a and 4b) that have been isolated and the solid-state structures characterized crystallographically. The principal difference in the stereoisomeric products is the orientation of the two [Re(CO)3(\u03ba2-S,N-thpymS)] moieties at the anti-staggered Newman projection involving the P-C-C-P backbone of the dppe ligand. Both stereoisomers retain their identity in solution at ambient temperatures but equilibrate to a 1:1 mixture upon heating at 363 K for 1 h. The reaction of 1 with dppe in toluene at 383 K affords [Re(CO)2(\u03ba1-dppe)2(\u03ba2-S,N-thpymS)] (5) containing two monodentate (dangling) diphosphine ligands. Thus, these seemingly simple reactions afford a range of different products whose composition is highly dependent upon the experimental conditions employed and the nature of the diphosphine backbone. The reaction of 1 with dppe and the process responsible for the equilibration of the two configurational isomers of 4 have been investigated by electronic structure calculations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["DFT", "Diphosphines", "Rhenium", "Tetrahydropyrimidine-2-thiolate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational studies", "Configurational isomers", "Diphosphines", "Electronic structure calculations", "Experimental conditions", "Newman projections", "Solid-state structures", "Thiolates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050150167", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57201281038": {"Name": "Moni M.", "AuthorID": "57201281038", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "24366466600": {"Name": "Ghosh S.", "AuthorID": "24366466600", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "7006918410": {"Name": "Kabir S.", "AuthorID": "7006918410", "AffiliationID": "60029276", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Jahangirnagar University"}, "6701473214": {"Name": "Mobin S.", "AuthorID": "6701473214", "AffiliationID": "60104350", "AffiliationName": "Discipline of Chemistry, School of Basic Science, Indian Institute of Technology Indore"}, "7005072839": {"Name": "Tocher D.", "AuthorID": "7005072839", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004115416": {"Name": "Hogarth G.", "AuthorID": "7004115416", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "7103239169": {"Name": "Richmond M.", "AuthorID": "7103239169", "AffiliationID": "60024438", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of North Texas"}}}
