KGaA, Weinheim.The mechanisms of cell-cell communications are now under intense study by proteomic approaches. Proteomics has unraveled changes in protein profiling as the result of cell interactions mediated by ligand/receptor, hormones, soluble factors, and the content of extracellular vesicles. Besides being a brief overview of the main and profitable methodologies now available (evaluating theory behind the methods, their usefulness, and pitfalls), this review focuses on-from a proteome perspective-some signaling pathways and post-translational modifications (PTMs), which are essential for understanding ischemic lesions and their recovery in two vital organs in mammals, the heart, and the kidney. Knowledge of misdirection of the proteome during tissue recovery, such as represented by the convergence between fibrosis and cancer, emerges as an important tool in prognosis. Proteomics of cell-cell interaction is also especially useful for understanding how stem cells interact in injured tissues, anticipating clues for rational therapeutic interventions. In the effervescent field of induced pluripotency and cell reprogramming, proteomic studies have shown what proteins from specialized cells contribute to the recovery of infarcted tissues. Overall, we conclude that proteomics is at the forefront in helping us to understand the mechanisms that underpin prevalent pathological processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cell biology", "Cell communication", "Cell signaling", "Extracellular vesicles", "Proteomic models", "Secretome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Communication", "Extracellular Vesicles", "Humans", "Ischemia", "Mass Spectrometry", "Myocardial Infarction", "Proteome", "Proteomics", "Regeneration", "Signal Transduction"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955587083", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"33568078300": {"Name": "Lindoso R.", "AuthorID": "33568078300", "AffiliationID": "107483284", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Science and Technology for Structural Biology and Bioimaging"}, "24476955000": {"Name": "Carvalho A.", "AuthorID": "24476955000", "AffiliationID": "107483284", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Science and Technology for Structural Biology and Bioimaging"}, "7004760759": {"Name": "Vieyra A.", "AuthorID": "7004760759", "AffiliationID": "112471349", "AffiliationName": "Translational Biomedicine Graduate Program, Grand Rio University"}, "36100808900": {"Name": "Sandim V.", "AuthorID": "36100808900", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Leopoldo de Meis Institute of Medical Biochemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "7004709816": {"Name": "Zingali R.", "AuthorID": "7004709816", "AffiliationID": "101936055", "AffiliationName": "Proteomic Network of Rio de Janeiro"}, "23481116400": {"Name": "Collino F.", "AuthorID": "23481116400", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Translational Center of Regenerative Medicine, University of Turin/Fresenius Medical Care"}, "24476981200": {"Name": "Dias J.", "AuthorID": "24476981200", "AffiliationID": "60014878", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Cancer"}, "56199683900": {"Name": "da Costa M.", "AuthorID": "56199683900", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Pharmacy, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro"}}}
