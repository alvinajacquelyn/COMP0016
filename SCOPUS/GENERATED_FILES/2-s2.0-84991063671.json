This study aimed primarily to develop a transparent root canal model to study in situ Enterococcus faecalis biofilm removal rate and remaining attached biofilm using passive or active irrigation solution for 90 s. The change in available chlorine and pH of the outflow irrigant were assessed. Methods A total of forty root canal models (n = 10 per group) were manufactured using 3D printing. Each model consisted of two longitudinal halves of an 18 mm length simulated root canal with size 30 and taper 0.06. E. faecalis biofilms were grown on the apical 3 mm of the models for 10 days in Brain Heart Infusion broth. Biofilms were stained using crystal violet for visualization. The model halves were reassembled, attached to an apparatus and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Following 60 s of 9 mL of 2.5% NaOCl irrigation using syringe and needle, the irrigant was either left stagnant in the canal or activated using gutta-percha, sonic and ultrasonic methods for 30 s. Images were then captured every second using an external camera. The residual biofilm percentages were measured using image analysis software. The data were analyzed using Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and generalized linear mixed model. Results The highest level of biofilm removal was with ultrasonic agitation (90.13%) followed by sonic (88.72%), gutta-percha (80.59%), and passive irrigation group (control) (43.67%) respectively. All agitation groups reduced the available chlorine and pH of NaOCl more than that in the passive irrigation group. Significance The 3D printing method provided a novel model to create a root canal simulation for studying and understanding a real-time biofilm removal under microscopy. Ultrasonic agitation of NaOCl left the least amount of residual biofilm in comparison to sonic and gutta-percha agitation methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D printing model", "Automated agitation", "Biofilm", "Enterococcus faecalis", "Manual agitation", "Sodium hypochlorite"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-D printing", "Automated agitation", "Enterococcus faecalis", "Manual agitation", "Sodium hypochlorites", "Biofilms", "Dental Pulp Cavity", "Humans", "Printing, Three-Dimensional", "Root Canal Irrigants", "Root Canal Preparation", "Sodium Hypochlorite", "Therapeutic Irrigation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991063671", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"57191498181": {"Name": "Mohmmed S.a.", "AuthorID": "57191498181", "AffiliationID": "60071147", "AffiliationName": "Department of Conservative Dentistry, College of Dentistry, University of Baghdad"}, "6603066611": {"Name": "Mordan N.", "AuthorID": "6603066611", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "26643634100": {"Name": "Knowles J.C.", "AuthorID": "26643634100", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}, "7004875184": {"Name": "Vianna M.E.", "AuthorID": "7004875184", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Dentistry, College of Biomedical and Lifesciences, Cardiff University"}, "56258044400": {"Name": "Penny M.R.", "AuthorID": "56258044400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Life Sciences, University College London"}, "7102480402": {"Name": "Hilton S.T.", "AuthorID": "7102480402", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Faculty of Life Sciences, University College London"}}}
