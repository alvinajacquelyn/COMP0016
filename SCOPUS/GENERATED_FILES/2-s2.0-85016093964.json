A sensitivity analysis is carried out for thirty geometrical configurations of piers and spandrels under two different vertical loading conditions. The numerical analyses are performed with the use of a continuum finite element model enhanced with a crack-tracking technique. This approach is chosen due to its capacity to model accurately cracking phenomena in quasi-brittle materials, yielding realistic collapse mechanisms. The study aims to give an insight on the variation of the capacity and ductility of the structure, as well as the obtained damage pattern, in respect to the relative geometry between piers and spandrels. The results are also useful for the calibration of simplified modelling approaches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Collapse mechanism", "Geometrical configurations", "Horizontal loading", "Masonry structures", "Quasibrittle material", "Simplified modelling", "Structural response", "Tracking techniques"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016093964", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Materials Science (miscellaneous)", "MATE", "2501"]], "AuthorData": {"56426609100": {"Name": "Saloustros S.", "AuthorID": "56426609100", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, UPC-BarcelonaTech"}, "26325055100": {"Name": "Pel\u00e0 L.", "AuthorID": "26325055100", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, UPC-BarcelonaTech"}, "7102347663": {"Name": "Cervera M.", "AuthorID": "7102347663", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, UPC-BarcelonaTech"}, "7005448369": {"Name": "Roca P.", "AuthorID": "7005448369", "AffiliationID": "60007592", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, UPC-BarcelonaTech"}, "57211644046": {"Name": "D\u2019Ayala D.", "AuthorID": "57211644046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}}}
