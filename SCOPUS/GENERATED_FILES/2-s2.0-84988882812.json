Uniquely, we are able to constrain the scalar, vector and tensor degrees of freedom alike; previous studies only considered the vector mode (linked to vorticity). We employ Bianchi type VIIh cosmologies to model the anisotropic Universe, from which other types may be obtained by taking suitable limits. In a separate development, we improve the statistical analysis by including the effect of Bianchi power in the high-\u2113, as well as the low-\u2113, likelihood. To understand the effect of all these changes, we apply our new techniques to Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data. We find no evidence for anisotropy, constraining shear in the vector mode to (\u03c3V/H)0 < 1.7 \u00d7 10-10 (95 per cent confidence level). For the first time, we place limits on the tensor mode; unlike other modes, the tensor shear can grow from a near-isotropic early Universe. The limit on this type of shear is (\u03c3T, reg/H)0 < 2.4 \u00d7 10-7 (95 per cent confidence level).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmic background radiation", "Cosmology: miscellaneous", "Early Universe", "Gravitation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988882812", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57219788795": {"Name": "Saadeh D.", "AuthorID": "57219788795", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "22036053000": {"Name": "Pontzen A.", "AuthorID": "22036053000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "46461013400": {"Name": "Feeney S.M.", "AuthorID": "46461013400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Blackett Laboratory, Imperial College London"}, "8559862200": {"Name": "McEwen J.D.", "AuthorID": "8559862200", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory (MSSL), University College London"}}}
