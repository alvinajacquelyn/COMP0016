The objectives of this study were therefore to develop such a grading system and to validate it on patients who underwent surgical resection. A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify features on pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that predict the surgical outcome of patients with GBM. In all, the five most important features of GBM on pre-operative MRI were as follows: periventricular or deep location, corpus callosum or bilateral location, eloquent location, size and associated oedema. These were then used to develop a grading system. To validate this grading system, a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients with supratentorial GBM who underwent surgical resection between the 1 January 2014 and the 31 June 2015 was performed. There was a substantial agreement between the two neurosurgeons grading GBM (Cohen\u2019s \u03ba was 0.625; standard error 0.066). High-complexity lesions were significantly less likely to result in complete resection of contrast-enhancing tumour than low-complexity lesions (50.0 versus 3.4%; p = 0.0007). The proposed grading system may allow for the standardised communication of anatomical features of GBM identified on pre-operative MRI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Complications", "Glioblastoma multiforme", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Resection", "Surgical outcome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Female", "Glioblastoma", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Grading", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Retrospective Studies", "Supratentorial Neoplasms", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012927317", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"16643089500": {"Name": "Marcus H.J.", "AuthorID": "16643089500", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60015150", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Research Fellow and Specialty Registrar in Neurosurgery, Hamlyn Centre, Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55694086700": {"Name": "Hughes-Hallett A.", "AuthorID": "55694086700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College"}, "23468804200": {"Name": "Camp S.J.", "AuthorID": "23468804200", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7005763096": {"Name": "Nandi D.", "AuthorID": "7005763096", "AffiliationID": "60111785, 60012558", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Charing Cross Hospital, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "57188667890": {"Name": "Williams S.", "AuthorID": "57188667890", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Imperial College"}, "7005963244": {"Name": "Thorne L.", "AuthorID": "7005963244", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, UCLH Foundation Trust"}}}
