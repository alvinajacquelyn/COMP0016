The modified polymers were characterised by UV-Vis absorbance spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The three paint systems were moderately stable under aqueous conditions, with a limited amount of leaching of the dyes from the paint polymer into the surrounding aqueous solution. Exposure of the three paint systems to a 28 W white light source induced the lethal photosensitisation of both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Moreover, both the three-dye and two-dye systems resulted in a 4log kill against S. aureus under dark conditions, and a 1.5log dark kill was obtained by the safranin O and 2 nm gold nanoparticle system.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aqueous condition", "Copolymer emulsions", "Gold nanoparticle system", "Gold Nanoparticles", "Photosensitisation", "Staphylococcus aureus", "UV-vis absorbance", "White light sources"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943626620", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56897033200": {"Name": "Beech S.", "AuthorID": "56897033200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36448358200": {"Name": "Noimark S.", "AuthorID": "36448358200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "19337695800": {"Name": "Page K.", "AuthorID": "19337695800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55511810300": {"Name": "Noor N.", "AuthorID": "55511810300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "35848365800": {"Name": "Allan E.", "AuthorID": "35848365800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute, University College London"}}}
