The MM cells further promote a highly inflammatory microenvironment, which contributes to tumor initiation, development, severity and propagation. We reasoned that the anti-inflammatory actions of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and further antitumor effects of MSCs engineered to overexpress tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) protein (MSC-TRAIL) would effectively inhibit mesothelioma growth. Using a mouse xenograft model of intraperitoneal human mesothelioma, native mouse (mMSCs) or human (hMSC) MSCs were administered either systemically (intravenously or intraperitoneally) at various times following tumor inoculation. Both mMSCs and hMSCs localized at the sites of MM tumor growth in vivo and decreased local infl ammation. Further, a trend towards decrease in tumor burden was observed. Parallel studies of in vitro exposure of nine primary human mesothelioma cell lines to mMSCs or hMSCs demonstrated reduced tumor cell migration. MSC-TRAIL exposure induced apoptosis of TRAIL-sensitive MM cells in vitro, and both mouse and human MSC-TRAIL significantly reduced the inflammatory tumor environment in vivo. Moreover, human MSC-TRAIL administration signifi cantly reduced peritoneal tumor burden in vivo and increased tumor cell apoptosis. These proof-of-concept studies suggest that TRAIL-expressing MSCs may be useful against malignant mesothelioma.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy", "Cytokines", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Mesothelioma", "Mice", "Mice, SCID", "TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand", "Tumor Burden", "Tumor Microenvironment", "Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921868728", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"55573754900": {"Name": "Lathrop M.J.", "AuthorID": "55573754900", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine/Pulmonary, University of Vermont"}, "7102304894": {"Name": "Brooks E.M.", "AuthorID": "7102304894", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine/Pulmonary, University of Vermont"}, "36460743400": {"Name": "Cruz F.", "AuthorID": "36460743400", "AffiliationID": "60000036", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biophysics Carlos Chagas Filho, Federal, University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "55573558800": {"Name": "Bonenfant N.R.", "AuthorID": "55573558800", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine/Pulmonary, University of Vermont"}, "55571955300": {"Name": "Sokocevic D.", "AuthorID": "55571955300", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine/Pulmonary, University of Vermont"}, "57192810603": {"Name": "Weiss D.J.", "AuthorID": "57192810603", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine/Pulmonary, University of Vermont"}, "24554447800": {"Name": "Sage E.K.", "AuthorID": "24554447800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, University College London"}, "55418537000": {"Name": "Macura S.L.", "AuthorID": "55418537000", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Vermont"}, "15832143500": {"Name": "MacPherson M.B.", "AuthorID": "15832143500", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Vermont"}, "24168078500": {"Name": "Beuschel S.L.", "AuthorID": "24168078500", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Vermont"}, "57203702733": {"Name": "Shukla A.", "AuthorID": "57203702733", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Vermont"}, "7103088815": {"Name": "Mossman B.T.", "AuthorID": "7103088815", "AffiliationID": "60009500", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Vermont"}, "37107414600": {"Name": "Dunaway C.W.", "AuthorID": "37107414600", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine University of Alabama at Birmingham"}, "7101798803": {"Name": "Steele C.", "AuthorID": "7101798803", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, School of Medicine University of Alabama at Birmingham"}}}
