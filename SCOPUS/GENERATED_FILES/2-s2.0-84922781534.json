The proposed antenna is composed of a loop, a monopole, a horizontal ground plane and a vertical reflector. The antenna's operation principle is investigated and some design guidelines are laid down in the beginning. Then, an optimized loop-monopole composite antenna is designed. It is demonstrated that the antenna covers two bands from 2.16 to 3.21 GHz and from 4.24 to 7 GHz for S11 smaller than -10dB. The antenna has stable, unidirectional radiation pattern within its pass-bands. The average gain of the antenna is 4.5dBi (lower band) and 7.7dBi (higher band). The proposed antenna can be used as an indoor base station antenna for multiband wireless communications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dual-band antenna", "loop-monopole composite antenna", "unidirectional antenna"], "IndexKeywords": ["Base station antennas", "Dual Band", "Dual band antennas", "Ground planes", "Pass bands", "Two bands", "Unidirectional antenna", "Wireless communications"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922781534", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56486201200": {"Name": "Wu X.", "AuthorID": "56486201200", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "55484291200": {"Name": "Lu W.", "AuthorID": "55484291200", "AffiliationID": "107652545", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves"}, "56486211400": {"Name": "Xu J.", "AuthorID": "56486211400", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "8882010600": {"Name": "Zhu H.", "AuthorID": "8882010600", "AffiliationID": "60009400", "AffiliationName": "Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Wireless Communications, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications"}, "7102473419": {"Name": "Tong K.", "AuthorID": "7102473419", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
