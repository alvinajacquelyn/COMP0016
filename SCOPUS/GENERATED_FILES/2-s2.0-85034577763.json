However, the association between the severity of locomotor disability and socio-demographic variables has never been investigated in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross sectional survey of adults with locomotor disabilities was conducted between December 2010 and February 2011 at the Centre for the Rehabilitation of the Paralysed (CRP), Dhaka, Bangladesh. During the study period 328 adults with locomotor disabilities met our selection criteria, but 316 consented and participated in the study. The 55-item Locomotor Disability Scale was used to measure disability. This study investigated the socio-demographic determinants of the severity of locomotor disability: age, gender, marital status, educational attainment, occupation, income status, type of house, living in own/rented house, household monthly income, household population and area of residence. Results: Participants' age was positively associated with the severity of their locomotor disability (\u03b2 = 0.01; 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.02), adjusting for diagnosis and other socio-demographic variables studied. Individuals who had an income experienced 0.35 (95% CI: -0.63 to -0.07) points decrease in the severity of disability than those did not have an income, adjusting for diagnosis and rest of the socio-demographic variables studied. In comparison to the unemployed individuals, students, homemakers, and individuals in elementary occupation respectively experienced 0.75 (95% CI: -1.08 to -0.43), 0.51 (95% CI: -0.82 to -0.19) and 0.37 (95% CI: -0.66 to -0.08) points decrease in the severity of locomotor disability, adjusting for diagnosis and rest of the socio-demographic variables studied. Conclusions: The severity of locomotor disability has an association with individuals' age, income status and occupation of the adults with such disability in Bangladesh. No such association was evident with other socioeconomic position and demographic variables. This finding suggests that people with locomotor disabilities in Bangladesh experience similar disabling built and attitudinal environments irrespective of their socioeconomic positions and demographic characteristics. Further community-based studies are needed to confirm such conclusions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bangladesh", "Determinants", "Disability", "Locomotor disability", "Physical disability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034577763", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"15846049700": {"Name": "Mahmud I.", "AuthorID": "15846049700", "AffiliationID": "60008935", "AffiliationName": "BRAC University, James P Grant School of Public Health"}, "7201975104": {"Name": "Clarke L.", "AuthorID": "7201975104", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "14020124700": {"Name": "Ploubidis G.B.", "AuthorID": "14020124700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Centre for Longitudinal Studies, Department of Social Science"}}}
