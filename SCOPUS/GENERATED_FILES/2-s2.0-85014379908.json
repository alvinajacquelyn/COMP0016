In this study, we first conduct experiments of horizontal oil-water flows in a small diameter pipe, and collect the fluctuation signals from conductance probes. The multi-scale power-law correlations of the oil-water flow structures are investigated using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) based on the magnitude and sign decomposition of the raw signals. The analysis reveals the scaling behavior of different flow structures; five conductive flow patterns are indentified based on the magnitude and sign scaling exponents at different time scales. In addition, the transfer entropy (TE) in a state space is used to study the information transferring characteristics of the oil-water mixture flowing past a conductance cross-correlation velocity probe. The results of TE indicate that the transferring information depends on the flow conditions and can be used to show changes in the flow patterns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Flow pattern identification", "Flow structure", "Horizontal oil-water two-phase flow", "Magnitude and sign correlations", "Transfer entropy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Detrended fluctuation analyses (DFA)", "Different time scale", "Flow pattern identification", "Magnitude and sign correlations", "Oil-water two phase flows", "Power-law correlations", "Small diameter pipe", "Transfer entropy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014379908", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Fluid Flow and Transfer Processes", "CENG", "1507"]], "AuthorData": {"55264995200": {"Name": "Zhai L.", "AuthorID": "55264995200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004882176": {"Name": "Jin N.", "AuthorID": "7004882176", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "57193498054": {"Name": "Zhou D.", "AuthorID": "57193498054", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "35792857800": {"Name": "Zhu L.", "AuthorID": "35792857800", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Information Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "7004488806": {"Name": "Angeli P.", "AuthorID": "7004488806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}}}
