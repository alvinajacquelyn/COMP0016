The nonlinear model proposed by Toland (Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal., vol. 289, 2008, pp. 325-362) is used to formulate the pressure exerted by the thin elastic sheet. The symmetric solitary waves previously found by Guyenne & P\u01cer\u01ceu (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 713, 2012, pp. 307-329) and Wang et al. (IMA J. Appl. Maths, vol. 78, 2013, pp. 750-761) are briefly reviewed. A new class of hydroelastic solitary waves which are non-symmetric in the direction of wave propagation is then computed. These asymmetric solitary waves have a multi-packet structure and appear via spontaneous symmetry-breaking bifurcations. We study in detail the stability properties of both symmetric and asymmetric solitary waves subject to longitudinal perturbations. Some moderate-amplitude symmetric solitary waves are found to be stable. A series of numerical experiments are performed to show the non-elastic behaviour of two interacting stable solitary waves. The large response generated by a localised steady pressure distribution moving at a speed slightly below the minimum of the phase speed (called the transcritical regime in the literature) is also examined. The direct numerical simulation of the fully nonlinear equations with a single load reveals that in this range the generated waves are of finite amplitude. This includes a perturbed depression solitary wave, which is qualitatively similar to the large response observed in experiments. The excitations of stable elevation solitary waves are achieved by applying multiple loads moving with a speed in the transcritical regime.", "AuthorKeywords": ["elastic waves", "solitary waves", "surface gravity waves"], "IndexKeywords": ["Elastic behaviour", "Finite amplitude", "Fully nonlinear equations", "Numerical experiments", "Spontaneous symmetry breaking", "Stability properties", "Surface gravity waves", "Transcritical regimes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953790718", "SubjectAreas": [["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"56640563600": {"Name": "Gao T.", "AuthorID": "56640563600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "7005594518": {"Name": "Vanden-Broeck J.", "AuthorID": "7005594518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "36705190000": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "36705190000", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Bath"}}}
