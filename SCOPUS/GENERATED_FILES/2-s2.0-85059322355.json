The optima hybrid energy systems are able to meet 7.23 kWh/day household's electrical energy demand. The hybrid energy system for each of the locations was optimally obtained based on HOMER software computation and TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making algorithm that considers technical, economic, environmental, and sociocultural criteria. Wind energy potential was conducted for the six locations using the Weibull distribution function; the wind speed ranges between 3.21 and 4.19 m/s at 10 m anemological height. The wind speeds and the wind characteristics were extrapolated for 30 m and 50 m hub heights. The solar resource potentials across the six locations are also presented \u2013 ranges between 4.21 and 4.71 kWh/m2/day. The best hybrid system for the locations in Benin-city, Yenagoa and Port Harcourt is the Diesel generator-PV-Wind-Battery system; whereas the best hybrid system for the locations in Warri, Uyo and Calabar is the PV-Wind-Battery system. The hybrid systems in Benin-city, Yenagoa and Port Harcourt emit CO2, only 8.47%, 15.02% and 14.09% of the business as usual (the diesel generator). The payback time ranges between 3.7 and 5.4 years, using 0.893 US$/kWh cost of energy obtained for the business as usual. The cost of energy of the hybrid systems ranges between 0.459 and 0.562 US$/kWh, which compares well with available data in the public domain. The design parameters of the optima hybrid energy systems are also presented. The methodology presented here will serve as a design tool for renewable energy professionals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Environment", "HOMER software", "Hybrid renewable energy", "Multi-criteria", "Techno-economic", "TOPSIS"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environment", "Homer softwares", "Hybrid renewable energies", "Multi-criteria", "Techno-economics", "TOPSIS"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059322355", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"]], "AuthorData": {"36149855400": {"Name": "Diemuodeke E.", "AuthorID": "36149855400", "AffiliationID": "60029544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Port Harcourt"}, "36149893500": {"Name": "Oko C.", "AuthorID": "36149893500", "AffiliationID": "60029544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Port Harcourt"}, "55173834100": {"Name": "Ojapah M.", "AuthorID": "55173834100", "AffiliationID": "60029544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Port Harcourt"}, "14826507400": {"Name": "Addo A.", "AuthorID": "14826507400", "AffiliationID": "60071885", "AffiliationName": "The Energy Centre, College of Engineering, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology"}, "6602891448": {"Name": "Mulugetta Y.", "AuthorID": "6602891448", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Science, Technology, Engineering & Public Policy (STEaPP), University College London"}}}
