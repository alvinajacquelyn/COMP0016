The aim of this study was to test whether the different susceptibilities to carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) of median nerve motor axons supplying the second lumbrical (L2) and abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles could be explained in this way. Methods: Computerized nerve-excitability testing was used to examine the excitability properties of the median motor axons of both L2 and APB in 24 healthy volunteers. Results: Although some excitability measurements differed between the L2 and APB motor axons, estimates of resting membrane potential (RMP) by model fitting indicated no significant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: Differences in RMP cannot account for the relative sparing of L2 axons in severe CTS. Significance: L2 sparing in CTS most likely has an anatomical rather than a biophysical basis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abductor pollicis brevis", "Carpal tunnel syndrome", "Lumbrical", "Nerve excitability", "Threshold tracking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Axons", "Carpal Tunnel Syndrome", "Electric Stimulation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Median Nerve", "Membrane Potentials", "Middle Aged", "Models, Theoretical", "Muscle, Skeletal"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929649299", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"56652311500": {"Name": "Paeing S.", "AuthorID": "56652311500", "AffiliationID": "60081368, 60033236", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Busan Paik Hospital, Inje University College of Medicine"}, "56651518400": {"Name": "Kang M.", "AuthorID": "56651518400", "AffiliationID": "60006034", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine"}, "56651519100": {"Name": "Ahn S.", "AuthorID": "56651519100", "AffiliationID": "60006034", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine"}, "56651280700": {"Name": "Lee M.", "AuthorID": "56651280700", "AffiliationID": "60006034", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine"}, "25958892800": {"Name": "Bae J.", "AuthorID": "25958892800", "AffiliationID": "60006034", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Kangdong Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine"}, "56651870900": {"Name": "Pyun S.", "AuthorID": "56651870900", "AffiliationID": "100517459", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, National Police Hospital"}, "7005459795": {"Name": "Bostock H.", "AuthorID": "7005459795", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
