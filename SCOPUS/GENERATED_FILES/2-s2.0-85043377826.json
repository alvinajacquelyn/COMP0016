Antibody-based treatments are growing in success for adult cancers but have shown limited efficacy for pediatric cancers. Pediatric solid tumors have a lower mutation load that their adult counterparts and pose a unique set of challenges compared to hematological malignancies and to adult solid tumors. Whilst a number of antibodies have been subject to clinical trials in pediatric patients the response tends to be limited and there is need to identify patients most likely to benefit. The role of antibodies in combination with conventional chemotherapy and new emerging therapies is a developing field that could provide new opportunities.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antibody therapy", "Clinical trial", "Hematological malignancies", "Most likely", "Pediatric cancer", "Pediatric patients", "Solid cancer", "Solid tumors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043377826", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57201095640": {"Name": "Birley K.", "AuthorID": "57201095640", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55731054400": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55731054400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7003689959": {"Name": "Chester K.", "AuthorID": "7003689959", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}}}
