In this context, the design of OXCs is becoming very challenging since they have to support both legacy lower bit-rates and future highspeed super-channels by means of flexible allocation of spectral resources, and at the same time provide high availability of established connections. In this paper we study the availability and power consumption of different node architectures. We focus on the design of the new generation of synthetic programmable OXCs based on the Architecture on Demand concept which can reduce the number of utilized node components when a certain part of signals is switched at the fibre level, resulting in lower mean down time and power consumption compared to traditional node architectures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Computer architecture", "Couplers", "Mirrors", "Optical signal procebing", "Optical switches", "Ports (Computers)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Flexible allocations", "High availability", "Long-haul networks", "Network availability", "Node architectures", "Optical signals", "Ports (Computers)", "Power efficiency"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960399475", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"55338448900": {"Name": "Dzanko M.", "AuthorID": "55338448900", "AffiliationID": "60159855, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Department of Telecommunications"}, "6602760627": {"Name": "Mikac B.", "AuthorID": "6602760627", "AffiliationID": "60159855, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "University of Zagreb, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Department of Telecommunications"}, "34972964400": {"Name": "Furdek M.", "AuthorID": "34972964400", "AffiliationID": "60002014", "AffiliationName": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology"}, "9274397600": {"Name": "Zervas G.", "AuthorID": "9274397600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Faculty of Engineering"}, "35219784900": {"Name": "Hugues-Salas E.", "AuthorID": "35219784900", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Faculty of Engineering"}, "12784155200": {"Name": "Simeonidou D.", "AuthorID": "12784155200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "University of Bristol, Faculty of Engineering"}}}
