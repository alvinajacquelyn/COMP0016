Over the last decade, there have been escalating concerns regarding the possible toxic effects, behaviour and fate of rGO in living systems and environments. This paper reports on integrative chemical-biological interactions of rGO with lung cancer cells, i.e. A549 and SKMES-1, to determine its potential toxicological impacts on them, as a function of its concentration. Cell viability, early and late apoptosis and necrosis were measured to determine oxidative stress potential, and induction of apoptosis for the first time by comparing two lung cancer cells. We also showed the general trend between cell death rates and concentrations for different cell types using a Gaussian process regression model. At low concentrations, rGO was shown to significantly produce late apoptosis and necrosis rather than early apoptotic events, suggesting that it was able to disintegrate the cellular membranes in a dose dependent manner. For the toxicity exposures undertaken, late apoptosis and necrosis occurred, which was most likely resultant from limited bioavailability of unmodified rGO in lung cancer cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["apoptosis", "cell viability", "necrosis", "reduced graphene oxide nanosheets", "toxicity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological interactions", "Biomedical applications", "Cell viability", "Dose-dependent manner", "Gaussian process regression model", "necrosis", "Reduced graphene oxides", "Reduced graphene oxides (RGO)", "A549 Cells", "Apoptosis", "Cell Survival", "Graphite", "Humans", "Necrosis", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Oxidative Stress", "Oxides", "Reactive Oxygen Species"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85035349832", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55484476700": {"Name": "Tabish T.A.", "AuthorID": "55484476700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "54788955800": {"Name": "Hayat H.", "AuthorID": "54788955800", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "55308934100": {"Name": "Zhang S.", "AuthorID": "55308934100", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "56495569700": {"Name": "Pranjol M.Z.I.", "AuthorID": "56495569700", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus"}, "57197859109": {"Name": "Abdullah T.M.", "AuthorID": "57197859109", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus"}, "6602306036": {"Name": "Whatmore J.L.", "AuthorID": "6602306036", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, University of Exeter Medical School, St Luke's Campus"}, "56315501400": {"Name": "Rahat A.A.M.", "AuthorID": "56315501400", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Exeter"}}}
