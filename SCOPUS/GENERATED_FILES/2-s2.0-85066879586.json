We measured physical changes (weight, size) during the formation and growth of fungus pellets and the pH values that influence the adsorption performance and biosorption mechanism. Three acid anionic dyes containing Acid Orange 56, Acid Blue 40 and Methyl Blue were chosen as model dyes to investigate batch adsorption efficiency. Two adsorption models (in vivo and in vitro) were adopted to decolorize the acid dyes. The results show that fungus pellets have excellent decoloration abilities with a high adsorption efficiency of 98% for 200 mg L-1 of acid dye. The pH value of the dye solution varied with the adsorption time and the dye removal efficiency greatly depended on the pH. The bioadsorption mechanism of nano-scale hyphae was revealed to be mainly due to electrostatic interactions caused by the pH change. Furthermore, the surface morphologies of the fungus after adsorption indicated that the dyes had been adsorbed on the surface of the fungus mycelia. Moreover, prepared 3D fungus/GO aerogels demonstrated superior dye removal abilities compared with fungus aerogels.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adsorption efficiency", "Adsorption performance", "Aspergillus niger", "Batch adsorption", "Biosorption mechanism", "High efficiency technology", "Physical changes", "Textile wastewater"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066879586", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56499668800": {"Name": "Li S.", "AuthorID": "56499668800", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "National Engineering Laboratory for Modern Silk, College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University"}, "55846447700": {"Name": "Huang J.", "AuthorID": "55846447700", "AffiliationID": "60017605", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemical Engineering, Fuzhou University"}, "55627760000": {"Name": "Lai Y.", "AuthorID": "55627760000", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "National Engineering Laboratory for Modern Silk, College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University"}, "57188738079": {"Name": "Mao J.", "AuthorID": "57188738079", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "National Engineering Laboratory for Modern Silk, College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University"}, "57188739566": {"Name": "He C.", "AuthorID": "57188739566", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "National Engineering Laboratory for Modern Silk, College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University"}, "26431766500": {"Name": "Chen G.", "AuthorID": "26431766500", "AffiliationID": "60010432", "AffiliationName": "National Engineering Laboratory for Modern Silk, College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55709122400": {"Name": "Zhang L.", "AuthorID": "55709122400", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
