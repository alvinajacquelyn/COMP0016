Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.The HerA-NurA helicase-nuclease complex cooperates with Mre11 and Rad50 to coordinate the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Little is known, however, about the assembly mechanism and activation of the HerA-NurA. By combining hybrid mass spectrometry with cryo-EM, computational and biochemical data, we investigate the oligomeric formation of HerA and detail the mechanism of nucleotide binding to the HerA-NurA complex from thermophilic archaea. We reveal that ATP-free HerA and HerA-DNA complexes predominantly exist in solution as a heptamer and act as a DNA loading intermediate. The binding of either NurA or ATP stabilizes the hexameric HerA, indicating that HerA-NurA is activated by substrates and complex assembly. To examine the role of ATP in DNA translocation and processing, we investigated how nucleotides interact with the HerA-NurA. We show that while the hexameric HerA binds six nucleotides in an 'all-or-none' fashion, HerA-NurA harbors a highly coordinated pairwise binding mechanism and enables the translocation and processing of double-stranded DNA. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal novel inter-residue interactions between the external ATP and the internal DNA binding sites. Overall, here we propose a stepwise assembly mechanism detailing the synergistic activation of HerA-NurA by ATP, which allows efficient processing of double-stranded DNA.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Archaeal Proteins", "Binding Sites", "Deoxyribonucleases", "DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded", "DNA Helicases", "DNA Repair", "DNA, Archaeal", "Models, Molecular", "Nucleic Acid Conformation", "Protein Binding", "Protein Domains", "Protein Multimerization", "Sulfolobus solfataricus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039842603", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57189466236": {"Name": "Ahdash Z.", "AuthorID": "57189466236", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "57075745700": {"Name": "Lau A.M.", "AuthorID": "57075745700", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "7102881729": {"Name": "Booth P.J.", "AuthorID": "7102881729", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "55366538500": {"Name": "Reading E.", "AuthorID": "55366538500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "35097785800": {"Name": "Politis A.", "AuthorID": "35097785800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, King's College London"}, "25821898200": {"Name": "Byrne R.T.", "AuthorID": "25821898200", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Gene Center and Department of Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "22980058800": {"Name": "Lammens K.", "AuthorID": "22980058800", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Gene Center and Department of Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "7003594195": {"Name": "Hopfner K.P.", "AuthorID": "7003594195", "AffiliationID": "60028717", "AffiliationName": "Gene Center and Department of Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "56652340500": {"Name": "St\u00fcetzer A.", "AuthorID": "56652340500", "AffiliationID": "60032895", "AffiliationName": "Bioanalytical Mass Spectrometry Group, MPI for Biophysical Chemistry"}, "35354800900": {"Name": "Urlaub H.", "AuthorID": "35354800900", "AffiliationID": "60021110", "AffiliationName": "Bioanalytics Group, Institute for Clinical Chemistry, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen"}}}
