For compact groups controllability is well understood and is dealt with using the Lie algebra rank criterion. Gaussian systems, however, evolve under Hamiltonians generating the non-compact symplectic group, rendering the rank criterion necessary but no longer sufficient. In this setting it is possible to satisfy the rank criterion without the ability to enact all symplectic transformations. We refer to such systems as 'unstable' and explore the set of symplectic transformations that remain reachable. We provide a partial analytical characterisation for the reachable set of a single-mode unstable system. From this it is proven that no orthogonal-symplectic operations ('energy-preserving' or 'passive' in the literature) may be reached with such controls. We then apply numerical optimal control algorithms to demonstrate a complete characterisation of the set in specific cases. These results suggest approaches to the long-standing open problem of controllability in n modes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["control theory", "Gaussian states", "symplectic group"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015806921", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Mathematical Physics", "MATH", "2610"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193676966": {"Name": "Shackerley-Bennett U.", "AuthorID": "57193676966", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8977729200": {"Name": "Genoni M.", "AuthorID": "8977729200", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Quantum Technology Lab, Dipartimento di Fisica"}, "7006026939": {"Name": "Serafini A.", "AuthorID": "7006026939", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57193684553": {"Name": "Pitchford A.", "AuthorID": "57193684553", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, Aberystwyth University"}, "8432158100": {"Name": "Burgarth D.", "AuthorID": "8432158100", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, Aberystwyth University"}}}
