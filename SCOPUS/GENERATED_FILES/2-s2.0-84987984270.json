Aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films are also shown to be deposited when aluminum acetylacetonate [Al(acac)3] was introduced into the precursor solution, illustrating the versatility of this system. Film characterization techniques include glancing angle X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and optical and electrical measurements. AZO films with an Al content of 7 at.% were found to have favourable transparent conducting oxide properties with simultaneous high transparency (> 80%) in the visible light region and a low electrical resistivity (1.96 \u00d7 10\u2212 3 \u03a9 cm).", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aerosol assisted chemical vapour deposition", "Thin films", "Transparent conducting oxide", "Zinc oxide", "Zinc triflate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Aluminum acetylacetonate", "Aluminum-doped zinc oxide", "Aluminum-doped zinc oxide thin films", "Film characterizations", "Transparent conductive", "Trifluoromethanesulfonate", "Zinc triflates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987984270", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Surfaces and Interfaces", "PHYS", "3110"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56550091500": {"Name": "Manzi J.", "AuthorID": "56550091500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24923462200": {"Name": "Knapp C.", "AuthorID": "24923462200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
