Axon arbor architecture, a major determinant of synaptic connectivity, is shaped by localized growth responses, but it is unknown whether LPS influences these responses in vivo. Using high-resolution live imaging, we examined the spatiotemporal dynamics of RNA and LPS in retinal axons during arborization in vivo. Endogenous RNA tracking reveals that RNA granules dock at sites of branch emergence and invade stabilized branches. Live translation reporter analysis reveals that de novo \u03b2-actin hotspots colocalize with docked RNA granules at the bases and tips of new branches. Inhibition of axonal \u03b2-actin mRNA translation disrupts arbor dynamics primarily by reducing new branch emergence and leads to impoverished terminal arbors. The results demonstrate a requirement for LPS in building arbor complexity and suggest a key role for pre-synaptic LPS in assembling neural circuits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["axon branching", "axon guidance", "FRAP", "local protein synthesis", "mitochondria", "neural wiring", "retinotectal projection", "RNA labeling", "RNA localization", "RNA trafficking", "\u03b2-actin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Actins", "Animals", "Anisomycin", "Axons", "Biotin", "Blastomeres", "Carbocyanines", "Cycloheximide", "Deoxyuracil Nucleotides", "Embryo, Nonmammalian", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "In Vitro Techniques", "Luminescent Proteins", "Mitochondria", "Morpholinos", "Oligonucleotides, Antisense", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Protein Synthesis Inhibitors", "Retina", "RNA", "Xenopus laevis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027311410", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"57188979987": {"Name": "Wong H.", "AuthorID": "57188979987", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57020068900": {"Name": "Lin J.", "AuthorID": "57020068900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57190300457": {"Name": "Roque C.", "AuthorID": "57190300457", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "55983934000": {"Name": "Cioni J.", "AuthorID": "55983934000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57194110463": {"Name": "Cagnetta R.", "AuthorID": "57194110463", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "56746273000": {"Name": "Turner-Bridger B.", "AuthorID": "56746273000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "57203693369": {"Name": "Harris W.", "AuthorID": "57203693369", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "7202381167": {"Name": "Holt C.", "AuthorID": "7202381167", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Development and Neuroscience, University of Cambridge"}, "56709567700": {"Name": "Str\u00f6hl F.", "AuthorID": "56709567700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "56545241500": {"Name": "Laine R.", "AuthorID": "56545241500", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}, "7003673210": {"Name": "Kaminski C.", "AuthorID": "7003673210", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge"}}}
