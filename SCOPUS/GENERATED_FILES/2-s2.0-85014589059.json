The aim of the study was to investigate the determinants of vitamin D2 and D3 and to identify the risk factors associated with hypovitaminosis D. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966. Participants: 2374 male and 2384 female participants with data on serum 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 concentrations measured at 31 years of age (1997), together with comprehensive measures of daylight, anthropometric, social, lifestyle and contraceptive cofactors. Methods: We assessed a wide range of potential determinants prior to a nationwide fortification programme introduced in Finland. The determinants of 25(OH)D2, 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)D concentrations were analysed by linear regression and risk factors for being in lower tertile of 25(OH)D concentration by ordinal logistic regression. Results: At the time of sampling, 72% of the participants were vitamin D sufficient (\u226550 nmol/L). Low sunlight exposure period (vs high) was associated positively with 25(OH)D2 and negatively with 25(OH)D3 concentrations. Use of oral contraceptives (vs nonusers) was associated with an increase of 0.17 nmol/L (95% CI 0.08 to 0.27) and 0.48 nmol/L (95% CI 0.41 to 0.56) in 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 concentrations. Sex, season, latitude, alcohol consumption and physical activity were the factors most strongly associated with 25(OH)D concentration. Risk factors for low vitamin D status were low sunlight exposure defined by time of sampling, residing in northern latitudes, obesity, higher waist circumference, low physical activity and unhealthy diet. Conclusions: We demonstrate some differential associations of environmental and lifestyle factors with 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 raising important questions related to personalised healthcare. Future strategies could implement lifestyle modification and supplementation to improve vitamin D2 and D3 status, accounting for seasonal, lifestyle, metabolic and endocrine status.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anthropometry", "Contraception", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Finland", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Sunlight", "Vitamin D", "Vitamin D Deficiency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014589059", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57130487600": {"Name": "Palaniswamy S.", "AuthorID": "57130487600", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Center for Life Course Health Research, University of Oulu"}, "57193534954": {"Name": "Lowry E.", "AuthorID": "57193534954", "AffiliationID": "60012954", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Center for Life Course Health Research, University of Oulu"}, "7007026450": {"Name": "Herzig K.H.", "AuthorID": "7007026450", "AffiliationID": "60007252", "AffiliationName": "CEU Cardenal Herrera University"}, "57207896735": {"Name": "J\u00e4rvelin M.R.", "AuthorID": "57207896735", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175886", "AffiliationName": "MRC-PHE Centre for Environment and Health, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "57203721635": {"Name": "Sebert S.", "AuthorID": "57203721635", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genomics of Complex Diseases, School of Public Health, Imperial College London"}, "7003684252": {"Name": "Jokelainen J.", "AuthorID": "7003684252", "AffiliationID": "60016622", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Unit of Primary Care, Oulu University Hospital"}, "7005459718": {"Name": "Kein\u00e4nen-Kiukaanniemi S.", "AuthorID": "7005459718", "AffiliationID": "60016622", "AffiliationName": "MRC and Unit of Primary Care, Oulu University Hospital"}, "55884875400": {"Name": "Hypp\u00f6nen E.", "AuthorID": "55884875400", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice, Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "36700717800": {"Name": "Williams D.M.", "AuthorID": "36700717800", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet"}}}
