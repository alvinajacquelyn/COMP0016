The MFD-1 cell line was isolated from a 55-year-old male with OAC without recombinant-DNA transformation. Somatic genetic variations from MFD-1, tumour, normal oesophagus, and leucocytes were analysed with SNP6. WGS was performed in tumour and leucocytes. RNAseq was performed in MFD-1, and two classic OAC cell lines FLO1 and OE33. Transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) was performed in MFD-1, OE33, and non-neoplastic HET1A cells. Functional studies were performed. MFD-1 had a high SNP genotype concordance with matched germline/tumour. Parental tumour and MFD-1 carried four somatically acquired mutations in three recurrent mutated genes in OAC: TP53, ABCB1 and SEMA5A, not present in FLO-1 or OE33. MFD-1 displayed high expression of epithelial and glandular markers and a unique fingerprint of open chromatin. MFD-1 was tumorigenic in SCID mouse and proliferative and invasive in 3D cultures. The clinical utility of whole genome sequencing projects will be delivered using accurate model systems to develop molecular-phenotype therapeutics. We have described the first such system to arise from the oesophageal International Cancer Genome Consortium project.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adenocarcinoma", "Base Sequence", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Genome, Human", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Phenotype"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987680020", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56473213100": {"Name": "Garcia E.", "AuthorID": "56473213100", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "36999708900": {"Name": "Hayden A.", "AuthorID": "36999708900", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "24066213300": {"Name": "Birts C.", "AuthorID": "24066213300", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "56179722600": {"Name": "Cowie A.", "AuthorID": "56179722600", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "6602124286": {"Name": "Pickard K.", "AuthorID": "6602124286", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "8655197800": {"Name": "Mellone M.", "AuthorID": "8655197800", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "57191163185": {"Name": "Choh C.", "AuthorID": "57191163185", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "6701511026": {"Name": "Derouet M.", "AuthorID": "6701511026", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "42361083100": {"Name": "Duriez P.", "AuthorID": "42361083100", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "26634306100": {"Name": "Noble F.", "AuthorID": "26634306100", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "56597309100": {"Name": "White M.J.", "AuthorID": "56597309100", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "7005091532": {"Name": "Primrose J.N.", "AuthorID": "7005091532", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "6506933469": {"Name": "Strefford J.C.", "AuthorID": "6506933469", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "9737015600": {"Name": "Rose-Zerilli M.", "AuthorID": "9737015600", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "35464458200": {"Name": "Thomas G.J.", "AuthorID": "35464458200", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "23978947100": {"Name": "Underwood T.J.", "AuthorID": "23978947100", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, Mailpoint 801"}, "57191162004": {"Name": "Britton E.", "AuthorID": "57191162004", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester"}, "9536496500": {"Name": "Ang Y.", "AuthorID": "9536496500", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester"}, "7006229641": {"Name": "Sharrocks A.D.", "AuthorID": "7006229641", "AffiliationID": "60172345", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester"}, "57203177024": {"Name": "Fitzgerald R.C.", "AuthorID": "57203177024", "AffiliationID": "60120019, 60031668, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cancer Unit, University of Cambridge, Hutchison/MRC Research Centre, Box 197, Cambridge Biomedical Campus"}}}
