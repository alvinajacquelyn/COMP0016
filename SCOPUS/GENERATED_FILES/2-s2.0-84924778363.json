Vomeronasal stimuli are typically secreted in various body fluids. Following direct contact with urine deposits or other secretions, a peristaltic vascular pump mediates fluid entry into the recipient\u2019s VNO. Therefore, while vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) sample various stimulatory semio-chemicals dissolved in the intraluminal mucus, they might also be affected by the general physicochemical properties of the \u201csolvent.\u201d Here, we report cycle stage-correlated variations in urinary pH among female mice. Estrus-specific pH decline is observed exclusively in urine samples from sexually experienced females. Moreover, patch-clamp recordings in acute VNO slices reveal that mouse VSNs reliably detect extracellular acidosis. Acid-evoked responses share the biophysical and pharmacological hallmarks of the hyperpolarization-activated current I<inf>h</inf>. Mechanistically, VSN acid sensitivity depends on a pH-induced shift in the voltage-dependence of I<inf>h</inf> activation that causes the opening of HCN channels at rest, thereby increasing VSN excitability. Together, our results identify extracellular acidification as apotent activator of vomeronasal I<inf>h</inf> and suggest HCN channel-dependent vomeronasal gain control of social chemosignaling. Our data thus reveal a potential mechanistic basis for stimulus pH detection in rodent chemosensory communication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["HCN", "Ion channel", "Signaling", "Vomeronasal organ"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Estrus", "Female", "Hydrogen-Ion Concentration", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Olfactory Bulb", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Sensory Receptor Cells", "TRPC Cation Channels", "Vomeronasal Organ"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924778363", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55126182800": {"Name": "Cichy A.", "AuthorID": "55126182800", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}, "56136518100": {"Name": "Ackels T.", "AuthorID": "56136518100", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}, "56549918600": {"Name": "Tsitoura C.", "AuthorID": "56549918600", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}, "25654894800": {"Name": "Gronloh N.", "AuthorID": "25654894800", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}, "25951267400": {"Name": "Engelhardt C.", "AuthorID": "25951267400", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}, "14055027500": {"Name": "Spehr J.", "AuthorID": "14055027500", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}, "56550047800": {"Name": "Spehr X.", "AuthorID": "56550047800", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemosensation, Institute for Biology II, RWTH Aachen University"}, "15829440000": {"Name": "Kahan A.", "AuthorID": "15829440000", "AffiliationID": "108398115", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Department of Medical Neurobiology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "7004174956": {"Name": "Ben-Shaul Y.", "AuthorID": "7004174956", "AffiliationID": "108398115", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine, Department of Medical Neurobiology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "56550038800": {"Name": "Sochtig M.", "AuthorID": "56550038800", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Cellular Biophysics, Institute of Complex Systems, Forschungszentrum Julich"}, "7402078417": {"Name": "Muller F.", "AuthorID": "7402078417", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Cellular Biophysics, Institute of Complex Systems, Forschungszentrum Julich"}}}
