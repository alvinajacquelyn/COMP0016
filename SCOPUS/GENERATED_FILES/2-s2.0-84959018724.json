We here describe the rare association of dystonia with anarthria/aphonia, by examining a large cohort of patients, to provide a narrow field of underlying conditions and a practical algorithmic approach to reach diagnosis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed cases, which were evaluated between 2005 and 2014, to identify those with dystonia combined with marked anarthria and/or aphonia. We reviewed demographic information, clinical characteristics, as well as clinico-genetic investigations. We evaluated video material where available. Results: From 860 cases with dystonia as the predominant motor feature, we identified 32 cases (3.7%) with anarthria/aphonia. Age at neurological symptom onset was variable, but the majority of cases (n = 20) developed symptoms within their first eight years of life. A conclusive diagnosis was reached in 27 cases. Monoamine neurotransmitter disorders, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation syndromes, hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, and syndromes with inborn errors of metabolism were the most common diagnoses. Brain MRI was crucial for reaching a diagnosis by examining the structural integrity of the basal ganglia, the cerebral cortex, brain myelination and whether there was abnormal metal deposition. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying anarthria/aphonia included dystonia, corticobulbar involvement, apraxia and abnormalities of brain development. Conclusions: The spectrum of conditions that may present with the syndrome of dystonia with anarthria/aphonia is broad. Various causes may account for the profound speech disturbance. A practical brain MRI-based algorithm is provided to aid the diagnostic procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anarthria", "Aphonia", "Dystonia", "Speech disorder"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Aphonia", "Brain", "Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Dystonia", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)", "Retrospective Studies", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959018724", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"37101265800": {"Name": "Ganos C.", "AuthorID": "37101265800", "AffiliationID": "60005036", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE)"}, "57000272100": {"Name": "Taiwo F.", "AuthorID": "57000272100", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25642482400": {"Name": "Balint B.", "AuthorID": "25642482400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36450181000": {"Name": "Batla A.", "AuthorID": "36450181000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "36008087300": {"Name": "Erro R.", "AuthorID": "36008087300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "56148885300": {"Name": "Crowe B.", "AuthorID": "56148885300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "26647482400": {"Name": "Kurian M.A.", "AuthorID": "26647482400", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Neurosciences, Developmental Neurosciences, UCL-Institute of Child Health"}, "57208560010": {"Name": "Stamelou M.", "AuthorID": "57208560010", "AffiliationID": "60012556", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Clinic, Philipps University"}, "26644117100": {"Name": "Kresojevi\u0107 N.", "AuthorID": "26644117100", "AffiliationID": "60068827, 60068815", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, CCS, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade"}, "55499191300": {"Name": "Luki\u0107 M.J.", "AuthorID": "55499191300", "AffiliationID": "60068827, 60068815", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, CCS, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade"}, "6701477867": {"Name": "Svetel M.", "AuthorID": "6701477867", "AffiliationID": "60068827, 60068815", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, CCS, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade"}, "35239923400": {"Name": "Kosti\u0107 V.", "AuthorID": "35239923400", "AffiliationID": "60068827, 60068815", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, CCS, School of Medicine, University of Belgrade"}, "57200436456": {"Name": "Bras J.", "AuthorID": "57200436456", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57200994996": {"Name": "Guerreiro R.", "AuthorID": "57200994996", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "14036326000": {"Name": "Schneider S.A.", "AuthorID": "14036326000", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel"}}}
