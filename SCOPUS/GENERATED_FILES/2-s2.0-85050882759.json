The Experience of Caregiving Inventory (ECI) is 66 item self-report measure of the impact of caregiving for carers of people diagnosed with psychotic disorders. This study aimed to create a brief version of the ECI, and evaluate its reliability and validity (n = 626). Methods: The validation process was conducted through a Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) approach, using a graded response model and a complementary network approach. Results: This resulted in a 19 item, four factor inventory with a good model fit, displaying good reliability and validity. Conclusion: The BECI is a valid measure. The simplicity, ease of application and robust psychometric properties further enhances its acceptability and usefulness as a brief measure in clinical research and trials, as well as in routine practice providing reliable and valid data on experience of caregiving in families of an individual with psychosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carers", "Item response theory", "Psychometrics", "Psychosis", "Questionnaire development"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Caregivers", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Psychotic Disorders", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self Report", "Social Stigma", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050882759", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56311262300": {"Name": "O'Driscoll C.", "AuthorID": "56311262300", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "8963719200": {"Name": "Farrelly S.", "AuthorID": "8963719200", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": "Southwark North East Promoting Recovery in Psychosis Team, South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7101747718": {"Name": "Burgess P.", "AuthorID": "7101747718", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, The University of Queensland"}, "57196216155": {"Name": "Szmukler G.", "AuthorID": "57196216155", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "24377053800": {"Name": "Shaikh M.", "AuthorID": "24377053800", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "Research & Development Department, North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
