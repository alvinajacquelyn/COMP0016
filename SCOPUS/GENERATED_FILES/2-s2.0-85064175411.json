Two main types of TENS produce analgesia in animal models: high-frequency (\u223c50\u2013100 Hz) and low-intensity \u2018conventional\u2019 TENS, and low-frequency (\u223c2\u20134 Hz) and high-intensity \u2018acupuncture-like\u2019 TENS. However, TENS efficacy in human participants is debated, raising the question of whether the analgesic mechanisms identified in animal models are valid in humans. Here, we used a sham-controlled experimental design to clarify the efficacy and the neurobiological effects of \u2018conventional\u2019 and \u2018acupuncture-like\u2019 TENS in 80 human volunteers. To test the analgesic effect of TENS we recorded the perceptual and brain responses elicited by radiant heat laser pulses that activate selectively A\u03b4 and C cutaneous nociceptors. To test whether TENS has a long-lasting effect on brain state we recorded spontaneous electrocortical oscillations. The analgesic effect of \u2018conventional\u2019 TENS was maximal when nociceptive stimuli were delivered homotopically, to the same hand that received the TENS. In contrast, \u2018acupuncture-like\u2019 TENS produced a spatially-diffuse analgesic effect, coupled with long-lasting changes both in the state of the primary sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) and in the functional connectivity between S1/M1 and the medial prefrontal cortex, a core region in the descending pain inhibitory system. These results demonstrate that \u2018conventional\u2019 and \u2018acupuncture-like\u2019 TENS have different analgesic effects, which are mediated by different neurobiological mechanisms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analgesia", "Electroencephalography (EEG)", "Human", "Pain", "Resting state", "Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Analgesia", "Brain", "Electroencephalography", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064175411", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55263675100": {"Name": "Peng W.", "AuthorID": "55263675100", "AffiliationID": "60000937", "AffiliationName": "College of Psychology and Sociology, Shenzhen University"}, "57208230522": {"Name": "Li H.", "AuthorID": "57208230522", "AffiliationID": "60000937", "AffiliationName": "College of Psychology and Sociology, Shenzhen University"}, "57206576596": {"Name": "Tang Z.", "AuthorID": "57206576596", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55004151200": {"Name": "Kong Y.", "AuthorID": "55004151200", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "7401557322": {"Name": "Hu L.", "AuthorID": "7401557322", "AffiliationID": "60013156", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pain Management, The State Key Clinical Specialty in Pain Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University"}, "57205476739": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "57205476739", "AffiliationID": "60017010", "AffiliationName": "Research Center of Brain Cognitive Neuroscience, Liaoning Normal University"}, "55226971800": {"Name": "Iannetti G.", "AuthorID": "55226971800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
