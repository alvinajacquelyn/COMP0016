Above \u223c700 K the unit-cell volumes of the samples decrease approximately linearly with increasing Ni content. Below \u223c200 K the unit-cell volume of FeSi falls to a value between that of (Fe0.9Ni0.1)Si and (Fe0.8Ni0.2)Si. We attribute this extra contraction of the FeSi, which is a narrow band-gap semiconductor, to the depopulation of the conduction band at low temperatures; in the two alloys the additional electrons introduced by the substitution of Ni lead to the conduction band always being populated. We have fit the unit-cell volume data with a Debye internal energy model of thermal expansion and an additional volume term, above 800 K, to take account of the volumetric changes associated with changes in the composition of the sample. Using the thermophysical parameters of the fit we have estimated the band gap in FeSi to be 21(1) meV and the unit-cell volume change in FeSi associated with the depopulation of the conduction band to be 0.066(35) \u00c53/unit-cell.", "AuthorKeywords": ["band-gap", "heat capacity", "semiconductor", "x-ray diffraction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Internal energies", "Low temperatures", "Ni content", "Thermo-physical parameters", "Unit-cell volume", "Volumetric changes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026396258", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"24461613100": {"Name": "Hunt S.", "AuthorID": "24461613100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56203641200": {"Name": "Wann E.", "AuthorID": "56203641200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7006319791": {"Name": "Dobson D.", "AuthorID": "7006319791", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "6603903752": {"Name": "Vo\u010dadlo L.", "AuthorID": "6603903752", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "7102583827": {"Name": "Wood I.", "AuthorID": "7102583827", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
