The proof-of-concept single channel instrument utilises a low-cost commercially available optical transceiver module as a light source, controlled by a Kintex 7 field programmable gate array (FPGA). The FPGA modulates the optical transceiver with maximum-length sequences at line rates up to 10Gb/s, allowing us to achieve an instrument response function with full width at half maximum under 600ps. The instrument is characterised through a set of detailed phantom measurements as well as proof-of-concept in vivo measurements, demonstrating performance comparable with conventional pulsed time-domain near-infrared spectroscopy systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffuse optical imaging", "In-vivo measurement", "Instrument response functions", "Maximum length sequences", "Optical transceiver modules", "Phantom measurements", "Spread spectrum techniques", "Time domain systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048178466", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55357565700": {"Name": "Papadimitriou K.", "AuthorID": "55357565700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56303480500": {"Name": "Dempsey L.", "AuthorID": "56303480500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004407749": {"Name": "Hebden J.", "AuthorID": "7004407749", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7201575253": {"Name": "Powell S.", "AuthorID": "7201575253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
