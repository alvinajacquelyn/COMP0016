However more use of ICT for work during non-work time has been linked with negative outcomes including lower work and life satisfaction and increased stress. Previous work has suggested that in order to reduce some of these negative effects, people should adopt technology use strategies that aid separation of their home and work lives. In this paper we report the results of a questionnaire study investigating work-life balance boundary behaviours and technology use. We find that people use multiple devices as a way of creating boundaries between home and work, and the extent to which they do this relates to their boundary behaviour style. These findings have particular relevance given the increasing trend for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Boundary control", "Bring your own device", "Device separation", "Life-work balance", "Technology boundary work"], "IndexKeywords": ["Boundary behaviour", "Boundary controls", "Boundary works", "Bring your own devices", "Increased flexibility", "Information and Communication Technologies", "Questionnaire studies", "Work-life balance"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951082035", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"8614407000": {"Name": "Fleck R.", "AuthorID": "8614407000", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "HCI Centre, University of Birmingham"}, "23391770800": {"Name": "Cox A.", "AuthorID": "23391770800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Interaction Centre, University College London"}, "56037576900": {"Name": "Robison R.", "AuthorID": "56037576900", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Global Sustainability Institute, Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
