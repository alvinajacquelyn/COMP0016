The FEBS Journal published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Federation of European Biochemical Societies.Severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is most frequently associated with the alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) Z variant (E342K). ZZ homozygotes exhibit accumulation of AAT as polymers in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. This protein deposition can lead to liver disease, with the resulting low circulating levels of AAT predisposing to early-onset emphysema due to dysregulation of elastinolytic activity in the lungs. An increasing number of rare AAT alleles have been identified in patients with severe AATD, typically in combination with the Z allele. Here we report a new mutation (E75V) in a patient with severe plasma deficiency, which we designate Trento. In contrast to the Z mutant, Trento AAT was secreted efficiently when expressed in cellular models but showed compromised conformational stability. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and ELISA-based analyses of the secreted protein revealed the presence of oligomeric species with electrophoretic and immunorecognition profiles different from those of Z and S (E264V) AAT polymers, including reduced recognition by conformational monoclonal antibodies 2C1 and 4B12. This altered recognition was not due to direct effects on the epitope of the 2C1 monoclonal antibody which we localized between helices E and F. Structural analyses indicate the likely basis for polymer formation is the loss of a highly conserved stabilizing interaction between helix C and the posthelix I loop. These results highlight this region as important for maintaining native state stability and, when compromised, results in the formation of pathological polymers that are different from those produced by Z and S AAT.", "AuthorKeywords": ["alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency", "emphysema", "misfolding diseases", "serpin polymers", "serpins"], "IndexKeywords": ["alpha 1-Antitrypsin", "alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency", "Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation", "Mutation", "Polymerization", "Protein Conformation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020304986", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"8377905200": {"Name": "Miranda E.", "AuthorID": "8377905200", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Biotechnologies \u2018Charles Darwin\u2019, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57194469455": {"Name": "Cerea M.", "AuthorID": "57194469455", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia"}, "6506360965": {"Name": "Ferrarotti I.", "AuthorID": "6506360965", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Internal Medicine and Therapeutics, Pneumology Unit, University of Pavia"}, "57190874150": {"Name": "Berardelli R.", "AuthorID": "57190874150", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia"}, "57194471050": {"Name": "Laffranchi M.", "AuthorID": "57194471050", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia"}, "9733566000": {"Name": "Gangemi F.", "AuthorID": "9733566000", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia"}, "6603061500": {"Name": "Fra A.", "AuthorID": "6603061500", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia"}, "35487611700": {"Name": "Haq I.", "AuthorID": "35487611700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory and the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory and the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "26643229900": {"Name": "Irving J.", "AuthorID": "26643229900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory and the Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "24504212400": {"Name": "Ottaviani S.", "AuthorID": "24504212400", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Center for Diagnosis of Inherited Alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency, Pneumology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"}}}
