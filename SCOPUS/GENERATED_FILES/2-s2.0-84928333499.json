With an increasing number of survivors after heart transplantation in children, the complications from long-term immunosuppression, including renal insufficiency, are becoming more apparent. Severe renal dysfunction after heart transplant is defined by a serum creatinine level >2.5 mg/dL (221 \u03bcmol/L), and/or need for dialysis or renal transplant. The degree of renal dysfunction is variable and is progressive over time. About 3\u201310 % of heart transplant recipients will go on to develop severe renal dysfunction within the first 10 years post-transplantation. Multiple risk factors for chronic kidney disease post-transplant have been identified, which include pre-transplant worsening renal function, recipient demographics and morbidity, peri-transplant haemodynamics and long-term exposure to calcineurin inhibitors. Renal insufficiency increases the risk of post-transplant morbidity and mortality. Hence, screening for renal dysfunction pre-, peri- and post-transplantation is important. Early and timely detection of renal insufficiency may help minimize renal insults, and allow prompt implementation of renoprotective strategies. Close monitoring and pre-emptive management of renal dysfunction is an integral aspect of peri-transplant and subsequent post-transplant long-term care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bridging to transplant", "Calcineurin inhibitor", "Chronic kidney disease", "Complications", "Creatinine clearance", "Renal failure", "Renal insufficiency"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Kidney Injury", "Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Calcineurin Inhibitors", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Disease Progression", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Heart Failure", "Heart Transplantation", "Humans", "Immunosuppressive Agents", "Infant", "Kidney Function Tests", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Renal Insufficiency", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928333499", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Nephrology", "MEDI", "2727"]], "AuthorData": {"6507851178": {"Name": "Hoskote A.", "AuthorID": "6507851178", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Intensive Care and ECMO, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005588453": {"Name": "Burch M.", "AuthorID": "7005588453", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
