However, perspectives have changed more recently to acknowledge that screening can lead to harm as well as benefit, and that it is important for service users to consider both. For some types of cancer screening, there is professional contention about whether benefits clearly outweigh harms. In light of this, an emerging trend in cancer screening communication is to try to support informed decision making - that is, to help people understand both the advantages and disadvantages of screening, allowing them to make individual decisions about their screening participation that reflect their informed preferences. In this review, we provide an overview of key theoretical and practical aspects of improving communication and supporting informed decision making about cancer screening, highlight relevant research and discuss future implications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attitude to Health", "Communication", "Decision Making", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Health Education", "Humans", "Medical Overuse", "Quality Improvement"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85026754326", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"35111091600": {"Name": "Hersch J.K.", "AuthorID": "35111091600", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney"}, "56662826100": {"Name": "Nickel B.L.", "AuthorID": "56662826100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney"}, "8383675800": {"Name": "Jansen J.", "AuthorID": "8383675800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney"}, "6603770315": {"Name": "McCaffery K.J.", "AuthorID": "6603770315", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney School of Public Health, University of Sydney"}, "38361424400": {"Name": "Ghanouni A.", "AuthorID": "38361424400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}}}
