Following excitation at 160.8 nm, and subsequent probing via photoionization at 266.45 nm, the initially prepared wave packet is found to exhibit a fast decay (<100 fs) that is attributed to the rapid dissociation of C3H6 to ethylene (C2H4) and methylene (CH2). The photodissociation process proceeds via concerted ring opening and C-C bond cleavage in the excited state. Ab initio multiple spawning simulations indicate that ring-opening occurs prior to dissociation. The dynamics simulations were subsequently employed to simulate a TRPES spectrum, which was found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental result. On the basis of this agreement, the fitted time constants of 35 \u00b1 20 and 57 \u00b1 35 fs were assigned to prompt (i) dissociation on the lowest-lying excited state, prepared directly by the pump pulse, and (ii) non-adiabatic relaxation from higher-lying excited states that lead to delayed dissociation, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio dynamics", "C-c bond cleavages", "Dynamics simulation", "Excited-state dynamics", "Photoinduced dynamics", "Quantum dynamics simulation", "Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy", "Vacuum ultraviolets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054894342", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57204194494": {"Name": "Coates M.R.", "AuthorID": "57204194494", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Ottawa"}, "36967643400": {"Name": "Neville S.P.", "AuthorID": "36967643400", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Sciences, University of Ottawa"}, "7003515475": {"Name": "Stolow A.", "AuthorID": "7003515475", "AffiliationID": "60009839", "AffiliationName": "National Research Council of Canada"}, "12799638200": {"Name": "Schuurman M.S.", "AuthorID": "12799638200", "AffiliationID": "60009839", "AffiliationName": "National Research Council of Canada"}, "56059221200": {"Name": "Larsen M.A.B.", "AuthorID": "56059221200", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen"}, "6701620899": {"Name": "S\u00f8lling T.I.", "AuthorID": "6701620899", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen"}, "57192700246": {"Name": "Forbes R.", "AuthorID": "57192700246", "AffiliationID": "60028897", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Ottawa"}, "55880417400": {"Name": "Boguslavskiy A.E.", "AuthorID": "55880417400", "AffiliationID": "60009839", "AffiliationName": "National Research Council of Canada"}, "6507125141": {"Name": "Lausten R.", "AuthorID": "6507125141", "AffiliationID": "60009839", "AffiliationName": "National Research Council of Canada"}, "35312870200": {"Name": "Wilkinson I.", "AuthorID": "35312870200", "AffiliationID": "60004017", "AffiliationName": "Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f\u00fcr Materialien und Energie GmbH"}}}
