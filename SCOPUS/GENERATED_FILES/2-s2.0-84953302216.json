There is a need to further facilitate the identification of persons at elevated risk in routine practice. Methods and results Prospective information was collected on 32,663 HIV-positive persons from 20 countries in Europe and Australia, who were free of CVD at entry into the Data-collection on Adverse Effects of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) study. Cox regression models (full and reduced) were developed that predict the risk of a global CVD endpoint. The predictive performance of the D:A:D models were compared with a recent CVD prediction model from the Framingham study, which was assessed recalibrated to the D:A:D dataset. A total of 1010 CVD events occurred during 186,364.5 person-years. The full D:A:D CVD prediction model included age, gender, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, family history of CVD, diabetes, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, CD4 lymphocyte count, cumulative exposure to protease- and nucleoside reverse transcriptase-inhibitors, and current use of abacavir. A reduced model omitted antiretroviral therapies. The D:A:D models statistically significantly predicted risk more accurately than the recalibrated Framingham model (Harrell's c-statistic of 0.791, 0.783 and 0.766 for the D:A:D full, D:A:D reduced, and Framingham models respectively; p < 0.001). The D:A:D models also more accurately predicted five-year CVD-risk for key prognostic subgroups. Conclusions An updated, easily recalibrated, global CVD-risk equation tailored to HIV-positive persons was developed using routinely collected CVD risk parameters and incorporating markers on immune function (CD4 lymphocyte count), and exposure to antiretroviral therapies. The estimated CVD risk can be used to quantify risk and to guide preventive care.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AIDS", "CVD risk prediction", "epidemiology", "HIV"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Blood Pressure", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "CD4 Lymphocyte Count", "Cholesterol", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Dideoxynucleosides", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "HIV Infections", "HIV Protease Inhibitors", "Humans", "Lipoproteins, HDL", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Statistical", "Prospective Studies", "Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors", "Risk Assessment", "Sex Factors", "Smoking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953302216", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57201399433": {"Name": "Friis-M\u00f8ller N.", "AuthorID": "57201399433", "AffiliationID": "60015591", "AffiliationName": "Odense University Hospital, Department of Infectious Diseases"}, "54924488100": {"Name": "Ryom L.", "AuthorID": "54924488100", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen HIV Programme, Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, University of Copenhagen"}, "7005723136": {"Name": "Kirk O.", "AuthorID": "7005723136", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen HIV Programme, Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, University of Copenhagen"}, "35307337700": {"Name": "Lundgren J.", "AuthorID": "35307337700", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen HIV Programme, Department of Infectious Diseases and Rheumatology, University of Copenhagen"}, "7501658889": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "7501658889", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "35372648800": {"Name": "Phillips A.", "AuthorID": "35372648800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Infection and Population Health, UCL"}, "7403384313": {"Name": "Weber R.", "AuthorID": "7403384313", "AffiliationID": "60019619, 60012614", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "7005073010": {"Name": "Reiss P.", "AuthorID": "7005073010", "AffiliationID": "60002483, 60172322, 60001157", "AffiliationName": "Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Stichting HIV Monitoring"}, "7101905261": {"Name": "Dabis F.", "AuthorID": "7101905261", "AffiliationID": "60102125", "AffiliationName": "University of Bordeaux, ISPED"}, "35398225800": {"Name": "De Wit S.", "AuthorID": "35398225800", "AffiliationID": "60029852", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire St Pierre Hospital"}, "34572443100": {"Name": "Monforte A.D.A.", "AuthorID": "34572443100", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Hospital San Paolo, University of Milan"}, "55929883100": {"Name": "Fontas E.", "AuthorID": "55929883100", "AffiliationID": "60030964", "AffiliationName": "Department de Sant\u00e9 Publique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice"}, "55556254800": {"Name": "Law M.", "AuthorID": "55556254800", "AffiliationID": "60026655, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "0 the Kirby Institute, University of New South Wales"}}}
