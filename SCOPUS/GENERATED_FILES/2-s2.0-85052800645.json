Methods: One hundred forty-two eyes of 132 patients underwent pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling, and gas tamponade in a 60-month time frame. Anatomical success and FL rates assessed by spectral domain optical coherence tomography, mean preoperative, and postoperative best-measured visual acuity and surgical details were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Spectral domain optical coherence tomography confirmed closed holes with FL in 33.7% (34/101) of eyes at 1 month, 7.3% (9/123) at 3 months, 4.6% (6/129) at 6 months, and 3% (4/133) at 12 months. Prevalence of FL in closed holes at Month 1 was lower in C3F8-treated eyes (9.5%, 2/21) compared with C2F6 (40.9%, 18/44, P = 0.03) and SF6-treated eyes (38.9%, 14/36, P = 0.05). No differences were observed at Month 3. No differences in best-measured visual acuity change were observed between closed holes with or without FL at Month 1 (20.14 \u00b1 0.19 vs. 20.11 \u00b1 0.23, P = 0.48) or any of the other time points. Conclusion: Temporary FL is a highly prevalent feature in successfully closed macular holes. Eyes treated with C3F8 gas had lower rates of FL at Month 1 than C2F6 and SF6-treated eyes. The presence of FL in closed holes does not seem to have any effect on the visual outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Basement Membrane", "Contrast Media", "Endotamponade", "Female", "Fluorocarbons", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fovea Centralis", "Humans", "Male", "Prevalence", "Retinal Perforations", "Retrospective Studies", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Treatment Outcome", "Visual Acuity", "Vitrectomy"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052800645", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"24725877200": {"Name": "Zarranz-Ventura J.", "AuthorID": "24725877200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR, Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "54408319800": {"Name": "Ellabban A.A.", "AuthorID": "54408319800", "AffiliationID": "60020322", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Suez Canal University"}, "57220674986": {"Name": "Kirkpatrick J.N.", "AuthorID": "57220674986", "AffiliationID": "60002465, 60021179", "AffiliationName": "Vitreo-Retinal Service, Cheltenham General Hospital, Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "14830758300": {"Name": "Sallam A.A.B.", "AuthorID": "14830758300", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "Jones Eye Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Science"}, "22958698000": {"Name": "Sim D.A.", "AuthorID": "22958698000", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR, Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24480921100": {"Name": "Keane P.A.", "AuthorID": "24480921100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR, Biomedical Research Centre for Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
