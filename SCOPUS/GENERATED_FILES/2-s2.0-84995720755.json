One commonly proposed measure is the binaural interaction component (BIC), which is obtained typically by recording auditory brainstem responses (ABRs)-the BIC reflects the difference between the binaural ABR and the sum of the monaural ABRs (i.e., binaural - (left + right)). We have recently developed an alternative, direct measure of sensitivity to interaural time differences, namely, a following response to modulations in interaural phase difference (the interaural phase modulation following response; IPM-FR). To obtain this measure, an ongoing diotically amplitude-modulated signal is presented, and the interaural phase difference of the carrier is switched periodically at minima in the modulation cycle. Such periodic modulations to interaural phase difference can evoke a steady state following response. BIC and IPM-FR measurements were compared from 10 normal-hearing subjects using a 16-channel electroencephalographic system. Both ABRs and IPM-FRs were observed most clearly from similar electrode locations-differential recordings taken from electrodes near the ear (e.g., mastoid) in reference to a vertex electrode (Cz). Although all subjects displayed clear ABRs, the BIC was not reliably observed. In contrast, the IPM-FR typically elicited a robust and significant response. In addition, the IPM-FR measure required a considerably shorter recording session. As the IPM-FR magnitude varied with interaural phase difference modulation depth, it could potentially serve as a correlate of perceptual salience. Overall, the IPM-FR appears a more suitable clinical measure than the BIC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["auditory brainstem responses", "auditory steady-state responses", "binaural processing", "electroencephalography", "interaural time differences"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Electroencephalography", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem", "Female", "Healthy Volunteers", "Humans", "Male", "Reaction Time", "Reference Values", "Sound Localization", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995720755", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"36650572300": {"Name": "Haywood N.R.", "AuthorID": "36650572300", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "36198983500": {"Name": "Undurraga J.A.", "AuthorID": "36198983500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "16425864500": {"Name": "Marquardt T.", "AuthorID": "16425864500", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences, University College London"}, "7005917811": {"Name": "McAlpine D.", "AuthorID": "7005917811", "AffiliationID": "60011326, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences, University College London"}}}
