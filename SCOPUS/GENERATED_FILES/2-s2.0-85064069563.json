This suggests that auroral processes and the neutral stratosphere of Jupiter are coupled; however, the exact nature of this coupling is unknown. Here we present a time series of Subaru-COMICS images of Jupiter measured at a wavelength of 7.80 \u03bcm on 11\u201314 January, 4\u20135 February and 17\u201320 May 2017. These data show that both the morphology and magnitude of the auroral CH4 emission vary on daily timescales in relation to external solar-wind conditions. The southern auroral CH4 emission increased in brightness temperature by about 3.8 K between 15:50 ut, 11 January and 12:57 ut, 12 January, during a predicted solar-wind compression. During the same compression, the northern auroral emission exhibited a duskside brightening, which mimics the morphology observed in the ultraviolet auroral emission during periods of enhanced solar-wind pressure4,5. These results suggest that changes in external solar-wind conditions perturb the Jovian magnetosphere in such a way that energetic particles are accelerated into the planet\u2019s atmosphere, deposit their energy as deep as the neutral stratosphere, and modify the thermal structure, the abundance of CH4 or the population of energy states of CH4. We also find that the northern and southern auroral CH4 emission evolved independently between the January, February and May images, as has been observed at X-ray wavelengths over shorter timescales6 and at mid-infrared wavelengths over longer timescales7.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064069563", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"54905509500": {"Name": "Sinclair J.", "AuthorID": "54905509500", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "7005251447": {"Name": "Orton G.", "AuthorID": "7005251447", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "57195241114": {"Name": "Fernandes J.", "AuthorID": "57195241114", "AffiliationID": "60029378", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, California State University"}, "56204153300": {"Name": "Giles R.", "AuthorID": "56204153300", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "55552765000": {"Name": "Tabataba-Vakili F.", "AuthorID": "55552765000", "AffiliationID": "60009037, 60031581", "AffiliationName": "Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology"}, "6603375632": {"Name": "Kasaba Y.", "AuthorID": "6603375632", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Planetary Plasma and Atmospheric Research Center, Tohoku University"}, "57199426611": {"Name": "Sato T.", "AuthorID": "57199426611", "AffiliationID": "60006103", "AffiliationName": "Space Information Center, Hokkaido Information University"}, "7007041851": {"Name": "Fujiyoshi T.", "AuthorID": "7007041851", "AffiliationID": "60029701", "AffiliationName": "Subaru Telescope, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan"}, "15751927000": {"Name": "Tao C.", "AuthorID": "15751927000", "AffiliationID": "60032325", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Information and Communications Technology"}, "36163720700": {"Name": "Vogt M.", "AuthorID": "36163720700", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Center for Space Physics, Boston University"}, "8286503700": {"Name": "Grodent D.", "AuthorID": "8286503700", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, STAR Institute, Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire"}, "16425277400": {"Name": "Bonfond B.", "AuthorID": "16425277400", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge, STAR Institute, Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire"}, "57203104329": {"Name": "Moses J.", "AuthorID": "57203104329", "AffiliationID": "60030389", "AffiliationName": "Space Science Institute"}, "6603118817": {"Name": "Greathouse T.", "AuthorID": "6603118817", "AffiliationID": "60011533", "AffiliationName": "Southwest Research Institute"}, "57188586429": {"Name": "Dunn W.", "AuthorID": "57188586429", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Space and Climate Physics, University College London"}, "12647363200": {"Name": "Fletcher L.", "AuthorID": "12647363200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "7101824727": {"Name": "Irwin P.", "AuthorID": "7101824727", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford"}}}
