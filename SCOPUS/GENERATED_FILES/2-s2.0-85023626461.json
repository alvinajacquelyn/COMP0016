All rights reserved.The conversion of oxygen-rich biomass into hydrocarbon fuels requires efficient hydrodeoxygenation catalysts during the upgrading process. However, traditionally prepared CoMoS2 catalysts, although efficient for hydrodesulfurization, are not appropriate due to their poor activity, sulfur loss and rapid deactivation at elevated temperature. Here, we report the synthesis of MoS2 monolayer sheets decorated with isolated Co atoms that bond covalently to sulfur vacancies on the basal planes that, when compared with conventionally prepared samples, exhibit superior activity, selectivity and stability for the hydrodeoxygenation of 4-methylphenol to toluene. This higher activity allows the reaction temperature to be reduced from the typically used 300 \u00b0C to 180 \u00b0C and thus allows the catalysis to proceed without sulfur loss and deactivation. Experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal a large number of sites at the interface between the Co and Mo atoms on the MoS2 basal surface and we ascribe the higher activity to the presence of sulfur vacancies that are created local to the observed Co-S-Mo interfacial sites.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023626461", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"57188720022": {"Name": "Liu G.", "AuthorID": "57188720022", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Catalysis Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "56796875200": {"Name": "Li M.M.J.", "AuthorID": "56796875200", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Catalysis Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "56438799400": {"Name": "Kuo W.C.H.", "AuthorID": "56438799400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Catalysis Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "7102255904": {"Name": "Tsang S.C.E.", "AuthorID": "7102255904", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Catalysis Centre, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "55962883000": {"Name": "Robertson A.W.", "AuthorID": "55962883000", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "55163531500": {"Name": "Warner J.H.", "AuthorID": "55163531500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, University of Oxford"}, "57102931200": {"Name": "Darby M.T.", "AuthorID": "57102931200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57195227314": {"Name": "Muhieddine M.H.", "AuthorID": "57195227314", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004483530": {"Name": "Stamatakis M.", "AuthorID": "7004483530", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175885", "AffiliationName": "Thomas Young Centre, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56324654100": {"Name": "Lin Y.C.", "AuthorID": "56324654100", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)"}, "35602073000": {"Name": "Suenaga K.", "AuthorID": "35602073000", "AffiliationID": "60024621", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST)"}}}
