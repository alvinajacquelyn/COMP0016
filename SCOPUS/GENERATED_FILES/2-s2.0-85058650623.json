We evaluate the system performance of a multiband carrier-less amplitude and phase (m-CAP) modulation scheme for a range of FSO/VLC link lengths and m-CAP parameters (i.e., the roll-off factor of the filters and a number of subcarriers) in terms of the data rate Rb (i.e., spectral efficiency). We show that for the configuration with a 1-m VLC link the 10-CAP offers more than a 40% improvement in the measured Rb compared to 2-CAP for the same bit error rate target. The Rb penalty due to the extension of a VLC-link span from 1 to 3 m reaches to 12.6 Mb/s for the 10-CAP scheme (i.e., \u223c39% degradation in Rb). To fully cover all aspects of the hybrid FSO/VLC system, we also investigate the atmospheric turbulence effect on the 500-m FSO link where Rb is decreased by 30% for the refractive index structure parameter Cn 2 of 2.4 \u00d7 10-15 m-2/3 compared to a clear channel condition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["free space optics", "multiband carrier-less amplitude and phase modulation", "Visible light communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric turbulence effects", "Bandwidth bottlenecks", "Free space optics", "Free-space optical", "Modulation schemes", "Multiband carriers", "Refractive index structure parameter", "Spectral efficiencies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058650623", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56373334300": {"Name": "Pesek P.", "AuthorID": "56373334300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "6508134236": {"Name": "Chvojka P.", "AuthorID": "6508134236", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, NCRLab, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
