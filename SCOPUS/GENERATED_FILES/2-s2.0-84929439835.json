Methods: A search was conducted for randomised controlled trials involving tDCS and rehabilitation for the upper extremity in stroke. Quality of included studies was analysed using the Modified Downs and Black form. The extent of, and effect of variation in treatment parameters such as anodal, cathodal and bi-hemispheric tDCS on upper extremity outcome measures of impairment and activity were analysed using meta-analysis. Results: Nine studies (371 participants with acute, sub-acute and chronic stroke) were included. Different methodologies of tDCS and upper extremity intervention, outcome measures and timing of assessments were identified. Real tDCS combined with rehabilitation had a small non-significant effect of +0.11 (p = 0.44) and +0.24 (p = 0.11) on upper extremity impairments and activities at post-intervention respectively. Conclusion: Various tDCS methods have been used in stroke rehabilitation. The evidence so far is not statistically significant, but is suggestive of, at best, a small beneficial effect on upper extremity impairment. Significance: Future research should focus on which patients and rehabilitation programmes are likely to respond to different tDCS regimes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Non-invasive brain stimulation", "Recovery", "Rehabilitation", "Stroke", "Transcranial direct current stimulation", "Upper extremity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Activities of Daily Living", "Humans", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Recovery of Function", "Stroke", "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation", "Upper Extremity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929439835", "SubjectAreas": [["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55839351800": {"Name": "Tedesco Triccas L.", "AuthorID": "55839351800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7004375748": {"Name": "Burridge J.H.", "AuthorID": "7004375748", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "16039464000": {"Name": "Hughes A.M.", "AuthorID": "16039464000", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "7007021758": {"Name": "Pickering R.M.", "AuthorID": "7007021758", "AffiliationID": "60025287", "AffiliationName": "Medical Statistics Group, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton"}, "50060943300": {"Name": "Desikan M.", "AuthorID": "50060943300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College of London"}, "55455767400": {"Name": "Rothwell J.C.", "AuthorID": "55455767400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College of London"}, "10640975800": {"Name": "Verheyden G.", "AuthorID": "10640975800", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences"}}}
