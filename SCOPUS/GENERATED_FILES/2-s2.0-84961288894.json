The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, and 40 newer regions identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and dense fine mapping, account for \u030340% of the disease heritability. We hypothesized that in pedigrees with multiple individuals with CeD rare [minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.5%] mutations of larger effect siz (odds ratios of \u0303 2-5) might exist. We sequenced the exomes of 75 coeliac individuals of European ancestry from 55 multiply affected families. We selected interesting variants and genes for further follow up using a combination of: an assessment of shared variants between related subjects, a model-free linkage test, and gene burden tests for multiple, potentially causal,variants. We next performed highly multiplexed amplicon resequencing of all RefSeq exons from 24 candidate genes selected on the basis of the exome sequencing data in 2,248 unrelated coeliac cases and 2,230 controls. 1,335 variants with a 99.9% genotyping call rate were observed in 4,478 samples, of which 939 were present in coding regions of 24 genes (Ti/Tv 2.99). 91.7% of coding variants were rare (MAF <0.5%) and 60% were novel. Gene burden tests performed on rare functional variants identified no significant associations (p<1\u00d710?3) in the resequenced candidate genes. Our strategy of sequencing multiply affected families with deep follow up of candidate genes has not identified any new CeD risk mutations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Case-Control Studies", "Celiac Disease", "Exome", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Linkage", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Male", "Pedigree", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Sequence Analysis, DNA"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961288894", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57208477661": {"Name": "Mistry V.", "AuthorID": "57208477661", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "23987785500": {"Name": "Bockett N.A.", "AuthorID": "23987785500", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57197038575": {"Name": "Hunt K.A.", "AuthorID": "57197038575", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "6603786839": {"Name": "Van Heel D.A.", "AuthorID": "6603786839", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "37063339800": {"Name": "Levine A.P.", "AuthorID": "37063339800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7102855185": {"Name": "Mirza M.M.", "AuthorID": "7102855185", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Advanced Diagnostics, Molecular Profiling Laboratory, Sarah Cannon-UCL Laboratories"}, "7004331297": {"Name": "Ciclitira P.J.", "AuthorID": "7004331297", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Division of Diabetes and Nutritional Sciences, Gastroenterology, The Rayne Institute, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "6602200069": {"Name": "Hummerich H.", "AuthorID": "6602200069", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Prion Unit, Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "23024609100": {"Name": "Neuhausen S.L.", "AuthorID": "23024609100", "AffiliationID": "60007474", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Sciences, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope"}, "55605775809": {"Name": "Simpson M.A.", "AuthorID": "55605775809", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Kings College London School of Medicine, Guy's Hospital"}, "16402494600": {"Name": "Plagnol V.", "AuthorID": "16402494600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Genetics Institute"}}}
