Methods: Multicentre cohort study of 16\u201370-year-olds admitted to 4 UK hospitals following injury. Psychological morbidity and HRQoL (EQ-5D-3L) were measured at recruitment and 1, 2, 4 and 12 months post-injury. A reduction in EQ-5D compared to retrospectively assessed pre-injury levels of at least 0.074 was taken as the minimal important difference (MID). Multilevel logistic regression explored relationships between psychological morbidity 1 month post-injury and MID in HRQoL over the 12 months after injury. Results: A total of 668 adults participated. Follow-up rates were 77% (1 month) and 63% (12 months). Substantial reductions in HRQoL were seen; 93% reported a MID at 1 month and 58% at 12 months. Problems with pain, mobility and usual activities were commonly reported at each time point. Depression and anxiety scores 1 month post-injury were independently associated with subsequent MID in HRQoL. The relationship between depression and HRQoL was partly explained by anxiety and to a lesser extent by pain and social functioning. The relationship between anxiety and HRQoL was not explained by factors measured in our study. Conclusions: Hospitalised injuries result in substantial reductions in HRQoL up to 12 months later. Depression and anxiety early in the recovery period are independently associated with lower HRQoL. Identifying and managing these problems, ensuring adequate pain control and facilitating social functioning are key elements in improving HRQoL post-injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Cohort study", "Depression", "Quality of life", "Unintentional injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Anxiety", "Cohort Studies", "Depression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Morbidity", "Sickness Impact Profile", "Wounds and Injuries", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992336065", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7006870304": {"Name": "Kendrick D.", "AuthorID": "7006870304", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham"}, "7003598940": {"Name": "Coupland C.", "AuthorID": "7003598940", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham"}, "55810399100": {"Name": "Maula A.", "AuthorID": "55810399100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care, University of Nottingham"}, "25931569700": {"Name": "Kelllezi B.", "AuthorID": "25931569700", "AffiliationID": "60006029", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology, Nottingham Trent University"}, "55928549900": {"Name": "Beckett K.", "AuthorID": "55928549900", "AffiliationID": "60019611", "AffiliationName": "Research and Innovation, University of the West of England"}, "7004056331": {"Name": "Morriss R.", "AuthorID": "7004056331", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, University of Nottingham"}, "34770520100": {"Name": "Joseph S.", "AuthorID": "34770520100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Education, University of Nottingham"}, "55415843900": {"Name": "Barnes J.", "AuthorID": "55415843900", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Loughborough Design School, Loughborough University"}, "23111755700": {"Name": "Sleney J.", "AuthorID": "23111755700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sociology, University of Surrey"}, "57210406972": {"Name": "Christie N.", "AuthorID": "57210406972", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Transport Studies, University College London"}}}
