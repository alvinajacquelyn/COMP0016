Based on the cubature method of Lyons and Victoir (2004), the algorithm is deterministic differing from the usual methods based on interacting particles. It can be parametrized in order to obtain a given order of convergence. Then, we construct implementable algorithms to solve decoupled Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential equations (FBSDE) of McKean-Vlasov type, which appear in some stochastic control problems in a mean field environment. We give two algorithms and show that they have convergence of order one and two under appropriate regularity conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BSDE", "Cubature", "McKean-Vlasov processes", "Mean field games", "Non-local", "PDE"], "IndexKeywords": ["BSDE", "Cubature", "Forward-backward stochastic differential equations", "Interacting particles", "Mean field games", "Nonlocal", "Regularity condition", "Stochastic control"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939947479", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56502415100": {"Name": "Chaudru De Raynal P.E.", "AuthorID": "56502415100", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60110369", "AffiliationName": "Universite Nice Sophia Antipolis, Laboratoire Jean-Alexandre Dieudonne"}, "56502426100": {"Name": "Garcia Trillos C.A.", "AuthorID": "56502426100", "AffiliationID": "60110693, 60110369", "AffiliationName": "Universite Nice Sophia Antipolis, Laboratoire Jean-Alexandre Dieudonne"}}}
