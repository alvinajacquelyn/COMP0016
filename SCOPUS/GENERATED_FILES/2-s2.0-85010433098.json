It is thus crucial to assess the damage caused to such materials by cosmic rays and neutrons, which pose a variety of hazards through atomic displacements following neutron-nucleus collisions. Here we report the first study of the neutron radiation tolerance of two poly(thiophene)s-based organic semiconductors: poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl), P3HT, and the liquid-crystalline poly(2,5-bis (3-tetradecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene), PBTTT. We combine spectroscopic investigations with characterisation of intrinsic charge mobility to show that PBTTT exhibits significantly higher tolerance than P3HT. We explain this in terms of a superior chemical, structural and conformational stability of PBTTT, which can be ascribed to its higher crystallinity, in turn induced by a combination of molecular design features. Our approach can be used to develop design strategies for better neutron radiation-tolerant materials, thus paving the way for organic semiconductors to enter avionics and space applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010433098", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55914397200": {"Name": "Patern\u00f2 G.M.", "AuthorID": "55914397200", "AffiliationID": "60023256, 60102151", "AffiliationName": "Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Center for Nano Science and Technology and Polimi"}, "55668072300": {"Name": "Robbiano V.", "AuthorID": "55668072300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57193059150": {"Name": "Fraser K.J.", "AuthorID": "57193059150", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101816954": {"Name": "Frost C.", "AuthorID": "7101816954", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "11539776500": {"Name": "Garci\u00e1 Sakai V.", "AuthorID": "11539776500", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Pulsed Neutron and Muon Source, Science and Technology Facilities Council, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}}}
