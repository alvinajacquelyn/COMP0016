In most recent implementations, these effects are compensated for at the receiver by complex adaptive MIMO equalizers. Although frequency-domain MIMO equalization requires a moderate complexity compared to time-domain equalization, the long required FFTs may face implementation issues and yield a relatively slow response to dynamic effects. In this paper, we evaluate an alternate transceiver architecture based on sub-band partitioning, implemented by filter banks, which enables concurrent time-domain equalization. The performance of sub-band and single-carrier schemes are compared using Monte-Carlo simulations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MIMO equalization", "space-division multiplexing", "sub-band partitioning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Differential Mode Delays", "Frequency domains", "MIMO equalization", "Moderate complexity", "Space division multiplexing", "Subbands", "Time domain equalization", "Transceiver architecture"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85031022728", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"]], "AuthorData": {"57188740563": {"Name": "Santos L.", "AuthorID": "57188740563", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "55203915600": {"Name": "Mello D.", "AuthorID": "55203915600", "AffiliationID": "60029570", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)"}, "34881593800": {"Name": "Ferreira F.", "AuthorID": "34881593800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies, Aston University"}}}
