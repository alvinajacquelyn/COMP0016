Materials and methods Questionnaires were distributed to pre-surgical patients at two centres (United Kingdom and Switzerland); questions asked what patients wished to gain from orthognathic treatment and how confident they were that they would be satisfied with treatment outcome. Gender, age and location were recorded as demographic variables, and type of malocclusion was also recorded. Results A total of 202 questionnaires were returned (UK, n = 149; Switzerland, n = 53). Reported motivating factors focused on improvements in aesthetics (specified and unspecified) (UK vs. Switzerland: 91.3% vs. 83.0%), function (72.5% vs. 66.0%), psychosocial health (51.7% vs. 20.8%), speech (4.0% vs. 7.5%), alleviation of pain (5.4% vs. 17%) and normalization of breathing (1.3% vs. 7.5%). No significant relationships were observed relative to patient age, gender or malocclusion. The anticipated satisfaction levels were generally high (86.5% vs. 89.9%). Conclusion Although the distribution of motivational factors varied between the two sites, it did not affect the anticipated satisfaction level. Patients were generally confident that they would be satisfied with their treatment outcome and that their reasons for seeking treatment would be addressed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Audit", "Confidence", "Demographics", "Motivation", "Orthognathic surgery", "Satisfaction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Orthognathic Surgical Procedures", "Patient Satisfaction", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Switzerland", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018622653", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"54795565600": {"Name": "Patcas R.", "AuthorID": "54795565600", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Orthodontics and Paediatric Dentistry, Centre for Dental Medicine, University of Zurich"}, "7201937126": {"Name": "Cunningham S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201937126", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194075988": {"Name": "Arjomand L.", "AuthorID": "57194075988", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55491697800": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "55491697800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Orthodontics, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "14056940800": {"Name": "Shute J.", "AuthorID": "14056940800", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102190114": {"Name": "Lloyd T.", "AuthorID": "7102190114", "AffiliationID": "60013985, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Division of Growth and Development, Eastman Dental Hospital, University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701493721": {"Name": "Obwegeser J.A.", "AuthorID": "6701493721", "AffiliationID": "60002695", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Children's Hospital Zurich"}}}
