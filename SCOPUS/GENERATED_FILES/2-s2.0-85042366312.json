We used it to obtain a dimethylated version of poly(caprolactone) (PdmCL) from dimethylated MDO (DMMDO). First, we revisited monomer synthesis and achieved a milder synthetic protocol by introducing a cobalt-based catalyst. We also developed a new route towards DMMDO via a cyclic carbonate using the Petasis chemistry. Amphiphilic block-copolymers were then generated by free radical polymerization of DMMDO with a PEG-based macroinitiator. The resulting polyesters self-assembled into nanoparticles that were biodegradable as well as biocompatible. The nanoparticles proved to be an effective protective shell for an entrapped enzyme that was released upon degradation of the polyester by esterase. We are confident that our results will spur further research into block-copolymers resulting from RROP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amplex Red", "Biodegradable", "Cyclic ketene acetal", "Radical ring opening polymerization", "Self-assembly"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amphiphilic block copolymers", "Amplex red", "Biodegradable", "Biodegradable nanoparticle", "Cobalt-based catalysts", "Cyclic ketene acetals", "Radical ring opening polymerization", "Synthetic protocols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042366312", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"26221693700": {"Name": "Gaitzsch J.", "AuthorID": "26221693700", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of BaselDepartment of Chemistry"}, "57200756125": {"Name": "Welsch P.", "AuthorID": "57200756125", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of BaselDepartment of Chemistry"}, "57200751905": {"Name": "Folini J.", "AuthorID": "57200751905", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of BaselDepartment of Chemistry"}, "6701689579": {"Name": "Schoenenberger C.", "AuthorID": "6701689579", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of BaselDepartment of Chemistry"}, "57203196605": {"Name": "Meier W.", "AuthorID": "57203196605", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "University of BaselDepartment of Chemistry"}, "55553734284": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55553734284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College LondonDepartment of Chemistry"}}}
