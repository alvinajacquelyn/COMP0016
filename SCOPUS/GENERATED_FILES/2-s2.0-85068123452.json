The increasing amount of plastic solid waste (PSW) in landfills has raised serious concern worldwide for the most effective treatment. Thermochemical post-treatment processes, such as pyrolysis, seem to be the most appropriate method to treat this type of waste in an effective manner. This is because such processes lead to the production of useful chemicals, or hydrocarbon oil of high calorific value (i.e. bio-oil in the case of pyrolysis). LCA appears to be the most appropriate tool for the process design from an environmental context. However, addressed limitations including initial assumptions, functional unit and system boundaries, as well as lack of regional database and exclusion of socio-economic aspects, may hinder the final decision. This review aims to address the benefits of pyrolysis as a method for PSW treatment and raise the limitations and gaps of conducted research via an environmental standpoint.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Energy", "LCA", "Plastics", "Pyrolysis", "Recycling", "Sustainable Management"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy", "Environmental burdens", "Environmental contexts", "Environmental standpoint", "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)", "Post-treatment process", "Socioeconomic aspects", "Sustainable management", "Conservation of Natural Resources", "Plastics", "Recycling", "Solid Waste", "Waste Disposal Facilities", "Waste Management"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068123452", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Pollution", "ENVI", "2310"]], "AuthorData": {"57193804920": {"Name": "Antelava A.", "AuthorID": "57193804920", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering, School of Engineering, London South Bank University"}, "57203246837": {"Name": "Hafeez S.", "AuthorID": "57203246837", "AffiliationID": "60031237", "AffiliationName": "Division of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering, School of Engineering, London South Bank University"}, "35558454600": {"Name": "Constantinou A.", "AuthorID": "35558454600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "57209100691": {"Name": "Damilos S.", "AuthorID": "57209100691", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "7004913362": {"Name": "Manos G.", "AuthorID": "7004913362", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London (UCL)"}, "21741893000": {"Name": "Al-Salem S.M.", "AuthorID": "21741893000", "AffiliationID": "60040278", "AffiliationName": "Environment & Life Sciences Research Centre, Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research"}, "7403255775": {"Name": "Sharma B.K.", "AuthorID": "7403255775", "AffiliationID": "60110563, 60110549, 60000745", "AffiliationName": "Illinois Sustainable Technology Center, Prairie Research Institute, University of Illinois"}, "57132356900": {"Name": "Kohli K.", "AuthorID": "57132356900", "AffiliationID": "60110563, 60110549, 60000745", "AffiliationName": "Illinois Sustainable Technology Center, Prairie Research Institute, University of Illinois"}}}
