The present study aimed to develop an explanatory model for the meanings of material objects to older adults in the context of a residential transition. Method: Using grounded theory methodology, 12 participants were interviewed about the meanings and roles of valued material objects following a residential transition. Older adult participants lived in either their own home or a care home. Results: The model entails two core categories, \u201cthreats to identity\u201d and \u201cobjects and identity continuity\u201d along with four explanatory concepts, \u201cmoving and identity discontinuity\u201d, \u201cconnections across time\u201d, \u201cattachments to others\u201d, and \u201cpreserving self and ancestors in the memories of the next generation\u201d. Discussion: Objects were described to have important personal meanings which helped people maintain a sense of identity continuity following residential transition. They were associated with comfort, security and life review processes, which support identity continuity later in life. Conclusion: Moving house later in life can threaten a person\u2019s sense of self. However, material objects can help maintain a sense of identity continuity through reminiscence and life review processes. Implications for community and residential care moving house transitions are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064481468", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"57208326048": {"Name": "Stevens D.", "AuthorID": "57208326048", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Institute for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "35267762400": {"Name": "Camic P.M.", "AuthorID": "35267762400", "AffiliationID": "60019444", "AffiliationName": "Salomons Institute for Applied Psychology, Canterbury Christ Church University"}, "56488095700": {"Name": "Solway R.", "AuthorID": "56488095700", "AffiliationID": "60176016", "AffiliationName": "Kent Clinical Neuropsychology Service, Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust"}}}
