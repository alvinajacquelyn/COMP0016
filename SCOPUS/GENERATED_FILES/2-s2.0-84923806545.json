We find that although the NQEs significantly change the free-energies of the competing solid and liquid phases, the melting temperature (Tm) is lowered by only \u223c15 K, with values obtained using both classical and quantum nuclei in close proximity to a new experiment. Besides this, a substantial narrowing of the solid/liquid free-energy differences close to Tm was observed, in alignment with a tendency that glassy states might form upon rapid cooling. This tendency was demonstrated by the dynamics of crystallization in the two-phase simulations, which helps to reconcile an important conflict between two recent experiments. This study presents a simple picture for the phase diagram of lithium under pressure. It also indicates that claims on the influence of NQEs on phase diagrams should be carefully made and the method adopted offers a robust solution for such quantitative analyses.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Close proximity", "Free-energy difference", "High pressure melting", "Nuclear quantum effects", "Path-integral molecular dynamics", "Robust solutions", "Thermodynamic integration", "Two-phase simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923806545", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55203728300": {"Name": "Feng Y.", "AuthorID": "55203728300", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Quantum Materials, School of Physics, Peking University"}, "55642062800": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "55642062800", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "International Center for Quantum Materials, School of Physics, Peking University"}, "35722170400": {"Name": "Li X.Z.", "AuthorID": "35722170400", "AffiliationID": "114020962", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter"}, "7403414156": {"Name": "Wang E.", "AuthorID": "7403414156", "AffiliationID": "114020962", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Quantum Matter"}, "7004035504": {"Name": "Alf\u00e8 D.", "AuthorID": "7004035504", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
