Syntax published by John Wiley & Sons LtdA recurring hypothesis about the agreement phenomena generalized as closest-conjunct agreement takes this pattern to result from reduced clausal conjunction, simply displaying the agreement of the verb with the nonconjoined subject of the clause whose content survives ellipsis (Aoun, Benmamoun & Sportiche 1994, 1999; see also Wilder 1997). Closest-conjunct agreement is the dominant agreement pattern in the South Slavic languages Slovenian and Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian. A natural question is whether closest-conjunct agreement in these varieties may indeed be analyzed as entirely derived from conjunction reduction. In this article, we report on two experiments conducted to test this. The results reject the hypothesis as far as these languages are concerned, thereby upholding the relevance of models developed to account for closest-conjunct agreement within theories of agreement.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064003709", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"25222642500": {"Name": "Arsenijevi\u0107 B.", "AuthorID": "25222642500", "AffiliationID": "60022457", "AffiliationName": "University of Graz, Institut f\u00fcr Slawistik"}, "56589999500": {"Name": "Willer-Gold J.", "AuthorID": "56589999500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences"}, "23025748800": {"Name": "Nevins A.", "AuthorID": "23025748800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences"}, "57208164596": {"Name": "Aljovi\u0107 N.", "AuthorID": "57208164596", "AffiliationID": "60122088", "AffiliationName": "University of Zenica, Department of English Language and Literature"}, "57200628132": {"Name": "\u010cordalija N.", "AuthorID": "57200628132", "AffiliationID": "60068811", "AffiliationName": "University of Sarajevo, Department of English, Faculty of Philosophy"}, "24387981000": {"Name": "Leko N.", "AuthorID": "24387981000", "AffiliationID": "60068811", "AffiliationName": "University of Sarajevo, Department of English, Faculty of Philosophy"}, "57208164790": {"Name": "Kresi\u0107 Vukosav M.", "AuthorID": "57208164790", "AffiliationID": "60017028", "AffiliationName": "University of Zadar, Department of Linguistics"}, "55774500600": {"Name": "Malenica F.", "AuthorID": "55774500600", "AffiliationID": "60017028", "AffiliationName": "University of Zadar, Department of English Language and Literature"}, "15118977800": {"Name": "Maru\u0161i\u010d F.", "AuthorID": "15118977800", "AffiliationID": "60025254", "AffiliationName": "University of Nova Gorica, Center for Cognitive Science of Language"}, "57194163037": {"Name": "Mi\u0161ma\u0161 P.", "AuthorID": "57194163037", "AffiliationID": "60025254", "AffiliationName": "University of Nova Gorica, Center for Cognitive Science of Language"}, "55256211900": {"Name": "Mili\u0107ev T.", "AuthorID": "55256211900", "AffiliationID": "60068801", "AffiliationName": "University of Novi Sad, Department of English Studies, Faculty of Philosophy"}, "54891914800": {"Name": "Mili\u0107evi\u0107 N.", "AuthorID": "54891914800", "AffiliationID": "60068801", "AffiliationName": "University of Novi Sad, Department of English Studies, Faculty of Philosophy"}, "57200626466": {"Name": "Miti\u0107 I.", "AuthorID": "57200626466", "AffiliationID": "60068806", "AffiliationName": "University of Ni\u0161, Department for Serbian Language, Faculty of Philosophy"}, "57194833143": {"Name": "Stankovi\u0107 B.", "AuthorID": "57194833143", "AffiliationID": "60068806", "AffiliationName": "University of Ni\u0161, Department for Serbian Language, Faculty of Philosophy"}, "53980318300": {"Name": "Peti-Stanti\u0107 A.", "AuthorID": "53980318300", "AffiliationID": "60008408", "AffiliationName": "University of Zagreb, Department of South Slavic Languages and Literatures, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences"}, "57200628645": {"Name": "Tu\u0161ek J.", "AuthorID": "57200628645", "AffiliationID": "60008408", "AffiliationName": "University of Zagreb, Department of South Slavic Languages and Literatures, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences"}}}
