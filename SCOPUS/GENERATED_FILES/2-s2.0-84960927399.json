While remapping is thought to occur whenever there is tactile input, research has focused on a special case, the crossed-hands deficit, where tactile localization is impaired when the limbs are crossed compared with uncrossed. To date, these studies have always stimulated portions of the limbs that are crossed, such as a finger of each hand. It is therefore unknown whether the deficit induced by arm crossing is specific to the crossed portion of the limb or affects the limb as a whole. In Experiments 1 and 2, we stimulated the shoulders and elbows and found that tactile localization, measured with temporal order judgments, was unaffected by crossing the forearms. In Experiment 3, a crossed-limbs deficit was observed for touches on a single skin location when that location was distal- but not proximal-to the crossing point of the arms. In Experiment 4, we found a similar crossed-limbs deficit irrespective of how far distally to the crossing point touch was applied. Together, these results demonstrate that crossing the limbs affects tactile perception only distal to the point of crossing. The process of remapping tactile events does not take into account the end-point location of the limb, but an extremely precise metric description of the touch relative to the configuration of both arms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Crossed-hands deficit", "Remapping", "Spatial reference frame", "Tactile processing", "Temporal order judgment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Arm", "Body Image", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Proprioception", "Space Perception", "Touch Perception", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960927399", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"15135145500": {"Name": "Aza\u00f1\u00f3n E.", "AuthorID": "15135145500", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "57170822400": {"Name": "Radulova S.", "AuthorID": "57170822400", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "15765869300": {"Name": "Longo M.R.", "AuthorID": "15765869300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "7005933195": {"Name": "Haggard P.", "AuthorID": "7005933195", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
