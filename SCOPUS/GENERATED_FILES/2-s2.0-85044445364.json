The ocular surface is normally protected by the ability to produce tears, to blink and to close the eyes with rest or sleep. All of these mechanisms can be disrupted in the intensive care population, increasing the risk of developing ocular surface disease. Despite the scale of the problem, eye-care protocols are commonly not instigated and documentation of eye care is often poor. This review details the risk factors for developing ocular surface disease. It also provides evidence-based guidance on protecting the eyes in vulnerable patients, identifying diseases affecting the eye in intensive care patients and delivering the best treatment to the eye. There is growing evidence that adherence to a correctly performed eye-care guideline prevents the majority of corneal problems encountered in the intensive care unit.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eye care", "eye disease", "intensive care", "ocular surface disease", "ophthalmology"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044445364", "SubjectAreas": [["Critical Care Nursing", "NURS", "2906"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"57217944178": {"Name": "Hearne B.J.", "AuthorID": "57217944178", "AffiliationID": "60017238", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthetics Department, Royal United Hospital"}, "57201364184": {"Name": "Hearne E.G.", "AuthorID": "57201364184", "AffiliationID": "60017238", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Royal United Hospital"}, "35482685300": {"Name": "Montgomery H.", "AuthorID": "35482685300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "15035438500": {"Name": "Lightman S.L.", "AuthorID": "15035438500", "AffiliationID": "60016691, 60022148, 60013148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
