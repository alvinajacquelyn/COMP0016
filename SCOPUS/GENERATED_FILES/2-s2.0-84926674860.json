Recent studies have identified biomarkers of chronological age based on DNA methylation levels. It is not yet known whether DNA methylation age captures aspects of biological age. Results: Here we test whether differences between people's chronological ages and estimated ages, DNA methylation age, predict all-cause mortality in later life. The difference between DNA methylation age and chronological age ({increment}age) was calculated in four longitudinal cohorts of older people. Meta-analysis of proportional hazards models from the four cohorts was used to determine the association between {increment}age and mortality. A 5-year higher {increment}age is associated with a 21% higher mortality risk, adjusting for age and sex. After further adjustments for childhood IQ, education, social class, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and APOE e4 status, there is a 16% increased mortality risk for those with a 5-year higher {increment}age. A pedigree-based heritability analysis of {increment}age was conducted in a separate cohort. The heritability of {increment}age was 0.43. Conclusions: DNA methylation-derived measures of accelerated aging are heritable traits that predict mortality independently of health status, lifestyle factors, and known genetic factors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Blood", "Cause of Death", "Cohort Studies", "Demography", "DNA Methylation", "Female", "Humans", "Inheritance Patterns", "Leukocyte Count", "Male", "Mortality", "Risk Factors", "Survival Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926674860", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"24470564300": {"Name": "Marioni R.E.", "AuthorID": "24470564300", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland, Queensland Brain Institute"}, "7403484635": {"Name": "Harris S.E.", "AuthorID": "7403484635", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh, Medical Genetics Section, Centre for Genomic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"}, "55614945700": {"Name": "Cox S.R.", "AuthorID": "55614945700", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh, Department of Psychology"}, "7101906583": {"Name": "Starr J.M.", "AuthorID": "7101906583", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh, Alzheimer Scotland Dementia Research Centre"}, "7102668046": {"Name": "Visscher P.M.", "AuthorID": "7102668046", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60109259", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland, University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute"}, "57193752767": {"Name": "Deary I.J.", "AuthorID": "57193752767", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "University of Edinburgh, Department of Psychology"}, "55236808400": {"Name": "Shah S.", "AuthorID": "55236808400", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60109259", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland, University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute"}, "57186891400": {"Name": "McRae A.F.", "AuthorID": "57186891400", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60109259", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland, University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute"}, "7006428088": {"Name": "Wray N.R.", "AuthorID": "7006428088", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "The University of Queensland, Queensland Brain Institute"}, "56326143300": {"Name": "Chen B.H.", "AuthorID": "56326143300", "AffiliationID": "60005281", "AffiliationName": "Population Sciences Branch, Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}, "6504183575": {"Name": "Joehanes R.", "AuthorID": "6504183575", "AffiliationID": "60002746", "AffiliationName": "Hebrew Senior Life"}, "6701853655": {"Name": "Lunetta K.L.", "AuthorID": "6701853655", "AffiliationID": "60018701", "AffiliationName": "Boston University School of Public Health, Department of Biostatistics"}, "7003557869": {"Name": "Murabito J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003557869", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Boston University School of Medicine, Section of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine"}, "56841119800": {"Name": "Levy D.", "AuthorID": "56841119800", "AffiliationID": "60005281", "AffiliationName": "Population Sciences Branch, Division of Intramural Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"}, "54402559700": {"Name": "Colicino E.", "AuthorID": "54402559700", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Harvard T.H.
