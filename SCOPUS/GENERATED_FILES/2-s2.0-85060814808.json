DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3-4 years were recruited from 30 childcare centres in Cambridgeshire (UK) in 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Objectively measured height and weight was used to calculate z-BMI; waist circumference and height were used to generate WHR; subscapular and tricep skinfolds were used to calculate SST. Associations between childcare attendance, the nutrition, physical activity, and overall childcare environment, and three anthropometric outcomes were explored using two-level hierarchical regression models, adjusting for demographic and family based confounders. RESULTS: Valid data were available for 196 children (49% female). Time spent in care, the nutrition, physical activity and overall childcare environment were not associated with children's z-BMI, WHR and SST. CONCLUSIONS: Childcare environment and level of attendance were not associated with UK preschool-aged children's anthropometry. The childcare environment has been central to intervention efforts to prevent/reduce early childhood obesity, yet other factors, including child-level, family level, wider environmental and policy-level factors warrant substantial attention when considering obesity prevention strategies for young children.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anthropometry", "childcare environment", "nutrition", "physical activity", "preschool"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anthropometry", "Child Care", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Energy Metabolism", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Male", "Pediatric Obesity", "Social Environment", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060814808", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"55868344300": {"Name": "Hesketh K.R.", "AuthorID": "55868344300", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Behavior and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "16243910000": {"Name": "Benjamin-Neelon S.E.", "AuthorID": "16243910000", "AffiliationID": "60006183", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Behavior and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health"}, "8570650800": {"Name": "van Sluijs E.M.F.", "AuthorID": "8570650800", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60009969", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Diet and Activity Research and MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge"}}}
