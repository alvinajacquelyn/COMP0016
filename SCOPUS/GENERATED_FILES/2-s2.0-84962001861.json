It would be advantageous to be able to broaden the bandwidth, as this could lead to a more spatially-concentrated focal region. One way of increasing the bandwidth is to generate harmonics. The eventual aim of this study is to generate wideband ultrasonic signals with high amplitudes, primarily for therapeutic ultrasound and drug delivery applications. In this paper, a new ultrasonic transducer technology using a one-dimensional chain of spheres is presented to achieve this aim.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Drug delivery applications", "High intensity focused ultrasound", "High intensity ultrasounds", "Narrowband signal", "Nonlinear generation", "One-dimensional chains", "Therapeutic ultrasound", "Ultrasonic signals"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962001861", "SubjectAreas": [["Acoustics and Ultrasonics", "PHYS", "3102"]], "AuthorData": {"25627901700": {"Name": "Harput S.", "AuthorID": "25627901700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasonics and Instrumentation Group, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "15136075700": {"Name": "McLaughlan J.", "AuthorID": "15136075700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasonics and Instrumentation Group, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "23102587700": {"Name": "Freear S.", "AuthorID": "23102587700", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "Ultrasonics and Instrumentation Group, School of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Leeds"}, "6505814954": {"Name": "Gelat P.", "AuthorID": "6505814954", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "6603625764": {"Name": "Saffari N.", "AuthorID": "6603625764", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "56982480200": {"Name": "Yang J.", "AuthorID": "56982480200", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "56043323600": {"Name": "Akanji O.", "AuthorID": "56043323600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "56413563600": {"Name": "Thomas P.", "AuthorID": "56413563600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}, "7102874618": {"Name": "Hutchins D.", "AuthorID": "7102874618", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering, University of Warwick"}}}
