All rights reserved.The demonstration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in ancient skeletons gives researchers an insight into its evolution. Findings of the last two decades sketched the biological relationships between the various species of tubercle bacilli, the time scale involved, their possible origin and dispersal. This paper includes the available evidence and on-going research. In the submerged Eastern Mediterranean Neolithic village of Atlit Yam (9000 BP), a human lineage of M. tuberculosis, defined by the TbD1 deletion in its genome, was demonstrated. An infected infant at the site provides an example of active tuberculosis in a human with a na\u00efve immune system. Over 4000 years later tuberculosis was found in Jericho. Urbanization increases population density encouraging M. tuberculosis/human co-evolution. As susceptible humans die of tuberculosis, survivors develop genetic resistance to disease. Thus in 18th century Hungarian mummies from V\u00e1c, 65% were positive for tuberculosis yet a 95-year-old woman had clearly survived a childhood Ghon lesion. Whole genome studies are in progress, to detect changes over the millennia both in bacterial virulence and also host susceptibility/resistance genes that determine the NRAMP protein and Killer Cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (KIRs). This paper surveys present evidence and includes initial findings.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ancient DNA", "Evolution", "KIR historical specimens", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "SLC11A1 gene", "Solute Carrier family genes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cation Transport Proteins", "Cattle", "Disease Resistance", "Evolution, Molecular", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome, Bacterial", "Genome, Human", "Genotype", "History, 18th Century", "History, 19th Century", "History, Ancient", "Host-Pathogen Interactions", "Humans", "Mummies", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Paleopathology", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931560833", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55242127500": {"Name": "Spigelman M.", "AuthorID": "55242127500", "AffiliationID": "60072445, 60007903", "AffiliationName": "Kuvin Center for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases and Ancient DNA, Hadassah Medical School, Hebrew University"}, "6701847443": {"Name": "Donoghue H.", "AuthorID": "6701847443", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the History of Medicine, Division of Biosciences, University College London"}, "7004032045": {"Name": "Hershkovitz I.", "AuthorID": "7004032045", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anatomy and Anthropology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University"}, "7005561147": {"Name": "Greenblatt C.", "AuthorID": "7005561147", "AffiliationID": "60072445, 60007903", "AffiliationName": "Kuvin Center for the Study of Infectious and Tropical Diseases and Ancient DNA, Hadassah Medical School, Hebrew University"}, "6603408815": {"Name": "Abdeen Z.", "AuthorID": "6603408815", "AffiliationID": "60031805", "AffiliationName": "Al-Quds Nutrition and Health Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Al-Quds University"}, "12801202000": {"Name": "Ereqat S.", "AuthorID": "12801202000", "AffiliationID": "60031805", "AffiliationName": "Al-Quds Nutrition and Health Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Al-Quds University"}, "55303718300": {"Name": "Sarie I.", "AuthorID": "55303718300", "AffiliationID": "60031805", "AffiliationName": "Al-Quds Nutrition and Health Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Al-Quds University"}, "7004366473": {"Name": "Pap I.", "AuthorID": "7004366473", "AffiliationID": "60010644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum"}, "6506973016": {"Name": "Szikossy I.", "AuthorID": "6506973016", "AffiliationID": "60010644", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum"}, "6507476497": {"Name": "Bar-Gal G.", "AuthorID": "6507476497", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Koret School of Veterinary Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}, "7003292392": {"Name": "Matheson C.", "AuthorID": "7003292392", "AffiliationID": "60025949", "AffiliationName": "Paleo-DNA Laboratory, Department of Anthropology and Biology, Lakehead University"}}}
