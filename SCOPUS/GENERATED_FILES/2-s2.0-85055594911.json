Changes in organization of the myocardium in CHD, and in its mechanical properties, conduction, and blood supply, result in altered myocardial function both before and after surgery. To gain a better understanding and develop appropriate and individualized treatment strategies, the microscopic organization of cardiomyocytes, and their integration at a macroscopic level, needs to be completely understood. The aim of this study is to describe, for the first time, in 3 dimensions and nondestructively the detailed remodeling of cardiac microstructure present in a human fetal heart with complex CHD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast imaging was used to image an archival midgestation formalin-fixed fetal heart with right isomerism and complex CHD and compare with a control fetal heart. Analysis of myocyte aggregates, at detail not accessible with other techniques, was performed. Macroanatomic and conduction system changes specific to the disease were clearly observable, together with disordered myocyte organization in the morphologically right ventricle myocardium. Electrical activation simulations suggested altered synchronicity of the morphologically right ventricle. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown the potential of X-ray phase-contrast imaging for studying cardiac microstructure in the developing human fetal heart at high resolution providing novel insight while preserving valuable archival material for future study. This is the first study to show myocardial alterations occur in complex CHD as early as midgestation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["fetal heart", "humans", "isomerism", "myocardium", "synchrotrons", "X-ray microtomography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Fetal Heart", "Heart Defects, Congenital", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine", "Myocytes, Cardiac", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Trimester, Second", "Prenatal Diagnosis", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055594911", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"54388912000": {"Name": "Garcia-Canadilla P.", "AuthorID": "54388912000", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communications Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, C.B."}, "37078948800": {"Name": "Cook A.C.", "AuthorID": "37078948800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science (P.G.-C., University College London"}, "55853348100": {"Name": "Zhang C.", "AuthorID": "55853348100", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communications Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, C.B."}, "6603296130": {"Name": "Butakoff C.", "AuthorID": "6603296130", "AffiliationID": "60032942", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information and Communications Technologies, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, C.B."}, "7005275311": {"Name": "Bijnens B.", "AuthorID": "7005275311", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Instituci\u00f3n Catalana de Investigaci\u00f3n y Estudios Avanzados"}, "57188694519": {"Name": "Dejea H.", "AuthorID": "57188694519", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "52463234100": {"Name": "Bonnin A.", "AuthorID": "52463234100", "AffiliationID": "123129209", "AffiliationName": "Swiss Light Source"}, "54909987700": {"Name": "Stampanoni M.", "AuthorID": "54909987700", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical Engineering, ETH Zurich"}, "55652389200": {"Name": "Balicevic V.", "AuthorID": "55652389200", "AffiliationID": "60159855, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb"}, "35547763500": {"Name": "Loncaric S.", "AuthorID": "35547763500", "AffiliationID": "60159855, 60008408", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb"}, "13605899600": {"Name": "Aguado-Sierra J.", "AuthorID": "13605899600", "AffiliationID": "60097745", "AffiliationName": "Barcelona Supercomputing Center-Centro Nacional de Supercomputaci\u00f3n"}, "7401539932": {"Name": "V\u00e1zquez M.", "AuthorID": "7401539932", "AffiliationID": "60019058", "AffiliationName": "IIIA-CSIC"}, "56609734100": {"Name": "Jackson L.H.", "AuthorID": "56609734100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (L.H.J., University College London"}, "14820025000": {"Name": "Stuckey D.J.", "AuthorID": "14820025000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Advanced Biomedical Imaging (L.H.J., University College London"}, "57205077339": {"Name": "Rau C.", "AuthorID": "57205077339", "AffiliationID": "121506511", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Manchester Imaging Branchline (I13-2), United Kingdom (C.R.)"}}}
