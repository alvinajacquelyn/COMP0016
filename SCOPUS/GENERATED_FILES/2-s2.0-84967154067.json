This may partly be due to an increased salience of peers during adolescence. We investigated the effect of being observed by a peer on a cognitively challenging task, relational reasoning, which requires the evaluation and integration of multiple mental representations. Relational reasoning tasks engage a fronto-parietal network including the inferior parietal cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, dorsolateral and rostrolateral prefrontal cortices. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), peer audience effects on activation in this fronto-parietal network were compared in a group of 19 female mid-adolescents (aged 14-16 years) and 14 female adults (aged 23-28 years). Adolescent and adult relational reasoning accuracy was influenced by a peer audience as a function of task difficulty: the presence of a peer audience led to decreased accuracy in the complex, relational integration condition in both groups of participants. The fMRI results demonstrated that a peer audience differentially modulated activation in regions of the fronto-parietal network in adolescents and adults. Activation was increased in adolescents in the presence of a peer audience, while this was not the case in adults.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Audience effect", "FMRI", "Peer influence", "Reasoning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Oxygen", "Peer Group", "Psychology, Adolescent", "Reaction Time", "Social Behavior", "Thinking", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84967154067", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"12787193300": {"Name": "Dumontheil I.", "AuthorID": "12787193300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Sciences, Birkbeck, University of London"}, "55803312300": {"Name": "Wolf L.K.", "AuthorID": "55803312300", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}, "26643513600": {"Name": "Blakemore S.J.", "AuthorID": "26643513600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}}}
