To this end, probe molecules are utilized to obtain a ranking of acid strengths. Trimethylphosphine oxide (TMPO) is a widely used probe molecule, which allows the sensing of solid acids by using 31P NMR. We have performed calculations based on the density functional theory to investigate the Br\u00f8nsted acid (BA) sites in zeolite MFI by adsorbing TMPO as a probe molecule. We have considered the substitution of silicon at the T2 site by aluminum, both at the internal cavity and at the external surface. The different acid strengths observed in the zeolite MFI when probed by TMPO (very strong, strong, and weak) may depend on the basicity of the centers sharing the acid proton. If the proton lies between the TMPO and one of the framework oxygen atoms binding the Al, the acidity is strong. When the framework oxygen atom is not directly binding the Al, it is less basic and a shortening of the TMPO-H distance is observed, causing an acid response of very strong. Finally, if two TMPO molecules share the proton, the TMPO-H distance elongates, rendering a weak acid character.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acid strengths", "DFT modeling", "External surfaces", "Internal cavities", "Oxygen atom", "Probe molecules", "Trimethylphosphines", "Zeolite mfi"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984904169", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"]], "AuthorData": {"56313919100": {"Name": "Hernandez-Tamargo C.", "AuthorID": "56313919100", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "54790560500": {"Name": "De Leeuw N.", "AuthorID": "54790560500", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}, "23569649000": {"Name": "Roldan A.", "AuthorID": "23569649000", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, Cardiff University, Main Building"}}}
