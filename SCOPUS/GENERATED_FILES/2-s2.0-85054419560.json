Established methods for optical or nuclear imaging have several advantages, but lack the high 3D spatial resolution necessary to identify complex internal tissue structure which is offered by MRI. This chapter will introduce the concept of gene reporters (genetically-encoded proteins that produce a signal), their potential applications, and the developments made in this field using Magnetic Resonance-based techniques.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Molecular imaging", "MRI", "MRI reporter genes", "NMR", "Reporter genes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biological dynamics", "Encoded proteins", "Internal tissues", "MRI reporter genes", "Nuclear imaging", "Reporter gene", "Spatial resolution"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054419560", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"55811675700": {"Name": "Patrick P.", "AuthorID": "55811675700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre of Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "9434519300": {"Name": "Kalber T.", "AuthorID": "9434519300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre of Advanced Biomedical Imaging, Division of Medicine, University College London"}}}
