Determination of optimum and repeatable acquisition procedures is well documented in the literature but so far this has not focused on evaluating the levelling procedure used to align the camera. In this paper, the standard recommendation that tripod levelling is a necessity is tested by comparing it with a hand-levelled procedure. The results show that the average difference between the two procedures is < 2% for effective plant area index and < 1% for gap fraction at the VALERI plot scale, which generally falls within the variance. Users implementing the hand-levelled technique can expect large reductions in data acquisition time, allowing many more samples to be collected without compromising the overall quality of the data retrieved.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hemispherical photography", "Levelling", "Plant area index", "Sensor comparison"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85012892370", "SubjectAreas": [["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Agronomy and Crop Science", "AGRI", "1102"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"57192694485": {"Name": "Origo N.", "AuthorID": "57192694485", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "55574436900": {"Name": "Calders K.", "AuthorID": "55574436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "14033392700": {"Name": "Nightingale J.", "AuthorID": "14033392700", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Earth Observation, Climate and Optical group, National Physical Laboratory"}, "7006197933": {"Name": "Disney M.", "AuthorID": "7006197933", "AffiliationID": "60007317", "AffiliationName": "NERC National Centre for Earth Observation"}}}
