Their extensive fossil record is a testament to their important biogeochemical role and is a valuable archive of biotic responses to environmental change stretching back over 200 million years. However, to realise the full potential of this archive for (palaeo-)biology and biogeochemistry requires an understanding of the physiological processes that underpin coccosphere architecture. Using culturing experiments on four modern coccolithophore species (Calcidiscus leptoporus, Calcidiscus quadriperforatus, Helicosphaera carteri and Coccolithus braarudii) from three long-lived families, we investigate how coccosphere architecture responds to shifts from exponential (rapid cell division) to stationary (slowed cell division) growth phases as cell physiology reacts to nutrient depletion. These experiments reveal statistical differences in coccosphere size and the number of coccoliths per cell between these two growth phases, specifically that cells in exponential-phase growth are typically smaller with fewer coccoliths, whereas cells experiencing growth-limiting nutrient depletion have larger coccosphere sizes and greater numbers of coccoliths per cell. Although the exact numbers are species-specific, these growth-phase shifts in coccosphere geometry demonstrate that the core physiological responses of cells to nutrient depletion result in increased coccosphere sizes and coccoliths per cell across four different coccolithophore families (Calcidiscaceae, Coccolithaceae, Isochrysidaceae and Helicosphaeraceae), a representative diversity of this phytoplankton group. Building on this, the direct comparison of coccosphere geometries in modern and fossil coccolithophores enables a proxy for growth phase to be developed that can be used to investigate growth responses to environmental change throughout their long evolutionary history. Our data also show that changes in growth rate and coccoliths per cell associated with growth-phase shifts can substantially alter cellular calcite production. Coccosphere geometry is therefore a valuable tool for accessing growth information in the fossil record, providing unprecedented insights into the response of species to environmental change and the potential biogeochemical consequences.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016266403", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"56442691300": {"Name": "Sheward R.", "AuthorID": "56442691300", "AffiliationID": "60007762", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geosciences, Goethe University Frankfurt"}, "7103263763": {"Name": "Gibbs S.", "AuthorID": "7103263763", "AffiliationID": "60025225, 60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean and Earth Science, University of Southampton, National Oceanography Centre"}, "6701523871": {"Name": "Poulton A.", "AuthorID": "6701523871", "AffiliationID": "60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems, National Oceanography Centre"}, "55242053000": {"Name": "Daniels C.", "AuthorID": "55242053000", "AffiliationID": "60010934", "AffiliationName": "Ocean Biogeochemistry and Ecosystems, National Oceanography Centre"}, "6701346236": {"Name": "Bown P.", "AuthorID": "6701346236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
