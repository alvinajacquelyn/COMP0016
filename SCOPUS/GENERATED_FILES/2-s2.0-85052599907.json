In search of new antiinflammatories, efforts have focused on harnessing endogenous pathways that drive resolution of inflammation for therapeutic gain. Identification of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, maresins) as effector molecules of resolution has shown promise in this regard. However, their action on inflammatory resolution in humans is unknown. Here, we demonstrate using a model of UV-killed Escherichia coli-triggered skin inflammation that SPMs are biosynthesized at the local site at the start of resolution, coinciding with the expression of receptors that transduce their actions. These include receptors for lipoxin A4 (ALX/FPR2), resolvin E1 (ChemR23), resolvin D2 (GPR18), and resolvin D1 (GPR32) that were differentially expressed on the endothelium and infiltrating leukocytes. Administering SPMs into the inflamed site 4 hours after bacterial injection caused a reduction in PMN numbers over the ensuing 6 hours, the phase of active resolution in this model. These results indicate that in humans, the appearance of SPMs and their receptors is associated with the beginning of inflammatory resolution and that their therapeutic supplementation enhanced the resolution response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eicosanoids", "Inflammation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052599907", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"56094605200": {"Name": "Motwani M.", "AuthorID": "56094605200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35361960100": {"Name": "George M.", "AuthorID": "35361960100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57191980851": {"Name": "Flint J.", "AuthorID": "57191980851", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "56659516600": {"Name": "De Maeyer R.", "AuthorID": "56659516600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7006273046": {"Name": "Gilroy D.", "AuthorID": "7006273046", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "35975590200": {"Name": "Colas R.", "AuthorID": "35975590200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Lipid Mediator Unit, Biochemical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, Bart's and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "16416651300": {"Name": "Dalli J.", "AuthorID": "16416651300", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Lipid Mediator Unit, Biochemical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, Bart's and the London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "55867579900": {"Name": "Richard-Loendt A.", "AuthorID": "55867579900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, University College London Institute of Neurology"}, "7101709764": {"Name": "Serhan C.", "AuthorID": "7101709764", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Center for Experimental Therapeutics and Reperfusion Injury, Department of Anesthesiology, Pain Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School"}}}
