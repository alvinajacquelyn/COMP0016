These boundary conditions are well known to provide accurate models for thin layers or imperfectly conducting bodies. We give two different formulations of the scattering problem and we provide some general assumptions on the boundary condition under which the scattering problem has at most one solution. We also prove that it is well-posed for three different boundary conditions which involve second order surface differential operators under weak sign assumptions on the coefficients defining the surface operators.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Electromagnetic scattering", "Generalized impedance boundary conditions", "Helmholtz' decomposition", "Maxwell's equations"], "IndexKeywords": ["Conducting bodies", "Different boundary condition", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Electromagnetic scattering problem", "Generalized impedance boundary conditions", "Helmholtz", "Scattering problems", "Surface differentials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971667670", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"], ["Numerical Analysis", "MATH", "2612"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"49360963100": {"Name": "Chaulet N.", "AuthorID": "49360963100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
