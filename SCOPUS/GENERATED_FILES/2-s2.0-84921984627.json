Their chloride binding affinities as well as their transport properties in POPC bilayers were examined. These receptors were found to function as anion carriers, which can mediate both Cl-/NO3- antiport and H+/Cl- symport, and the transport activity of these hosts were dominated by their lipophilicity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anion binding", "Anion carriers", "Anion receptor", "Antiports", "Chloride binding", "Click reaction", "Lipophilicity", "Transport activity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921984627", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57217167299": {"Name": "Merckx T.", "AuthorID": "57217167299", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven"}, "26535124200": {"Name": "Verwilst P.", "AuthorID": "26535124200", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven"}, "7005455325": {"Name": "Dehaen W.", "AuthorID": "7005455325", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Design and Synthesis, Department of Chemistry, KU Leuven"}, "35974995200": {"Name": "Haynes C.J.E.", "AuthorID": "35974995200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "37016371200": {"Name": "Karagiannidis L.E.", "AuthorID": "37016371200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "56498563800": {"Name": "Clarke H.J.", "AuthorID": "56498563800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "56379901700": {"Name": "Holder K.", "AuthorID": "56379901700", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "56498450200": {"Name": "Kelly A.", "AuthorID": "56498450200", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "6505775443": {"Name": "Tizzard G.J.", "AuthorID": "6505775443", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "7103304547": {"Name": "Coles S.J.", "AuthorID": "7103304547", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, University of Southampton"}, "7101973605": {"Name": "Gale P.A.", "AuthorID": "7101973605", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry, University of Southampton"}}}
