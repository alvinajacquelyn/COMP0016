To date, these social modulation effects have been explained by the primed incentive to affiliate with another (Social Top-Down Response Modulation; STORM) and the primed active-self-concept leading to behaviour that is either consistent or inconsistent with the primed-construct (Active-Self account). This study was designed to explore the explanatory power of each of these accounts and thereby gain a greater understanding of how social modulation unfolds. To do this, we assessed social modulation of motor contagion in individuals high or low in self-monitoring. It was reasoned that high self-monitors would modulate mimicry according to the primed social incentive, whereas low self-monitors would modulate according to the primed active-self-concept. Participants were primed with a pro-social and anti-social cue in the first-person and third-person perspective. Next, they completed an interpersonal observation-execution task featuring the simultaneous observation and execution of arm movements that were either congruent or incongruent to each other. Results showed increased incongruent movement deviation (motor contagion) for the anti-social compared to the pro-social prime in the high self-monitors only. Findings support the STORM account of mimicry by showing observers modulate behaviour based on the social incentive underpinning an interpersonal exchange.", "AuthorKeywords": ["active-self", "Motor contagion", "self-monitoring", "social modulation", "top-down"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Analysis of Variance", "Attitude", "Female", "Humans", "Imitative Behavior", "Male", "Movement", "Psychomotor Performance", "Self Concept", "Social Behavior", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052826938", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"55483031200": {"Name": "Roberts J.", "AuthorID": "55483031200", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "7403105607": {"Name": "Bennett S.", "AuthorID": "7403105607", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}, "8629701800": {"Name": "Hayes S.", "AuthorID": "8629701800", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Brain and Behaviour Laboratory, Faculty of Science, Liverpool John Moores University"}}}
