Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.Background: Dementia of Alzheimer's type (AD) is related to decreased survival. It is not clear whether also biological markers of AD are related to mortality. Low levels of amyloid beta-42 (A\u03b242) and high levels of total tau (T-tau) protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are established biomarkers for AD. Objective: Our aim was to investigate whether levels of A\u03b242 and T-tau are associated with survival among octogenarians independently of dementia status. Methods: Sixty-five 85-year-olds underwent lumbar puncture and were followed with repeated neuropsychiatric examinations until death. Results: Lower CSF A\u03b242 (p = 0.010) and higher CSF T-tau (p = 0.005) at the age of 85 were associated with lower survival independently of dementia status at baseline and follow-up. Low CSF A\u03b242 and high CSF T-tau were also related to baseline dementia at the age of 85 years, and lower CSF A\u03b242 with increased dementia incidence during the first 3 years of follow-up. Conclusions: Biological markers of AD are associated with mortality in octogenarians. The reason for this needs further study. Our findings highlight the importance to consider the competing risk of death when evaluating biological markers of AD in the very old.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Epidemiology", "Survival", "Tau protein"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Female", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Peptide Fragments", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Sweden", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064195518", "SubjectAreas": [["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57193849344": {"Name": "Ribbe M.", "AuthorID": "57193849344", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry Epidemiology, Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "55496142200": {"Name": "Kern S.", "AuthorID": "55496142200", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57199092291": {"Name": "B\u00f6rjesson Hansson A.", "AuthorID": "57199092291", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry Epidemiology, Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "6602243803": {"Name": "\u00d6stling S.", "AuthorID": "6602243803", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry Epidemiology, Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute, UCL"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "7005834411": {"Name": "Skoog I.", "AuthorID": "7005834411", "AffiliationID": "107130241", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry Epidemiology, Neuropsychiatric Epidemiology Unit"}}}
