Healthcare professionals have a supporting role to reduce the burden on parents who feel responsible for conveying information to their child and other family members. Objective: To examine parents\u2019 and healthcare professionals\u2019 perceptions of roles in receiving and communicating information when a child is diagnosed with and treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Design, setting and participants: We used the principles of a grounded theory approach. This was a single site study, recruiting from a principal children's cancer treatment centre in the United Kingdom. The sample included parents of children receiving and completed treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 28), and healthcare professionals (n = 34). Methods: Methods included individual interviews, face-to-face and telephone, focus groups, and an online forum. Findings: Communication \u2018touch points\u2019 are many over the course of a child's cancer journey. We describe often \u2018mismatched\u2019 communication encounters where those seeking information and those providing information have different goals. Healthcare professionals in the encounter have expertise at the outset while parents have less expertise, but this expertise grows over time and this can increase the perceptions of this \u2018mismatch\u2019 and create different challenges. Conclusions: Considered in the context of middle range transition theory, we might suggest that parental foreground (seeking information directly) and background (passive actors) roles are the result of differing levels of uncertainty, and depend on the situation and preferences and child and family needs that may present differently over time in different contexts. Our work contributes to the emerging consensus that communication is more than a core set of skills that healthcare professionals just need to learn: clear specifications of mutual roles, responsibilities and a shared understanding of goals is also essential.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Children and parents", "Communication intervention", "Communication patterns"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Female", "Health Personnel", "Humans", "Male", "Parents", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Professional-Family Relations", "Qualitative Research", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046162561", "SubjectAreas": [["Nursing (all)", "NURS", "2900"]], "AuthorData": {"7101616129": {"Name": "Gibson F.", "AuthorID": "7101616129", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60018207", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes and Experience Research in Children's Health, Illness and Disability (ORCHID), Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and School of Health Science, University of Surrey"}, "35848720200": {"Name": "Kumpunen S.", "AuthorID": "35848720200", "AffiliationID": "105715038", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Trust"}, "36160937100": {"Name": "Bryan G.", "AuthorID": "36160937100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Louis Dundas Centre for Children's Palliative Care, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56012566500": {"Name": "Forbat L.", "AuthorID": "56012566500", "AffiliationID": "60010679", "AffiliationName": "Calvary Health Care Bruce and the Australian Catholic University"}}}
