In children's services, despite many partners, there are challenges around integrating care. A deprived borough of London ran short training and networking sessions for services supporting children and young people. This study examined whether intersectoral training would improve participants' knowledge of local services and joint working (including communication, navigation and confidence in collaboration). As part of a service evaluation, the study utilised a pre\u2013post Likert scale survey design for each training session, a 1-month follow-up survey, and telephone interviews with a subsample of participants. The educational intervention was three sets of 1.5 hr educational workshops from December 2016 to February 2017. There were 302 attendances from 202 individuals from the health (n = 99), education (n = 145), social care (n = 39) and voluntary (n = 19) sectors. The pre and post surveys found significant increases in self-assessed knowledge of health/education/social care/voluntary services and in some elements of joint working. However, these increases were not sustained in any domain after 1 month of follow-up. There was also no difference in self-assessments amongst those who attended three sessions compared to those who attended one or two. Telephone interviewees highlighted networking as being helpful and suggested that informative tasks and diverse attendance would be beneficial in future. To conclude, this study suggests that although short-learning sessions may seem to improve immediate knowledge and some elements of joint working in the short term, any gains are not sustained in the long term. The cost effectiveness of such schemes is in doubt but may be improved by a more targeted delivery of content.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "community", "education", "networking", "young people"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child Health", "Child Health Services", "Female", "Health Education", "Humans", "London", "Male", "Social Work"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054319001", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57200553338": {"Name": "Alexander E.C.", "AuthorID": "57200553338", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "King's College London GKT School of Medical Education"}, "55877808200": {"Name": "de Silva D.", "AuthorID": "55877808200", "AffiliationID": "113921446", "AffiliationName": "The Evidence Centre"}, "57202456916": {"Name": "Clarke R.", "AuthorID": "57202456916", "AffiliationID": "116356013", "AffiliationName": "London Borough of Newham"}, "6508017249": {"Name": "Peachey M.", "AuthorID": "6508017249", "AffiliationID": "116356013", "AffiliationName": "London Borough of Newham"}, "36499843200": {"Name": "Manikam L.", "AuthorID": "36499843200", "AffiliationID": "121416148", "AffiliationName": "Aceso Global Health Consultants Ltd"}}}
