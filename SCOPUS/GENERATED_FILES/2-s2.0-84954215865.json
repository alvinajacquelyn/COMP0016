It highlights an emerging interest in personal digital archiving and sees this as a fruitful area for more transformative forms of cross disciplinary working. A study is described in which an attempt is made to expose and actively engage UK based archivists and records managers with a selection of literature and research about personal digital archiving taken from the ACM Digital Library. The aim of the study was to see what, if anything, could be learnt through this process and whether, and in what way, such interaction might engender new insight and innovation. Although little new insight and innovation were so engendered, the study still makes a contribution as a provocation to reflect on cross disciplinary working and its importance for shaping new fields of study such as personal digital archiving.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archives and records management", "Cross disciplinary working", "Personal digital archiving"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cross-disciplinary", "Digital Archiving"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954215865", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55605817600": {"Name": "Bunn J.", "AuthorID": "55605817600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
