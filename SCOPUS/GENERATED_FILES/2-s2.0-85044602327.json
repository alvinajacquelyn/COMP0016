However, its limited utilization of visible light and high recombination ratio of photoinduced electron\u2013hole pairs suppress its photocatalytic activity. The key issue in improving photocatalytic efficiency lies in fabricating a p\u2013n heterojunction with efficient interfacial contact and broadband absorption. Here, we developed a method for fabricating an interlaced Ni3S2/MoS2 heterostructure with close interfacial contact. In our fabrication approach, a porous Ni3S2 scaffold is prepared by chemical vapor deposition and a hydrothermal method is used to prepare a Ni3S2/MoS2 photocatalyst with close interfacial contact. The numerous interfaces of the interlaced Ni3S2/MoS2 heterostructures promote effective electron\u2013hole pair separation and facilitate electron transfer. Meanwhile, the hybrid Ni3S2/MoS2 nanostructures favor broadband absorption extending from 300 to 800 nm. As a result, the hybrid Ni3S2/MoS2 exhibits a remarkable rate of hydrogen evolution (540.75 \u03bcmol g\u22121 h\u22121), which is 5.71 and 3.89 times greater than those of pure Ni3S2 and MoS2, respectively, under otherwise identical conditions. The results of this work are significant for developing promising transition-metal sulfide heterostructures in the field of hydrogen evolution by photocatalytic water splitting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Heterostructure", "Interfacial contact", "MoS2", "Ni3S2", "Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution"], "IndexKeywords": ["Environmental pollutions", "Interfacial contact", "MoS2", "Ni3S2", "Photocatalytic efficiency", "Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution", "Photocatalytic water splitting", "Transition metal sulfides"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044602327", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57004081500": {"Name": "Guo S.", "AuthorID": "57004081500", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "57193426594": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57193426594", "AffiliationID": "60003977", "AffiliationName": "Research & Development Institute of Northwestern Polytechnical University in Shenzhen"}, "57203829779": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57203829779", "AffiliationID": "60003977", "AffiliationName": "Research & Development Institute of Northwestern Polytechnical University in Shenzhen"}, "56534342000": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "56534342000", "AffiliationID": "60022414", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Silicate Materials for Architectures, Wuhan University of Technology"}, "12243904200": {"Name": "Huang Z.", "AuthorID": "12243904200", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University"}, "56412328200": {"Name": "Ren X.", "AuthorID": "56412328200", "AffiliationID": "60001455, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Intelligent Computing & Signal Processing, Ministry of Education, Anhui University"}, "56419475000": {"Name": "Sha W.E.I.", "AuthorID": "56419475000", "AffiliationID": "60117753, 60003970", "AffiliationName": "College of Information Science & Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University"}}}
