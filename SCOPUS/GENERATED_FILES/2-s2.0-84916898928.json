Relative to England and Wales, the excess is only partially explained by area deprivation. We tested the extent to which sociodemographic, behavioural, anthropometric and biological factors explain the higher mortality in Scotland compared with England. Methods: Pooled data from 18 nationally representative cohort studies comprising the Health Surveys for England (HSE) and the Scottish Health Survey (SHS). Cox regression analysis was used to quantify the excess mortality risk in Scotland relative to England with adjustment for baseline characteristics. Results: A total of 193 873 participants with a mean of 9.6 years follow-up gave rise to 21 345 deaths. The age-adjusted and sex-adjusted all-cause mortality HR for Scottish respondents compared with English respondents was 1.40 (95% CI 1.34 to 1.47), which attenuated to 1.29 (95% CI 1.23 to 1.36) with the addition of the baseline socioeconomic and behavioural characteristics. Cause-specific mortality HRs attenuated only marginally to 1.43 (95% 1.28 to 1.60) for ischaemic heart disease, 1.37 (95% CI 1.15 to 1.63) for stroke, 1.41 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.53) for all cancers, 3.43 (95% CI 1.85 to 6.36) for illicit drug-related poisoning and 4.64 (95% CI 3.55 to 6.05) for alcohol-related mortality. The excess was greatest among young adults (16-44 years) and was observed across all occupational social classes with the greatest excess in the unskilled group. Conclusions: Only a quarter of the excess mortality among Scottish respondents could be explained by the available baseline risk factors. Greater understanding is required on the lived experience of poverty, the role of social support, and the historical, environmental, cultural and political influences on health in Scotland.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Cohort Studies", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "England", "Female", "Health Behavior", "Health Surveys", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Scotland", "Sex Distribution", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Substance-Related Disorders", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84916898928", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"24332520600": {"Name": "McCartney G.", "AuthorID": "24332520600", "AffiliationID": "60162135", "AffiliationName": "NHS Health Scotland"}, "36667256000": {"Name": "Russ T.C.", "AuthorID": "36667256000", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cognitive Ageing and Cognitive Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh"}, "7003988354": {"Name": "Batty G.D.", "AuthorID": "7003988354", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "35410769700": {"Name": "Walsh D.", "AuthorID": "35410769700", "AffiliationID": "108116020", "AffiliationName": "Glasgow Centre for Population Health"}, "6603810294": {"Name": "Lewsey J.", "AuthorID": "6603810294", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow"}, "57189618283": {"Name": "Smith M.", "AuthorID": "57189618283", "AffiliationID": "60032803", "AffiliationName": "NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde"}, "35354080500": {"Name": "Smith G.D.", "AuthorID": "35354080500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Causal Analyses in Translational Epidemiology, School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol"}, "55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney"}}}
