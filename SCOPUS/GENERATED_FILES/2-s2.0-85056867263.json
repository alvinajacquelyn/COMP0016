However this is still an open research problem, and previous research in predicting malicious events only looked at binary outcomes (e.g., whether an attack would happen or not), but not at the specific steps that an attacker would undertake. To fill this gap we present Tiresias, a system that leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict future events on a machine, based on previous observations. We test Tiresias on a dataset of 3.4 billion security events collected from a commercial intrusion prevention system, and show that our approach is effective in predicting the next event that will occur on a machine with a precision of up to 0.93. We also show that the models learned by Tiresias are reasonably stable over time, and provide a mechanism that can identify sudden drops in precision and trigger a retraining of the system. Finally, we show that the long-term memory typical of RNNs is key in performing event prediction, rendering simpler methods not up to the task.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Prediction", "Recurrent Neural Network", "System Security"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computer attacks", "Event prediction", "Intrusion prevention systems", "Long term memory", "Malicious activities", "Recurrent neural network (RNNs)", "Research problems", "System security"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056867263", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"56228379900": {"Name": "Shen Y.", "AuthorID": "56228379900", "AffiliationID": "60079765", "AffiliationName": "Symantec Research Labs"}, "55481165400": {"Name": "Vervier P.A.", "AuthorID": "55481165400", "AffiliationID": "60079765", "AffiliationName": "Symantec Research Labs"}, "57189589235": {"Name": "Mariconti E.", "AuthorID": "57189589235", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "36810977700": {"Name": "Stringhini G.", "AuthorID": "36810977700", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Boston University"}}}
