Design: UK-based observational cohort study. Methods: HIV-positive participants with more than one visit after 1 January 2000 were identified. Each person-month was classified as being in or out-of-care based on the dates of the expected and observed next care visits. Cox models investigated associations between mortality and the cumulative proportion of months spent in-care (% IC, lagged by 1 year), and cumulative %IC prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in those attending clinic for more than 1 year, with adjustment for age, CD4+/viral load, year, sex, infection mode, ethnicity, and receipt/type of ART. Results: The 44 432 individuals (27.8% women; 50.5% homosexual, 28.9% black African; median age 36 years) were followed for a median of 5.5 years, over which time 2279 (5.1%) people died. Higher %IC was associated with lower mortality both before [relative hazard 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.88-0.95)/10% higher, P=0.0001] and after [0.90 (0.87-0.93), P=0.0001] adjustment. Adjustment for future CD4+ changes revealed that the association was explained by poorer CD4+ cell counts in those with lower %IC. In total 8730 participants under follow-up for more than 1 year initiated ART of whom 237 (2.7%) died. Higher values of %IC prior to ART initiation were associated with a reduced risk of mortality before [0.29 (0.17-0.47)/10%, P=0.0001] and after [0.36 (0.21-0.61)/10%, P=0.0002] adjustment; the association was again explained by poorer post-ART CD4+/ viral load in those with lower pre-ART %IC. Conclusions: Higher levels of engagement in-care are associated with reduced mortality at all stages of infection, including in those who initiate ART.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cohort studies", "engagement", "HIV", "mortality", "performance measures", "retention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Cohort Studies", "Delivery of Health Care", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Medication Adherence", "Mortality", "Survival Analysis", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008391801", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"56466212800": {"Name": "Sabin C.A.", "AuthorID": "56466212800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Natl.
