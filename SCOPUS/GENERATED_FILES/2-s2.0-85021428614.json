Electron spins in a range of host environments are ideal systems for representing quantum information, and such systems can be both characterized and controlled through the arsenal of pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. In this article, we introduce basic concepts behind quantum information processing with spins, including how spin decoherence (i.e., the corruption of quantum information) has been studied and mitigated in various systems; how EPR methods can be used to manipulate quantum information in spins with high fdelity; how individual spins can be used as high-resolution sensors (e.g., of magnetic field); and how multiple spins can be coupled together to develop the building blocks of a larger scale quantum computer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Decoherence", "Gate fdelity", "Quantum bit (qubit)", "Quantum information processing", "Quantum memories", "Quantum sensors", "Quantum state tomography", "Spin qubit"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021428614", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"55522483200": {"Name": "Wolfowicz G.", "AuthorID": "55522483200", "AffiliationID": "60029278", "AffiliationName": "University of Chicago"}, "55613970800": {"Name": "Morton J.J.L.", "AuthorID": "55613970800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
