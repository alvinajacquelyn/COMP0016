All rights reserved.Niche construction is a process through which organisms alter their environments and, in doing so, influence or change the selective pressures to which they are subject. \u2018Cultural niche construction\u2019 refers specifically to the effect of cultural traits on the selective environments of other biological or cultural traits and may be especially important in human evolution. In addition, the relationship between population size and cultural accumulation has been the subject of extensive debate, in part because anthropological studies have demonstrated a significant association between population size and toolkit complexity in only a subset of studied cultures. Here, we review the role of cultural innovation in constructing human evolutionary niches and introduce a new model to describe the accumulation of human cultural traits that incorporates the effects of cultural niche construction. We consider the results of this model in light of available data on human toolkit sizes across populations to help elucidate the important differences between food-gathering societies and food-producing societies, in which niche construction may be a more potent force. These results support the idea that a population\u2019s relationship with its environment, represented here by cultural niche construction, should be considered alongside population size in studies of cultural complexity.
