The nonlinear interactions between genes hinder the analytical insight into their function, usually requiring computational exploration. Here, we show that, despite the apparent complexity, the stability of the unique steady state in an incoherent feedback ring depends only on the degradation rates and a single parameter summarizing the feedback of the circuit. Concretely, we show that the range of regulatory parameters that yield oscillatory behaviour is maximized when the degradation rates are equal. Strikingly, this result holds independently of the regulatory functions used or number of genes. We also derive properties of the oscillations as a function of the degradation rates and number of nodes forming the ring. Finally, we explore the role of mRNA dynamics by applying the generic results to the specific case with two naturally different degradation timescales.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Degradation rates", "Dynamical systems", "Gene regulatory networks", "Oscillations", "Repressilator"], "IndexKeywords": ["Computational exploration", "Degradation rate", "Gene regulatory networks", "Nonlinear interactions", "Oscillations", "Regulatory functions", "Repressilator", "Sustained oscillations", "Computer Simulation", "Feedback, Physiological", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "Models, Biological", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047372343", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"57217472954": {"Name": "Page K.M.", "AuthorID": "57217472954", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35783351200": {"Name": "Perez-Carrasco R.", "AuthorID": "35783351200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
