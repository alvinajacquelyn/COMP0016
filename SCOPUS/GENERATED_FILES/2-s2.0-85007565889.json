Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting DisordersBackground: There have been a number of candidate gene association studies of cancer cachexia-related traits, but no genome-wide association study (GWAS) has been published to date. Cachexia presents in patients with a number of complex traits, including both cancer and COPD. The objective of the current investigation was to search for a shared genetic aetiology for change in body mass index (\u0394BMI) among cancer and COPD by using GWAS data in the Framingham Heart Study. Methods: A linear mixed effects model accounting for age, sex, and change in smoking status was used to calculate \u0394BMI in participants over 40 years of age with three consecutive BMI time points (n = 4162). Four GWAS of \u0394BMI using generalized estimating equations were performed among 1085 participants with a cancer diagnosis, 204 with gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, 112 with lung cancer, and 237 with COPD to test for association with 418 365 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Results: Two SNPs reached a level of genome-wide significance (P < 5 \u00d7 10\u22128) with \u0394BMI: (i) rs41526344 within the CNTN4 gene, among COPD cases (\u03b2 = 0.13, P = 4.3 \u00d7 10\u22128); and (ii) rs4751240 in the gene Dedicator of Cytokinesis 1 (DOCK1) among GI cancer cases (\u03b2 = 0.10, P = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22128). The DOCK1 SNP association replicated in the \u0394BMI GWAS among COPD cases (\u03b2meta-analyis = 0.10, Pmeta-analyis = 9.3 \u00d7 10\u221210). The DOCK1 gene codes for the dedicator of cytokinesis 1 protein, which has a role in myoblast fusion. Conclusions: In sum, one statistically significant common variant in the DOCK1 gene was associated with \u0394BMI in GI cancer and COPD cases providing support for at least partially shared aetiology of \u0394BMI in complex diseases.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BMI", "Cachexia", "Cancer", "COPD", "GWAS", "Longitudinal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Body Mass Index", "Cachexia", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Neoplasms", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive", "rac GTP-Binding Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007565889", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"23050994300": {"Name": "McDonald M.L.N.", "AuthorID": "23050994300", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60010869, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Channing Division of Network Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "26323082900": {"Name": "Castaldi P.J.", "AuthorID": "26323082900", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Primary Care and Internal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57219307474": {"Name": "Cho M.H.", "AuthorID": "57219307474", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "51863795300": {"Name": "Hardin M.", "AuthorID": "51863795300", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "6701515147": {"Name": "Hersh C.P.", "AuthorID": "6701515147", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57203069737": {"Name": "Silverman E.K.", "AuthorID": "57203069737", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "57207796874": {"Name": "Won S.", "AuthorID": "57207796874", "AffiliationID": "60013682", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health Science, Seoul National University"}, "8636730800": {"Name": "Mattheisen M.", "AuthorID": "8636730800", "AffiliationID": "60029616", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedicine and Centre for integrative Sequencing (iSEQ), Aarhus University"}, "8697498600": {"Name": "Rutten E.", "AuthorID": "8697498600", "AffiliationID": "110426005", "AffiliationName": "CIRO+, Centre of Expertise for Chronic Organ Failure"}, "35395980800": {"Name": "Wouters E.F.M.", "AuthorID": "35395980800", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Department of Respiratory Medicine, Maastricht University Medical Center Maastricht"}, "36480636400": {"Name": "Yip W.K.", "AuthorID": "36480636400", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health"}, "7202366568": {"Name": "Lange C.P.", "AuthorID": "7202366568", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health"}, "57202945380": {"Name": "Rennard S.I.", "AuthorID": "57202945380", "AffiliationID": "60010796", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, Nebraska Medical Center"}, "56892645500": {"Name": "Lomas D.A.", "AuthorID": "56892645500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Respiratory, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7101749378": {"Name": "Agusti A.", "AuthorID": "7101749378", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60010814", "AffiliationName": "Thorax Institute, Hospital Clinic-IDIBAPS, CIBERES, University of Barcelona"}, "7006672965": {"Name": "Casaburi R.", "AuthorID": "7006672965", "AffiliationID": "60016081, 60138297", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Clinical Trials Center, Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center"}, "7201936463": {"Name": "O'Connor G.", "AuthorID": "7201936463", "AffiliationID": "60006385", "AffiliationName": "Section of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine"}}}
