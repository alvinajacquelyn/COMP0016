Recent work has suggested that alterations in activity, connectivity, and structure of the cerebellum are also associated with dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by abnormal and sustained muscle contractions often leading to abnormal maintained postures. In this manuscript, the authors discuss their views on how the cerebellum may play a role in dystonia. The following topics are discussed:The relationships between neuronal/network dysfunctions and motor abnormalities in rodent models of dystonia.Data about brain structure, cerebellar metabolism, cerebellar connections, and noninvasive cerebellar stimulation that support (or not) a role for the cerebellum in human dystonia.Connections between the cerebellum and motor cortical and sub-cortical structures that could support a role for the cerebellum in dystonia. Overall points of consensus include:Neuronal dysfunction originating in the cerebellum can drive dystonic movements in rodent model systems.Imaging and neurophysiological studies in humans suggest that the cerebellum plays a role in the pathophysiology of dystonia, but do not provide conclusive evidence that the cerebellum is the primary or sole neuroanatomical site of origin.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ataxia", "Cerebellum", "Circuits", "Dystonia", "DYT1", "Networks"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cerebellum", "Dystonia", "Humans", "Neural Pathways"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991056220", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6603007723": {"Name": "Shakkottai V.G.", "AuthorID": "6603007723", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Michigan"}, "6602164026": {"Name": "Dauer W.T.", "AuthorID": "6602164026", "AffiliationID": "60033182", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan Medical School"}, "36450181000": {"Name": "Batla A.", "AuthorID": "36450181000", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London"}, "8900916900": {"Name": "Dresel C.", "AuthorID": "8900916900", "AffiliationID": "60020804", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurosciences, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research"}, "26664853900": {"Name": "Niethammer M.", "AuthorID": "26664853900", "AffiliationID": "60020804", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurosciences, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research"}, "35421524400": {"Name": "Eidelberg D.", "AuthorID": "35421524400", "AffiliationID": "60020804", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurosciences, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research"}, "6507252322": {"Name": "Raike R.S.", "AuthorID": "6507252322", "AffiliationID": "60000723", "AffiliationName": "Global Research Organization, Medtronic Inc.
