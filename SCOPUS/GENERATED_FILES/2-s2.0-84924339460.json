It is widely used as a defined and tractable C. difficile strain. Though largely similar to the ancestral strain, it demonstrates phenotypic differences that might be the result of underlying genetic changes. Here, we performed a de novo assembly based on single-molecule real-time sequencing and an analysis of major methylation patterns. Results: In addition to single nucleotide polymorphisms and various indels, we found that the mobile element CTn5 is present in the gene encoding the methyltransferase rumA rather than adhesin CD1844 where it is located in the reference strain. Conclusions: Together, the genetic features identified in this study may help to explain at least part of the phenotypic differences. The annotated genome sequence of this lab strain, including the first analysis of major methylation patterns, will be a valuable resource for genetic research on C. difficile.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conjugative transposon", "Genome sequence", "Integrative and conjugative element", "Single-molecule real-time sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Base Sequence", "Clostridium difficile", "DNA Methylation", "Drug Resistance, Microbial", "Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous", "Erythromycin", "Genome, Bacterial", "Humans", "Interspersed Repetitive Sequences", "Translocation, Genetic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924339460", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"35226660100": {"Name": "van Eijk E.", "AuthorID": "35226660100", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6603759221": {"Name": "Smits W.K.", "AuthorID": "6603759221", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Microbiology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "35503048100": {"Name": "Anvar S.Y.", "AuthorID": "35503048100", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Genome Technology Center, Human and Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56201545100": {"Name": "Frank J.", "AuthorID": "56201545100", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Genome Technology Center, Human and Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "56540848700": {"Name": "Schmitz A.M.", "AuthorID": "56540848700", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Leiden Genome Technology Center, Human and Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "55276243500": {"Name": "Browne H.P.", "AuthorID": "55276243500", "AffiliationID": "60005517", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute"}, "56540821200": {"Name": "Leung Y.Y.", "AuthorID": "56540821200", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Sequence Analysis Support Core, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "55464768800": {"Name": "Roberts A.P.", "AuthorID": "55464768800", "AffiliationID": "60013985", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial Diseases, UCL Eastman Dental Institute"}}}
