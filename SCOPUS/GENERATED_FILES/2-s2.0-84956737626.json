Herein, we infer further its molecular physiology by assessing its protective function in neurons during conditions of challenged homeostatic respiration. By adopting in vitro and in vivo protocols of hypoxia/ischemia and re-oxygenation, we show that a shift in the IF1:F1Fo-ATPsynthase expression ratio occurs in neurons. This increased IF1 level is essential to induce accumulation of the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK-1) and recruitment of the mitophagic ubiquitin ligase PARK-2 to promote autophagic \"control\" of the mitochondrial population. In IF1 overexpressing neurons ATP depletion is reduced during hypoxia/ischemia and the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394Ym) resilient to re-oxygenation as well as resistant to electrogenic, Ca2+ dependent depolarization. These data suggest that in mammalian neurons mitochondria adapt to respiratory stress by upregulating IF1, which exerts a protective role by coordinating pro-survival cell mitophagy and bioenergetics resilience.", "AuthorKeywords": ["F1Fo-ATPsynthase", "Hypoxia/ischemia", "IF1", "Mitophagy", "Re-oxygenation", "\u0394\u03a8m"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adenosine Triphosphate", "Animals", "Autophagy", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cells, Cultured", "Cerebral Cortex", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery", "Male", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Mitochondria", "Neurons", "Proteins", "Rats", "Up-Regulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84956737626", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"54403377900": {"Name": "Martin-Jimenez R.", "AuthorID": "54403377900", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "56425503500": {"Name": "Crosby J.", "AuthorID": "56425503500", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "7401530821": {"Name": "Russell C.", "AuthorID": "7401530821", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, Royal Veterinary College, University of London"}, "7003987654": {"Name": "Campanella M.", "AuthorID": "7003987654", "AffiliationID": "60014262", "AffiliationName": "Regina Elena-National Cancer Institute"}, "56653239000": {"Name": "Matic I.", "AuthorID": "56653239000", "AffiliationID": "60027509", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of Rome tor Vergata"}, "55558532500": {"Name": "Ferraina C.", "AuthorID": "55558532500", "AffiliationID": "60014262", "AffiliationName": "Regina Elena-National Cancer Institute"}, "57197611346": {"Name": "Cocco S.", "AuthorID": "57197611346", "AffiliationID": "60081921", "AffiliationName": "EBRI-European Brain Research Institute"}, "55631028900": {"Name": "Florenzano F.", "AuthorID": "55631028900", "AffiliationID": "60081921", "AffiliationName": "EBRI-European Brain Research Institute"}, "57091369800": {"Name": "Lupi R.", "AuthorID": "57091369800", "AffiliationID": "60081921", "AffiliationName": "EBRI-European Brain Research Institute"}, "57212090083": {"Name": "Amadoro G.", "AuthorID": "57212090083", "AffiliationID": "60081921", "AffiliationName": "EBRI-European Brain Research Institute"}, "6603543769": {"Name": "Pignataro G.", "AuthorID": "6603543769", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005701507": {"Name": "Annunziato L.", "AuthorID": "7005701507", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7102348938": {"Name": "Abramov A.Y.", "AuthorID": "7102348938", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}}}
