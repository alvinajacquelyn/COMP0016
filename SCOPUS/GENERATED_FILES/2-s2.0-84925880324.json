Community mobilisation through participatory women's groups has been shown to improve maternal and newborn health in rural settings, but little is known about the potential of this approach to improve care and health in children after the newborn period. Methods: Following on from a cluster-randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of participatory women's groups on maternal and neonatal health outcomes in rural Bangladesh, 162 women's groups continued to meet between April 2010 and December 2011 to identify, prioritise and address issues that affect the health of children under 5 years. A controlled beforeand- after study design and difference-in-difference analysis was used to assess morbidity outcomes and changes in knowledge and practices related to child feeding, hygiene and care-seeking behaviour. Findings: Significant improvements were measured in mothers' knowledge of disease prevention and management, danger signs and hand washing at critical times. Significant increases were seen in exclusive breast feeding for at least 6 months (15.3% (4.2% to 26.5%)), and mean duration of breast feeding (37.9 days (17.4 to 58.3)). Maternal reports of under-5 morbidities fell in intervention compared with control areas, including reports of fever (-10.5% (-15.1% to -6.0%)) and acute respiratory infections (-12.2% (-15.6% to -8.8%)). No differences were observed in dietary diversity scores or immunisation uptake. Conclusions: Community mobilisation through participatory women's groups can be successfully adapted to address health knowledge and practice in relation to child's health, leading to improvements in a number of child health indicators and behaviours.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Bangladesh", "Breast Feeding", "Child Health", "Child Nutrition Sciences", "Child, Preschool", "Consumer Participation", "Controlled Before-After Studies", "Educational Status", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant Health", "Male", "Maternal Age", "Mothers", "Program Evaluation", "Regression Analysis", "Women", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925880324", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"53864334800": {"Name": "Younes L.", "AuthorID": "53864334800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "10639726000": {"Name": "Houweling T.", "AuthorID": "10639726000", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, ErasmusMC University Medical Center Rotterdam"}, "53863135500": {"Name": "Beard J.", "AuthorID": "53863135500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "23095622300": {"Name": "Prost A.", "AuthorID": "23095622300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "54790609700": {"Name": "Costello A.", "AuthorID": "54790609700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "16021923800": {"Name": "Fottrell E.", "AuthorID": "16021923800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "24778254000": {"Name": "Azad K.", "AuthorID": "24778254000", "AffiliationID": "60022309", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Care Project (PCP), Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (BADAS)"}, "53863903800": {"Name": "Kuddus A.", "AuthorID": "53863903800", "AffiliationID": "60022309", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Care Project (PCP), Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (BADAS)"}, "36106472500": {"Name": "Shaha S.", "AuthorID": "36106472500", "AffiliationID": "60022309", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Care Project (PCP), Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (BADAS)"}, "53863646200": {"Name": "Haq B.", "AuthorID": "53863646200", "AffiliationID": "60022309", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Care Project (PCP), Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (BADAS)"}, "53863924200": {"Name": "Nahar T.", "AuthorID": "53863924200", "AffiliationID": "60022309", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Care Project (PCP), Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (BADAS)"}, "55846159800": {"Name": "Hossen M.", "AuthorID": "55846159800", "AffiliationID": "60022309", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal Care Project (PCP), Diabetic Association of Bangladesh (BADAS)"}, "7003490365": {"Name": "Copas A.", "AuthorID": "7003490365", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}}}
