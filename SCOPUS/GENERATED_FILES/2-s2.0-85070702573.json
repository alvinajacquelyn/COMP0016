The Alzheimer's A\u03b2 peptide and human amylin (h-amylin), the polypeptide responsible for amyloid formation in type-2 diabetes, share common physio-chemical features and some inhibitors of A\u03b2 also inhibit amyloid formation by h-amylin and vice versa. Thus, a popular and potentially useful strategy to find lead compounds for anti-amylin amyloid agents is to examine compounds that have effects on A\u03b2 amyloid formation. The triphenylmethane dye, brilliant blue G (BBG, Sodium;3-[[4-[(E)-[4-(4-ethoxyanilino)phenyl]-[4-[ethyl-[(3-sulfonatophenyl)methyl]azaniumylidene]- 2-methylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-ylidene]methyl]-N-ethyl-3-methylanilino]methyl] benzenesulfonate) has been shown to modulate A\u03b2 amyloid formation and inhibit A\u03b2 induced toxicity. However, the effects of BBG on h-amylin have not been examined, although other triphenylmethane derivatives inhibit h-amylin amyloid formation. The compound has only a modest impact on h-amylin amyloid formation unless it is added in significant excess. BBG also remodels preformed h-amylin amyloid fibrils if added in excess, however BBG has no significant effect on h-amylin induced toxicity towards cultured \u03b2-cells or cultured CHO-T cells except at high concentrations. BBG is shown to interfere with standard thioflavin-T assays of h-amylin amyloid formation and disaggregation, highlighting the difficulty of interpreting such experiments in the absence of other measurements. BBG also interferes with ANS based assays of h-amylin amyloid formation. The work highlights the differences between inhibition of A\u03b2 and h-amylin amyloid formation, illustrates the limitation of using A\u03b2 inhibitors as leads for h-amylin amyloid inhibitors, and reinforces the difficulties in interpreting dye binding assays of amyloid formation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amylin Receptor Agonists", "Amyloid", "Anilino Naphthalenesulfonates", "Benzothiazoles", "Biological Assay", "Drug Design", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Indicators and Reagents", "Islet Amyloid Polypeptide", "Rosaniline Dyes", "Trityl Compounds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070702573", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"54906999800": {"Name": "Akter R.", "AuthorID": "54906999800", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "57193425573": {"Name": "Zheng B.", "AuthorID": "57193425573", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "57188999900": {"Name": "Bhatia S.R.", "AuthorID": "57188999900", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "7006500064": {"Name": "Raleigh D.P.", "AuthorID": "7006500064", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6602909082": {"Name": "Zhyvoloup A.", "AuthorID": "6602909082", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
