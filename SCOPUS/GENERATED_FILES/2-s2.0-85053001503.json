All rights reserved.Paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM) refers to band-like hyperreflective lesions seen on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, mostly confined to the inner nuclear layer. It has been previously demonstrated to involve the deep capillary plexus (DCP) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). A 29-year-old female presented with PAMM and was investigated using a new OCTA system that shows not just the superficial capillary plexus and DCP, but also the four vascular plexuses as previously demonstrated in histology. Using this system, involvement of the DCP was shown, but also of more superficial layers, including the intermediate capillary plexus.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adult", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Retinal Diseases", "Retinal Vessels", "Tomography, Optical Coherence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053001503", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"55820358700": {"Name": "Schwartz R.", "AuthorID": "55820358700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7003429874": {"Name": "Hykin P.", "AuthorID": "7003429874", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
