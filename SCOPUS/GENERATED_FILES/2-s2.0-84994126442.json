All rights reserved.Three models have been proposed to explain the temporal interrelation between self-esteem and symptoms of depression: vulnerability (self-esteem predicts future depressive symptoms), scar (depressive symptoms predict future self-esteem), and reciprocal risk (self-esteem and depressive symptoms predict each other in the future). This study tested these three models over 25 years in a sample of high school seniors surveyed six times from age 18 to 43 (n = 978). Autoregressive crosslagged modeling revealed that self-esteem and symptoms of depression prospectively predicted each other at every measurement occasion. Additionally, the cross-lagged association from selfesteem to symptoms of depression and the corresponding link from depressive symptoms to future self-esteem were equally strong. These results provide support for the reciprocal risk model.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depressive symptoms", "Longitudinal", "Mental health", "Reciprocal risk", "Scar model", "Self-esteem", "Vulnerability model"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994126442", "SubjectAreas": [["Life-span and Life-course Studies", "SOCI", "3319"]], "AuthorData": {"57199172489": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "57199172489", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta"}, "35579586900": {"Name": "Galambos N.", "AuthorID": "35579586900", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta"}, "7003518412": {"Name": "Krahn H.", "AuthorID": "7003518412", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "University of Alberta"}}}
