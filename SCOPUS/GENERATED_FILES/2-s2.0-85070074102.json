Recent Findings: Advances in imaging have led to earlier identification, improved diagnosis of CA and higher discriminatory power to differentiate CA from other hypertrophic phenocopies. The application of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) has led to a deeper understanding of underlying pathophysiological processes in CA, owing largely to its intrinsic tissue characterization properties. The widespread adoption of bone scintigraphy algorithms has reduced the need for cardiac biopsy and improved diagnostic confidence in ATTR CA. Summary: As new treatments for CA are rapidly developing, there will be even greater reliance on imaging, as the requirement to diagnose disease earlier, monitor response and amend treatment strategies accordingly intensifies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac amyloidosis", "Cardiomyopathy", "Echocardiography", "Immunoglobulin light chain", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Transthyretin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloid Neuropathies, Familial", "Amyloidosis", "Biopsy", "Cardiomyopathies", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin Light Chains"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070074102", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57210256202": {"Name": "Chacko L.", "AuthorID": "57210256202", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "16306839900": {"Name": "Fontana M.", "AuthorID": "16306839900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Amyloidosis Centre, University College London"}, "57200571622": {"Name": "Martone R.", "AuthorID": "57200571622", "AffiliationID": "60021921", "AffiliationName": "Tuscan Regional Amyloid Center, Careggi University Hospital"}, "11541161800": {"Name": "Cappelli F.", "AuthorID": "11541161800", "AffiliationID": "60021921", "AffiliationName": "Tuscan Regional Amyloid Center, Careggi University Hospital"}}}
