Dynamic dialogue between all parties has been encouraged throughout the research process (January\u2013December 2015). From our viewpoints, discursive differences and occasional disciplinary dilemmas are regarded as potentially knowledge producing. We share transcribed parts of our critical conversations to illustrate how evaluating dance as PA represents opportunities for challenging if not disrupting some discursive terrain, whilst concurrently being somewhat constrained by that terrain. Our broader research remit contributes to ongoing debates surrounding \u2018what works\u2019 in relation to PA. Our dynamic interactions are thus constitutive of and productive within wider circuits or discourses of policy and provision. Paradigmatic rivalry or epistemological \u2018tensions\u2019 may well be hindering attempts to demonstrate that dance does have positive impacts on health. Acknowledgement and engagement with these tensions can arguably inform policy and practice in effective and meaningful ways and contribute further to debates regarding an evidence base seeking to \u2018prove\u2019 the benefits of activity-based programmes and interventions as we look across PA, PH and sport.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dance", "physical activity", "public health", "sport", "worldviews"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994155169", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["Tourism, Leisure and Hospitality Management", "BUSI", "1409"]], "AuthorData": {"25522927500": {"Name": "Watson B.", "AuthorID": "25522927500", "AffiliationID": "60032773", "AffiliationName": "Carnegie School of Sport, Leeds Beckett University"}, "12802581300": {"Name": "Lashua B.", "AuthorID": "12802581300", "AffiliationID": "60032773", "AffiliationName": "Carnegie School of Sport, Leeds Beckett University"}, "24781335100": {"Name": "Trevorrow P.", "AuthorID": "24781335100", "AffiliationID": "60032773", "AffiliationName": "Carnegie School of Sport, Leeds Beckett University"}}}
