Published by Cambridge University Press.The aim of this study was to examine cross-sectionally whether higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) might favorably modify amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2)-related decrements in cognition in a cohort of late-middle-aged adults at risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sixty-nine enrollees in the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention participated in this study. They completed a comprehensive neuropsychological exam, underwent 11C Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET imaging, and performed a graded treadmill exercise test to volitional exhaustion. Peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) during the exercise test was used as the index of CRF. Forty-five participants also underwent lumbar puncture for collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, from which A\u03b242 was immunoassayed. Covariate-adjusted regression analyses were used to test whether the association between A\u03b2 and cognition was modified by CRF. There were significant VO2peak\u2217PiB-PET interactions for Immediate Memory (p=.041) and Verbal Learning & Memory (p=.025). There were also significant VO2peak\u2217CSF A\u03b242 interactions for Immediate Memory (p<.001) and Verbal Learning & Memory (p<.001). Specifically, in the context of high A\u03b2 burden, that is, increased PiB-PET binding or reduced CSF A\u03b242, individuals with higher CRF exhibited significantly better cognition compared with individuals with lower CRF. In a late-middle-aged, at-risk cohort, higher CRF is associated with a diminution of A\u03b2-related effects on cognition. These findings suggest that exercise might play an important role in the prevention of AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Cognition", "Neuroimaging",
