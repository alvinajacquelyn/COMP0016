Most important is estrogen receptor-a (ER\u03b1), which is a key therapeutic target. ER\u03b1 action is facilitated by co-operativity with other NR and there is evidence that ER\u03b1 function may be recapitulated by other NRs in ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer. In order to examine the inter-relationships between nuclear receptors, and to obtain evidence for previously unsuspected roles for any NRs, we undertook quantitative RT-PCR and bioinformatics analysis to examine their expression in breast cancer. While most NRs were expressed, bioinformatic analyses differentiated tumours into distinct prognostic groups that were validated by analyzing public microarray data sets. Although ER\u03b1 and progesterone receptor were dominant in distinguishing prognostic groups, other NR strengthened these groups. Clustering analysis identified several family members with potential importance in breast cancer. Specifically, ROR\u03b3 is identified as being co-expressed with ER\u03b1, whilst several NRs are preferentially expressed in ER\u03b1-negative disease, with TLX expression being prognostic in this subtype. Functional studies demonstrated the importance of TLX in regulating growth and invasion in ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Cancer", "Expression
