The purpose of the current study was to examine associations of these two factors with unhealthy snacking among adolescents. We also investigated whether self-regulatory competence could attenuate the negative effects of being sensitive to the food environment. Methods: A survey was completed by 11,392 European adolescents (10-17. years old). The survey measured psychological sensitivity to the food environment, self-regulatory competence and self-reported unhealthy snack intake. Results: Higher food environment sensitivity and lower self-regulatory competence were associated with more unhealthy snacking. The two factors also interacted, with self-regulatory competence attenuating the influence of high food environment sensitivity. Discussion: Adolescents who are sensitive to the food environment reported higher unhealthy snack intake. More frequent use of self-regulation strategies on the other hand was associated with lower unhealthy snack intake. Moreover, self-regulatory competence was found to moderate the influence of psychological sensitivity to the food environment on unhealthy snacking, although the effect size was small. Fostering adolescents' self-regulatory competence can help enable them to better navigate the obesogenic environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Eating behavior", "Obesogenic environment", "Power of food", "Self-regulation", "Snacking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Environment", "Female", "Food", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Male", "Obesity", "Self Report", "Self-Control", "Snacks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84918497126", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"35747499200": {"Name": "Stok F.", "AuthorID": "35747499200", "AffiliationID": "60025525", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Assessment and Health Psychology, University of Konstanz"}, "55230438400": {"Name": "De Ridder D.", "AuthorID": "55230438400", "AffiliationID": "60007989", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Health Psychology, Utrecht University"}, "8602677400": {"Name": "De Vet E.", "AuthorID": "8602677400", "AffiliationID": "60004156", "AffiliationName": "Communication, Philosophy and Technology, Centre for Integrative Development, Wageningen University and Research Centre"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "56447848300": {"Name": "Chu M.", "AuthorID": "56447848300", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, City University London"}, "24544594300": {"Name": "De Wit J.", "AuthorID": "24544594300", "AffiliationID": "60087845, 60028333", "AffiliationName": "National Centre in HIV Social Research, University of New South Wales"}}}
