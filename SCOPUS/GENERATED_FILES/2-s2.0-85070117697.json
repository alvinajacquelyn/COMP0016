Methods: Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Adjusted multinomial logistic regressions were carried out to quantify associations between levels of self-reported active transport (or LTPA) and quintiles of anthropometric measures and serum markers. Results: A total of 3248 adults were included. For serum inflammatory biomarkers, the authors observed a lower likelihood of being in the top quintile groups of circulating C-reactive protein (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40\u20130.90) and white blood cell count (aOR: 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44\u20130.95) with engaging in low to medium levels of active transport but not with high levels of active transport. Higher levels of LTPA were associated with lower likelihood of having high levels of serum inflammatory biomarkers (aOR: 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42\u20130.86 in the top C-reactive protein group and aOR: 0.58; 95% CI, 0.39\u20130.87 in top white blood cell group). Conclusions: Promoting active transport and/or LTPA may be a beneficial strategy to improving some, but not all, cardiometabolic health outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropometric", "Cycling", "Walking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Biological Transport, Active", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Leisure Activities", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Nutrition Surveys", "United States", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070117697", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"37117793800": {"Name": "Smith L.", "AuthorID": "37117793800", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57204891343": {"Name": "Stubbs B.", "AuthorID": "57204891343", "AffiliationID": "60170475, 60000913", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "56612611500": {"Name": "Hu L.", "AuthorID": "56612611500", "AffiliationID": "60003970", "AffiliationName": "Department of Sport Science, Zhejiang University"}, "36998781200": {"Name": "Veronese N.", "AuthorID": "36998781200", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche Area della Ricerca di Padova, Neuroscience Institute"}, "26326634000": {"Name": "Vancampfort D.", "AuthorID": "26326634000", "AffiliationID": "60025063, 60031069", "AffiliationName": "Vancampfort, University Psychiatric Centre, Catholic University Leuven"}, "55469265700": {"Name": "Williams G.", "AuthorID": "55469265700", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport and Health Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "57199509236": {"Name": "Vicinanza D.", "AuthorID": "57199509236", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing and Technology, Anglia Ruskin University"}, "57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.E.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, UCL"}, "57210266730": {"Name": "Ying L.", "AuthorID": "57210266730", "AffiliationID": "60017060, 60121899", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Management, Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University"}, "56371435100": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1nchez G.F.", "AuthorID": "56371435100", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Sport Sciences, University of Murcia"}, "57189045362": {"Name": "Yang L.", "AuthorID": "57189045362", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Center for Public Health"}}}
