Methods and Study Design: Patients with cancer at 3 hospitals completed a self-Administered DCE. Each scenario described 6 attributes: expertise of health care professionals (HCPs), familiarity of doctors with patients' medical history, waiting time, accompaniment by family/friends, travel time, and out-of-pocket costs. Patient preferences were estimated using logistic regression. Willingness to pay (WTP) estimates were derived from regression coefficients. Results: Of 512 patients contacted, 185 returned the questionnaire. The mean age was 61 years, and 60% of respondents were female. The mean time since cancer diagnosis was 34 months, 90% had received treatment; and 61% had early-stage disease. The most important attributes were expertise and familiarity of doctors with patients' medical history; distance traveled was least likely to influence patient preferences. The WTP analysis estimated that patients were willing to pay 680 (95% CI, 470-891) for an appointment with a specialist, 571 (95% CI, 388-754) for doctors familiar with their history, 422 (95% CI, 262-582) for shorter waiting times, 399 (95% CI, 249-549) to be accompanied by family/friends, and 301 (95% CI, 162-441) for shorter traveling times. Male patients had a stronger preference for accompaniment by family/friends. The expertise of HCP was the most important attribute for patients regardless of geographic remoteness. Conclusions: Our study can assist the development of patient-centered health care models that improve patient access to experienced HCPs, support the role of primary care providers during the cancer journey, and educate patients about the roles of non-oncology HCPs to cope with increasing demand for cancer care.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Appointments and Schedules", "Choice Behavior", "Female", "Health Expenditures", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Patient Preference", "Patient-Centered Care", "Physicians, Primary Care", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961578446", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"55347448500": {"Name": "Wong S.F.", "AuthorID": "55347448500", "AffiliationID": "114582642", "AffiliationName": "Andrew Love Cancer Centre, University Hospital Geelong"}, "35398013700": {"Name": "Ashley D.M.", "AuthorID": "35398013700", "AffiliationID": "114582642", "AffiliationName": "Andrew Love Cancer Centre, University Hospital Geelong"}, "24070765500": {"Name": "Khasraw M.", "AuthorID": "24070765500", "AffiliationID": "114582642", "AffiliationName": "Andrew Love Cancer Centre, University Hospital Geelong"}, "24833636500": {"Name": "Norman R.", "AuthorID": "24833636500", "AffiliationID": "60031226, 60090173", "AffiliationName": "School of Public Health, Curtin University"}, "54388754100": {"Name": "Dunning T.L.", "AuthorID": "54388754100", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Midwifery, University Hospital Geelong, Deakin University"}, "57188558276": {"Name": "Hayes T.M.", "AuthorID": "57188558276", "AffiliationID": "60027660", "AffiliationName": "St John of God Hospital"}, "55930892800": {"Name": "Collins I.", "AuthorID": "55930892800", "AffiliationID": "60018805", "AffiliationName": "Greater Green Triangle Clinical School, Deakin University School of Medicine"}, "14038950500": {"Name": "Lorgelly P.K.", "AuthorID": "14038950500", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Health Economics, Monash University"}}}
