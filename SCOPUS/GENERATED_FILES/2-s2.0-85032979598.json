It compared linguistic outcomes from two different approaches, one which emphasized oracy and the other which combined literacy with attention to oracy development. We also explored the relationship between linguistic outcomes and other teaching/teacher factors: teaching time, teacher level of French proficiency, and teacher level of training in language instruction. Learners completed a sentence repetition task and a photo description task, making small but statistically significant progress in both grammatical and lexical knowledge between test points. While teaching approach had little impact on such progress, other teaching and teacher factors did, particularly the French proficiency level of the primary school teacher and the amount of teaching time devoted to French.", "AuthorKeywords": ["early language learning", "teacher proficiency", "teacher training", "teaching approach", "teaching time"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032979598", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"13805879600": {"Name": "Graham S.", "AuthorID": "13805879600", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}, "57188816615": {"Name": "Courtney L.", "AuthorID": "57188816615", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}, "12753856900": {"Name": "Marinis T.", "AuthorID": "12753856900", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}, "6505903439": {"Name": "Tonkyn A.", "AuthorID": "6505903439", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "University of Reading"}}}
