KGaA, WeinheimThin layers of highly conductive graphitic carbon are deposited onto nickel-plated steel substrates using a direct photothermal chemical vapor deposition (PTCVD) technique. The coated nickel-plated steel substrates improve electrical properties (sheet resistance and interfacial contact resistance [ICR]) compared with pristine nickel-plated steel, which makes it a cost-effective alternative to stainless steel for steel producers to use in high-end electrical applications such as energy storage and microelectronics. The coated nickel-plated steel is found to have \u224810% reduction in sheet resistance and 200 times reduction in ICR (under compression at 140 N cm\u22122), compared with pristine nickel-plated steel. ICR is also three times lower than that of a benchmark gold-coated stainless steel equivalent at the same pressure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["coatings", "electrical properties", "graphitic carbon", "nickel-plated steel", "photothermal chemical vapor deposition"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost effective", "Electrical applications", "Graphitic carbons", "Interfacial contact resistance", "Photo-thermal", "Steel producers", "Steel substrate", "Thin layers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071226270", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57202566890": {"Name": "Mills C.A.", "AuthorID": "57202566890", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "56706599600": {"Name": "Ahmad M.", "AuthorID": "56706599600", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "57200624098": {"Name": "Legge E.J.", "AuthorID": "57200624098", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Surface Technology Group, Chemical and Biological Sciences Department, National Physical Laboratory"}, "7203043276": {"Name": "Silva S.R.P.", "AuthorID": "7203043276", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Technology Institute, University of Surrey"}, "6507600774": {"Name": "Batyrev E.", "AuthorID": "6507600774", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel, Research and Development, Ijmuiden Technology Centre"}, "57210697176": {"Name": "Jansen M.J.R.", "AuthorID": "57210697176", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel, Research and Development, Ijmuiden Technology Centre"}, "6507426054": {"Name": "van der Weijde H.", "AuthorID": "6507426054", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel, Research and Development, Ijmuiden Technology Centre"}, "57209848408": {"Name": "Pathan T.S.", "AuthorID": "57209848408", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57220479940": {"Name": "Thakur D.B.", "AuthorID": "57220479940", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel, Research and Development, Warwick Technology Centre"}, "57215453488": {"Name": "Patole S.N.", "AuthorID": "57215453488", "AffiliationID": "60003430", "AffiliationName": "Tata Steel, Research and Development, Warwick Technology Centre"}}}
