Objective: To estimate performance of newborn screening for CH at different test thresholds and calculate incidence of primary CH. Design: Prospective surveillance from June 2011 to June 2012 with 3-year follow-up of outcomes. Relative likelihood ratios (rLRs) estimated to compare bloodspot TSH test thresholds of 6 mU/L and 8 mU/L, with the nationally recommended standard of 10 mU/L for a presumptive positive result. Setting: UK National Health Service. Patients: Clinician notification of children aged ,5 years investigated following clinical presentation or presumptive positive screening result. Main Outcome Measure(s): Permanent primary CH status determined by clinician report of continuing T4 requirement at 3-year follow-up. Results: A total of 629 newborns (58.3% girls; 58.7% white ethnicity) were investigated following presumptive positive screening result and 21 children (52.4% girls; 52.4% white) after clinical presentation; 432 remained on treatment at 3-year follow-up. Permanent CH incidence was 5.3 (95% CI, 4.8 to 5.8) per 10,000 infants. With use of locally applied thresholds, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value were 96.76%, 99.97%, and 66.88%, respectively. Compared with a TSH threshold of 10 mU/L, positive rLRs for 8 mU/L and 6 mU/L were 1.20 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.75) and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.38 to 0.72), and negative rLRs were 0.11 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.36) and 0.11 (95% CI, 0.06 to 0.20), respectively. Conclusions: Screening program performance is good, but a TSH threshold of 8 mU/L appears superior to the current national standard (10 mU/L) and requires further evaluation. Further research should explore the implications of transient CH for screening policy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Congenital Hypothyroidism", "Diagnostic Techniques, Endocrine", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "National Health Programs", "Neonatal Screening", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Thyrotropin"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054441370", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"14030185000": {"Name": "Knowles R.L.", "AuthorID": "14030185000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Life Course Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6603254915": {"Name": "Oerton J.", "AuthorID": "6603254915", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Life Course Epidemiology and Biostatistics, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7004649526": {"Name": "Cheetham T.", "AuthorID": "7004649526", "AffiliationID": "60006222, 60024240", "AffiliationName": "Newcastle University and Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Royal Victoria Infirmary"}, "7101909468": {"Name": "Butler G.", "AuthorID": "7101909468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric and Adolescent Endocrinology, Univ.
