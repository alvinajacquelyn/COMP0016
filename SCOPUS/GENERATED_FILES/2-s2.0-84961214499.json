All rights reserved.Background The HLA-DRB\u22171501 haplotype influences the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), but it is not known how it affects grey matter pathology. Aim To assess HLA-DRB\u22171501 effects on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cortical grey matter pathology. Methods Whole and lesional cortical grey matter volumes, lesional and normal-appearing grey matter magnetization transfer ratio were measured in 85 people with MS and 36 healthy control subjects. HLA-DRB\u22171501 haplotype was determined by genotyping (rs3135388). Results No significant differences were observed in MRI measures between the HLA-DRB\u22171501 subgroups. Conclusions The HLA-DRB\u22171501 haplotype is not strongly associated with MRI-visible grey matter pathology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cortical lesion", "Grey matter", "HLA-DRB\u22171501", "Magnetization transfer ratio", "Multiple sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Cerebral Cortex", "Disability Evaluation", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Gray Matter", "Haplotypes", "HLA-DRB1 Chains", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Organ Size", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961214499", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"24460802000": {"Name": "Yaldizli \u00d6.", "AuthorID": "24460802000", "AffiliationID": "60028287", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Basel"}, "55317343100": {"Name": "Sethi V.", "AuthorID": "55317343100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square MS Centre, NMR Research Unit, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "23493507300": {"Name": "Pardini M.", "AuthorID": "23493507300", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health, University of Genoa"}, "24463840100": {"Name": "Tur C.", "AuthorID": "24463840100", "AffiliationID": "60012486", "AffiliationName": "MS Centre of Catalonia (Cemcat), Neurology-Neuroimmunology Department, Vall d'Hebron University Hospital"}, "36010957200": {"Name": "Muhlert N.", "AuthorID": "36010957200", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester"}, "52463965100": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "52463965100", "AffiliationID": "60080985, 60026707", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical University"}, "12787588000": {"Name": "Samson R.S.", "AuthorID": "12787588000", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square MS Centre, NMR Research Unit, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6602501665": {"Name": "Wheeler-Kingshott C.A.M.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Queen Square MS Centre, NMR Research Unit, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57202559286": {"Name": "Miller D.H.", "AuthorID": "57202559286", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), University College London Hospitals (UCLH), Biomedical Research Centre"}, "7004057758": {"Name": "Chard D.T.", "AuthorID": "7004057758", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), University College London Hospitals (UCLH), Biomedical Research Centre"}, "36437536800": {"Name": "Mok K.Y.", "AuthorID": "36437536800", "AffiliationID": "60008592", "AffiliationName": "Division of Life Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56210513900": {"Name": "Hardy J.", "AuthorID": "56210513900", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
