Methods: This was a consecutive case series of 244 eyes with dry/stable wet AMD and logMAR visual acuity \u22650.3 implanted with iolAMD Eyemax monoTM (London Eye Hospital Pharma), a single-piece, injectable, hydrophobic acrylic IOL sited in the capsular bag. Primary outcome was safety. Secondary outcomes were changes in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and corrected near visual acuity (CNVA) (logMAR). Results: Mean age at surgery was 80 years. Mean duration of follow-up was 3 months (range 1-16 months). No eyes had worsening of CDVA. Frequency of perioperative complications was equivalent to standard IOL implantation. Postoperative refractive outcomes were within \u00b11 D of the target refraction in 88% of cases. Mean preoperative CDVA improved from 1.06 to 0.71 postoperatively (mean of differences -0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.3886 to -0.3223; p<0.0001), equating to an approximate Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study gain of 18 letters. Mean preoperative CNVA (N-point; logMAR conversion) improved from 1.36 to 0.88 postoperatively (mean of differences -0.48; 95% CI -0.53 to -0.44; p<0.0001). Conclusions: This novel IOL appears safe in the short to medium term. Improvements in postoperative CDVA and CNVA exceed those observed with standard implants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Cataract", "Eccentric fixation", "Intraocular lens", "Macular degeneration", "Preferred retinal locus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cataract", "Female", "Geographic Atrophy", "Humans", "Lens Implantation, Intraocular", "Lenses, Intraocular", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Phacoemulsification", "Postoperative Complications", "Pseudophakia", "Retina", "Visual Acuity", "Wet Macular Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046853805", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"53064566800": {"Name": "Qureshi M.", "AuthorID": "53064566800", "AffiliationID": "102026941", "AffiliationName": "London Eye Hospital"}, "14420317400": {"Name": "Robbie S.", "AuthorID": "14420317400", "AffiliationID": "102026941", "AffiliationName": "London Eye Hospital"}, "24472554300": {"Name": "Hengerer F.", "AuthorID": "24472554300", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Heidelberg"}, "7004509773": {"Name": "Auffarth G.", "AuthorID": "7004509773", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Heidelberg"}, "36551038000": {"Name": "Conrad-Hengerer I.", "AuthorID": "36551038000", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Heidelberg"}, "7005968116": {"Name": "Artal P.", "AuthorID": "7005968116", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Optics Laboratory, University of Murcia"}}}
