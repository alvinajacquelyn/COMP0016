We assessed the effects of changes in land-use on the lowland avifauna of the tropical island of Makira in the Solomon Islands. We examined species richness and community assemblages, with a particular focus on endemism and functional traits, to provide further insight into the conservation value of the dominant types of land-use on Makira (i.e. intact forest, secondary forest, food gardens, mixed Cocoa plantations, and monoculture Cocoa plantations). We found species richness was similar across habitats, but endemic-species richness decreased as intensity of land-use increased. There were significant differences in the occurrence of functional groups between habitats. Fifteen of the 42 species observed showed significant variation in abundance across habitats. Of those species that varied, 12 were endemic to Makira or to Melanesia, with seven of these endemics being absent from the monoculture Cocoa plantations. As tropical islands have less functional redundancy than continental land masses, protecting the remaining forest and improving habitat connectivity will be even more critical for conserving their endemic species and maintaining ecosystem functioning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biodiversity", "cash crops", "conservation", "Melanesia", "tropical forest."], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937919269", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Animal Science and Zoology", "AGRI", "1103"], ["Nature and Landscape Conservation", "ENVI", "2309"]], "AuthorData": {"52363558000": {"Name": "Davies T.E.", "AuthorID": "52363558000", "AffiliationID": "60003122", "AffiliationName": "University of Victoria, School of Environmental Studies"}, "7403070847": {"Name": "Clarke R.H.", "AuthorID": "7403070847", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, Building 18, Clayton Campus, Monash University"}, "7005260657": {"Name": "Ewen J.G.", "AuthorID": "7005260657", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "6507067705": {"Name": "Fazey I.R.A.", "AuthorID": "6507067705", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "School of the Environment, University of Dundee"}, "7003354067": {"Name": "Cresswell W.", "AuthorID": "7003354067", "AffiliationID": "60022132", "AffiliationName": "School of Biology, University of St.Andrews"}}}
