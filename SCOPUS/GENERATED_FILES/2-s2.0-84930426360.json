Comparison of retrievals with different stem types can provide the opportunity to understand the importance of the taper junction. This was a case-control study involving 20 retrieved 36 mm metal-on-metal Pinnacle (DePuy) hips that were paired with either a Corail (n = 10) or S-ROM (n = 10) stem. The median head taper material loss rate for the Corail group was 0.238 (0.0002-2.178) mm3/year and was significantly greater than the S-ROM group (p = 0.042), which had a median material loss rate of 0.132 (0.015-0.518) mm3/year. The only significant difference between the groups was the stem taper roughness and length: this was rougher and shorter for the Corails. Long and smooth stem taper designs are preferred when used in conjunction with metal heads.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomedical devices", "hip prostheses", "medical biomaterials", "orthopaedic tribology", "Wear analysis/testing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical devices", "Case-control study", "Material loss", "Metal-on-metal", "Smooth stems", "Stem taper", "Wear analysis", "Adult", "Aged", "Equipment Failure Analysis", "Female", "Friction", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Metal-on-Metal Joint Prostheses", "Metals", "Middle Aged", "Particle Size", "Prosthesis Design", "Surface Properties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930426360", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"6506962865": {"Name": "Hothi H.S.", "AuthorID": "6506962865", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "55982205200": {"Name": "Whittaker R.K.", "AuthorID": "55982205200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "6507418782": {"Name": "Meswania J.M.", "AuthorID": "6507418782", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "7004735871": {"Name": "Blunn G.W.", "AuthorID": "7004735871", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "8281611700": {"Name": "Skinner J.A.", "AuthorID": "8281611700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60024067", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Science, University College London, Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}}}
