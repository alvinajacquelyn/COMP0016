Whilst several methods exist for the site-selective introduction of a single chemical moiety, site-selective and bioorthogonal dual modification of biomolecules remains a challenge. The introduction of multiple modules enables a plethora of permutations and combinations and can generate a variety of bioconjuguates with many potential applications. From de novo approaches on oligomers to the post-translational functionalisation of proteins, this review will highlight the main strategies to dually modify biomolecules.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bioorthogonal reactions", "Chemical moieties", "Functionalisation", "Permutations and combinations", "Site selective", "Click Chemistry", "Models, Molecular", "Oligonucleotides", "Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976871510", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"55693565400": {"Name": "Maruani A.", "AuthorID": "55693565400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57037847400": {"Name": "Richards D.", "AuthorID": "57037847400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24536976100": {"Name": "Chudasama V.", "AuthorID": "24536976100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
