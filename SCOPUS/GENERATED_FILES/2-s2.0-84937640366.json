Published by Elsevier Ltd.Purpose: To explore public attitudes towards modifying frequency of mammography screening based on genetic risk. Methods: Home-based interviews were carried out with a population-based sample of 942 women aged 18-74 years in the UK. Demographic characteristics and perceived breast cancer (BC) risk were examined as predictors of support for risk-stratified BC screening and of the acceptability of raised or lowered screening frequency based on genetic risk, using multivariate logistic regression. Results: Over two-thirds of respondents (65.8%) supported the idea of varying screening frequency on the basis of genetic risk. The majority (85.4%) were willing to have more frequent breast screening if they were found to be at higher risk, but fewer (58.8%) were willing to have less frequent screening if at lower risk (t (956)=15.6, p<0.001). Ethnic minority status was associated with less acceptability of more frequent screening (OR=0.40, 95% CI=0.21-0.74), but there were no other significant demographic correlates. Higher perceived risk of BC was associated with greater acceptability of more frequent screening (OR=1.71, 95%CI=1.27-2.30). Conclusion: Women were positive about adjusting the frequency of mammography screening in line with personal genetic risk, but it will be important to develop effective communication materials to minimise resistance to reducing screening frequency for those at lower genetic risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Breast cancer", "Population survey", "Stratified screening", "Women's attitude"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Breast Neoplasms", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Female", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Logistic Models", "Mammography", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937640366", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"]], "AuthorData": {"51565577500": {"Name": "Meisel S.F.", "AuthorID": "51565577500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Health Behaviour Research Centre, Dept.
