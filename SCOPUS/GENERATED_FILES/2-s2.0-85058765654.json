Here, we confirm these results and provide the mathematical justifications. We point out that the distinction between population and species splits made in the protracted speciation model (PSM) has no influence on the generation of gene trees and sequence data, which explains why no method can use such data to distinguish between population splits and speciation. We suggest that the PSM is unrealistic as its mechanism for assigning species status assumes instantaneous speciation, contradicting prevailing taxonomic practice. We confirm the suggestion, based on simulation, that in the case of speciation with gene flow, Bayesian model selection as implemented in bpp tends to detect population splits when the amount of data (the number of loci) increases. We discuss the use of a recently proposed empirical genealogical divergence index (gdi) for species delimitation and illustrate that parameter estimates produced by a full likelihood analysis as implemented in bpp provide much more reliable inference under the gdi than the approximate method phrapl. We distinguish between Bayesian model selection and parameter estimation and suggest that the model selection approach is useful for identifying sympatric cryptic species, while the parameter estimation approach may be used to implement empirical criteria for determining species status among allopatric populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bpp", "multispecies coalescent", "Species delimitation", "taxonomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Bayes Theorem", "Classification", "Computer Simulation", "Genetic Speciation", "Models, Biological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058765654", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"6603176284": {"Name": "Leach\u00e9 A.", "AuthorID": "6603176284", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology and Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, University of Washington"}, "37023656200": {"Name": "Zhu T.", "AuthorID": "37023656200", "AffiliationID": "60003707, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Random Complex Structures and Data Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8148132700": {"Name": "Yang Z.", "AuthorID": "8148132700", "AffiliationID": "60018380, 60009982", "AffiliationName": "Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Studies, Harvard University"}, "57204367074": {"Name": "Rannala B.", "AuthorID": "57204367074", "AffiliationID": "60014439", "AffiliationName": "Department of Evolution and Ecology, University of California Davis"}}}
