However, in a number of patients, symptoms persist or may even worsen over time, suggesting the development of concomitant Parkinson's disease. The prevalence estimates of Parkinson's disease after neuroleptic exposure are unexpectedly high, suggesting a causal relationship. We critically review available literature in this regard, and some pathophysiological hypotheses that might explain such a relationship are suggested. Some patients may have an undetermined genetic susceptibility to parkinsonism. We speculate that the possible neurotoxic effect of neuroleptics exerted on a susceptible dopaminergic system would lead over the long-term to a self-fostering, progressive process. Knowledge gaps and future perspectives are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anti-pychotics", "Drug-induced parkinsonism", "Neuroleptics", "Parkinson's disease", "Pathophysiology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antipsychotic Agents", "Brain", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Parkinson Disease", "Parkinson Disease, Secondary", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929654369", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36008087300": {"Name": "Erro R.", "AuthorID": "36008087300", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Neurologiche e del Movimento, Universit\u00e0 di Verona"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.P.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60109771", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology"}, "7003968661": {"Name": "Tinazzi M.", "AuthorID": "7003968661", "AffiliationID": "60032256", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Neurologiche e del Movimento, Universit\u00e0 di Verona"}}}
