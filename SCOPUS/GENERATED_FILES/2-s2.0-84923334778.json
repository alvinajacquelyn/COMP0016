Despite surgery, up to 50% of patients relapse with incurable disease. First-line chemotherapy uses the topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) poison irinotecan, which triggers cell death by trapping TOP1 on DNA. The removal of TOP1 peptide from TOP1-DNA breaks is conducted by tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1). Despite putative roles for TDP1 and TOP1 in colorectal cancer, their role in cellular and clinical responses to TOP1-targeting therapies remains unclear. Here, we show varying expression levels of TOP1 and TDP1 polypeptides in multiple colorectal cancer cell lines and in clinical colorectal cancer samples. TDP1 overexpression or TOP1 depletion is protective. Conversely, TDP1 depletion increases DNA-strand breakage and hypersensitivity to irinotecan in a TOP1-dependent manner, presenting a potential therapeutic opportunity in colorectal cancer. TDP1 protein levels correlate well with mRNA and with TDP1 catalytic activity. However, no correlation is observed between inherent TDP1 or TOP1 levels alone and irinotecan sensitivity, pointing at their limited utility as predictive biomarkers in colorectal cancer. These findings establish TDP1 as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer and question the validity of TOP1 or TDP1 on their own as predictive biomarkers for irinotecan response.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biocatalysis", "Camptothecin", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "DNA Topoisomerases, Type I", "Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic", "Humans", "Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases", "RNA, Messenger"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923334778", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"52264201900": {"Name": "Meisenberg C.", "AuthorID": "52264201900", "AffiliationID": "60009097, 60017317, 60022106", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust DNA Repair Group, Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex"}, "8257352000": {"Name": "El-Khamisy S.F.", "AuthorID": "8257352000", "AffiliationID": "60104893", "AffiliationName": "Center of Genomics, Helmy Institute, Zewail City of Science and Technology"}, "14014363300": {"Name": "Gilbert D.C.", "AuthorID": "14014363300", "AffiliationID": "60012806", "AffiliationName": "Sussex Cancer Centre, Royal Sussex County Hospital"}, "18436086100": {"Name": "Chalmers A.", "AuthorID": "18436086100", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow"}, "56526964900": {"Name": "Haley V.", "AuthorID": "56526964900", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Science, Department of Life, Health and Chemical Sciences"}, "6602512786": {"Name": "Gollins S.", "AuthorID": "6602512786", "AffiliationID": "60010389", "AffiliationName": "North Wales Cancer Treatment Centre, Betsi Cadwaladr University of Health Board, Ysbty Glan Clwyd"}, "55616973200": {"Name": "Ward S.E.", "AuthorID": "55616973200", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Translational Drug Discovery Group, School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex"}}}
