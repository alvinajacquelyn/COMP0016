Each film contains only diegetic sounds and consists of fixed shots of architectural spaces and objects closely associated with the most recent Argentine military dictatorship (1976\u20131983) and recent attempts to memorialise the atrocities they committed. Through the close analysis of Perel\u2019s first two films \u2013 El predio (2010) and Los murales (2011) \u2013 this article focusses on Perel\u2019s highly distinctive use of environmental sound and argues that they are, in fact, uniquely musical works. Drawing on the work of John Cage, Michel Chion, Deleuze and Guattari, and Doreen Massey, the article proposes that Perel manipulates sound in order to situate debates over the memorialisation of recent atrocities in a perpetual present and thus critique contemporary abuses of power in Argentina.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argentina", "Jonathan Perel", "memorialisation", "memory and politics", "military dictatorship", "sound in cinema"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052561612", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"]], "AuthorData": {"56030423700": {"Name": "Geraghty N.H.D.", "AuthorID": "56030423700", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "University of London"}}}
