Prototypes were created by averaging photographs of individuals from 6 different age and sex categories (male 5-8 years, male 9-12 years, female 5-8 years, female 9-12 years, adult male and adult female), each posing 6 basic emotional expressions. In the study 5-8 year old children (n = 33), 9-13 year old children (n = 70) and adults (n = 92) labelled these expression prototypes in a 6- alternative forced-choice task. There was no evidence that children or adults recognised expressions better on faces from their own age group. Instead, child facial expression prototypes were recognised as accurately as adult expression prototypes by all age groups. This suggests there is no substantial own-age advantage in children's emotion recognition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Emotions", "Facial Expression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929376454", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56644083700": {"Name": "Griffiths S.", "AuthorID": "56644083700", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60172455", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Integrative Epidemiology Unit (MRC IEU), University of Bristol"}, "6603926425": {"Name": "Penton-Voak I.S.", "AuthorID": "6603926425", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Experimental Psychology, University of Bristol"}, "7003805022": {"Name": "Jarrold C.", "AuthorID": "7003805022", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Experimental Psychology, University of Bristol"}, "7004859481": {"Name": "Munaf\u00f2 M.R.", "AuthorID": "7004859481", "AffiliationID": "60020650, 60115380", "AffiliationName": "UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, University of Bristol"}}}
