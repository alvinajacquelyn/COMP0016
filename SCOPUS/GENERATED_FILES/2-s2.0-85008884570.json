Objectives We sought to assess associations between 25(OH)D levels in cord blood or maternal venous blood and risk of offspring's asthma, wheeze, and respiratory tract infections. Methods Data were derived from PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, references from relevant articles, and de novo results from published studies until December 2015. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted among 16 birth cohort studies. Results Comparing the highest with the lowest category of 25(OH)D levels, the pooled odds ratios were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.70-1.01; P = .064) for asthma, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.58-1.03; P = .083) for wheeze, and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.66-1.09; P = .187) for respiratory tract infections. The observed inverse association for wheeze was more pronounced and became statistically significant in the studies that measured 25(OH)D levels in cord blood (0.43; 95% CI, 0.29-0.62; P < .001). Conclusions Accumulated evidence generated from this meta-analysis suggests that increased in utero exposure to 25(OH)D is inversely associated with the risk of asthma and wheeze during childhood. These findings are in keeping with the results of 2 recently published randomized clinical trials of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["25(OH)D", "asthma", "birth cohort studies", "meta-analysis", "respiratory tract infections", "wheeze"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asthma", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Dietary Supplements", "Female", "Fetal Blood", "Humans", "Male", "Maternal-Fetal Exchange", "Odds Ratio", "Pregnancy", "Respiratory Sounds", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Risk", "Vitamin D"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008884570", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"56985043900": {"Name": "Feng H.", "AuthorID": "56985043900", "AffiliationID": "60025084, 60087536", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Nutrition, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "35270676700": {"Name": "Wan Y.", "AuthorID": "35270676700", "AffiliationID": "60025084, 60087536", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Nutrition, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University"}, "7401711278": {"Name": "Cai W.", "AuthorID": "7401711278", "AffiliationID": "112689275", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Key Laboratory of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, the Shanghai Institute of Pediatric Research"}, "16310937900": {"Name": "Xun P.", "AuthorID": "16310937900", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health-Bloomington, Indiana University"}, "7202010636": {"Name": "He K.", "AuthorID": "7202010636", "AffiliationID": "60021121", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health-Bloomington, Indiana University"}, "54903918000": {"Name": "Pike K.", "AuthorID": "54903918000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "26323396400": {"Name": "Wills A.K.", "AuthorID": "26323396400", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Clinical Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "35331635400": {"Name": "Chawes B.L.", "AuthorID": "35331635400", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60014959", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC), Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}, "7103027634": {"Name": "Bisgaard H.", "AuthorID": "7103027634", "AffiliationID": "60030840, 60014959", "AffiliationName": "Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC), Herlev and Gentofte Hospital, University of Copenhagen"}}}
