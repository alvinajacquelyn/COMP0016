Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.Hybrid halide perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) exhibit unusually low free-carrier concentrations despite being processed at low-temperatures from solution. We demonstrate, through quantum mechanical calculations, that an origin of this phenomenon is a prevalence of ionic over electronic disorder in stoichiometric materials. Schottky defect formation provides a mechanism to selfregulate the concentration of charge carriers through ionic compensation of charged point defects. The equilibrium charged vacancy concentration is predicted to exceed 0.4% at room temperature. This behavior, which goes against established defect conventions for inorganic semiconductors, has implications for photovoltaic performance.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Hybrid perovskites", "Ionic compensation", "Schottky defects"], "IndexKeywords": ["Free carrier concentration", "Inorganic semiconductors", "Ionic compensation", "Photovoltaic performance", "Quantum-mechanical calculation", "Schottky defects", "Self-regulation mechanisms", "Vacancy concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028163873", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"35315151400": {"Name": "Walsh A.", "AuthorID": "35315151400", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies And, Department of Chemistry, University of Bath Claverton Down"}, "16647397400": {"Name": "Scanlon D.", "AuthorID": "16647397400", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd., Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "15821863700": {"Name": "Chen S.", "AuthorID": "15821863700", "AffiliationID": "60021200", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Polar Materials and Devices (MOE), East China Normal University"}, "13003856200": {"Name": "Gong X.", "AuthorID": "13003856200", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Computational Physical Sciences (MOE) And, Surface Physics Laboratory, Fudan University"}, "7401765072": {"Name": "Wei S.", "AuthorID": "7401765072", "AffiliationID": "60030451", "AffiliationName": "National Renewable Energy Laboratory"}}}
