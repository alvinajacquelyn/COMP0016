Here we introduce and evaluate methods to find low-dimensional (2D or 3D) descriptors of these high-dimensional representations, which are amenable for visualization. Once low-dimensional descriptors are found, it is useful to identify structure in them. We evaluate clustering algorithms to automatically identify this structure. In addition, typical recordings of epileptic activity are long, extending for several days or weeks. We present and assess extensions of the previous methods to handle large datasets.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Descriptors", "High-dimensional", "Large datasets", "Long-term recording", "Low dimensional", "Low dimensional structure", "Seizure prediction", "Algorithms", "Cluster Analysis", "Electroencephalography", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Seizures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85077846313", "SubjectAreas": [["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"56255359900": {"Name": "Rapela J.", "AuthorID": "56255359900", "AffiliationID": "60011460", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and Carney Institute for Brain Science, Brown University"}, "55916693000": {"Name": "Proix T.", "AuthorID": "55916693000", "AffiliationID": "60023695", "AffiliationName": "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Center for Neurorestoration and Neurotechonology"}, "55183725500": {"Name": "Todorov D.", "AuthorID": "55183725500", "AffiliationID": "60011460", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience and Carney Institute for Brain Science, Brown University"}, "6602193196": {"Name": "Truccolo W.", "AuthorID": "6602193196", "AffiliationID": "60023695", "AffiliationName": "U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Center for Neurorestoration and Neurotechonology"}}}
