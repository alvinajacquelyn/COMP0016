UCL established its Certificate and Diploma courses at a time when town planning was in its infancy as an academic discipline and field of professional activity. There were no precedents to follow \u2013 it was not until 1916 that the Town Planning Institute formulated its first syllabus. Adshead's initial course structure and curriculum remained largely unchanged until the decision was taken in 1971 to phase out the part-time planning courses. Subsequent changes reflected the personal planning philosophies of his successors, the recommendations of the Schuster Committee of 1950, the post-war transformation of statutory planning in the UK, and the changing requirements of professional accreditation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Patrick Abercrombie", "planning education", "Stanley Adshead", "UCL", "William Holford"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959932400", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"7404083683": {"Name": "Collins M.P.", "AuthorID": "7404083683", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Centre Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL Faculty of the Built Environment"}}}
