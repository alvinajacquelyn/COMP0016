This study compared the longitudinal predictors of language skills in children with Down syndrome with those in typically developing control children matched for initial level of nonverbal mental ability. An age cohort of children with Down syndrome (. n=. 43) and 57 typically developing control children was assessed on measures of vocabulary, grammar, and verbal short-term memory three times at yearly intervals. Children with Down syndrome showed slower development on all measures than the typically developing controls. Longitudinal analyses showed moderate to high stability of language and verbal short-term memory skills. Our results confirm earlier evidence of pervasive language learning difficulties in this group and suggest that early language intervention should be given high priority.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Down syndrome", "Grammar", "Language", "Longitudinal relationship", "Verbal short-term memory", "Vocabulary"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aptitude", "Child", "Child Development", "Child, Preschool", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Language", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925431336", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"38362140200": {"Name": "N\u00e6ss K.", "AuthorID": "38362140200", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Special Needs Education, University of Oslo"}, "9841225400": {"Name": "Lyster S.", "AuthorID": "9841225400", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Special Needs Education, University of Oslo"}, "7006105965": {"Name": "Hulme C.", "AuthorID": "7006105965", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University College London"}, "57203596451": {"Name": "Lerv\u00e5g A.", "AuthorID": "57203596451", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, University of Oslo"}}}
