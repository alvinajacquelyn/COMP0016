Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis within a cluster-randomized factorial study in 69 care homes with 549 residents was conducted. Each cluster was randomized to receive either the Well-being and Health for people with Dementia (WHELD) intervention or TAU for nine months. Health and social care costs, agitation, and quality of life outcomes were evaluated. Results: Improvements in agitation and quality of life were evident in residents allocated to the WHELD intervention group. The additional cost of the WHELD intervention was offset by the higher health and social care costs incurred by TAU group residents (mean difference, \u00a32103; 95% confidence interval, \u221213 to 4219). Discussion: The WHELD intervention has clinical and economic benefits when used in residents with clinically significant agitation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agitation", "Alzheimer", "Care home", "Costs", "Dementia", "Fees", "Nursing home"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged, 80 and over", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Nursing Homes", "Psychomotor Agitation", "Quality of Life"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060408356", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56281591300": {"Name": "Romeo R.", "AuthorID": "56281591300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Research Department, King's College London, institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "55761733200": {"Name": "Zala D.", "AuthorID": "55761733200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Health Service and Population Research Department, King's College London, institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience"}, "7202388606": {"Name": "Knapp M.", "AuthorID": "7202388606", "AffiliationID": "60003059", "AffiliationName": "Personal Social Services Research Unit, London School of Economics and Political Science"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, University of Nottingham, Innovation Park"}, "7004743570": {"Name": "Fossey J.", "AuthorID": "7004743570", "AffiliationID": "60116889", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Services, Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust, Fulbrook Centre"}, "35351371500": {"Name": "Ballard C.", "AuthorID": "35351371500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age Related Diseases, King's College London, Guy's Campus"}}}
