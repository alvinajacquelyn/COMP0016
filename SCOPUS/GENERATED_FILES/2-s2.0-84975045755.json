In this paper, we reconstruct the migratory behavior of red deer (Cervus elaphus) and caprids at the Pleistocene-Holocene transition in the northeastern Adriatic region using stable oxygen isotope analysis of tooth enamel. The data show a significant change in \u03b418O values from the Pleistocene into the Holocene, as well as isotopic variation between taxa, the case study sites, and through time. We then discuss the implications of seasonal faunal availability as determining factors in human mobility patterns.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Migration", "Animals", "Deer", "Dental Enamel", "Feeding Behavior", "Fossils", "History, Ancient", "Human Migration", "Humans", "Mammals", "Oxygen Isotopes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975045755", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"56942460500": {"Name": "Pilaar Birch S.", "AuthorID": "56942460500", "AffiliationID": "60029747", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology, Department of Geography, University of Georgia"}, "8885138300": {"Name": "Miracle P.", "AuthorID": "8885138300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge"}, "7102366592": {"Name": "O'Connell T.", "AuthorID": "7102366592", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge"}, "8747066900": {"Name": "Stevens R.", "AuthorID": "8747066900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}}}
