Risk-benefit assessment is commonly advocated as a way of allowing children to take managed risks within settings. However \u2018risk-benefit\u2019 adopts a limited strategy of convincing professionals of the developmental benefits of risk, disregarding other factors which may also influence professionals when making risk assessments in their settings. This paper proposes an alternative approach to supporting practitioners in allowing risk by exploring the complexity of these influencing factors. A narrative literature review identifies five inter-related factors which affect professionals\u2019 attitudes to risk. The relationships between these factors are discussed and presented as a model which illustrates the complexity faced by practitioners when carrying out risk assessments. The authors argue that children\u2019s opportunities to benefit from risk in play may increase if these influencing factors could be explored within professional development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bronfenbrenner\u2019s model", "early childhood", "narrative review", "playwork practice", "professional practice", "Risky play"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978522766", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Pediatrics", "NURS", "2919"]], "AuthorData": {"57190228397": {"Name": "van Rooijen M.", "AuthorID": "57190228397", "AffiliationID": "60070734", "AffiliationName": "Department of Research Methodology and Theory of Sciences, University of Humanistic Studies"}, "57190230097": {"Name": "Newstead S.", "AuthorID": "57190230097", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
