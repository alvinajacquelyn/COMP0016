These systems can be activated by perceptual processing and carry over to subsequent conceptual processing, in particular to analytical and creative thought. A conceptual and a high-powered close replication of previously reported studies test predictions of GLOMOsys for analytical thought and for analytical and creative thought, respectively. The present studies found no evidence that processing style primed via the Navon letter task has an impact on creative or analytic thought.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Attention", "Creativity", "Female", "Field Dependence-Independence", "Humans", "Male", "Reproducibility of Results", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949058131", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"7006445400": {"Name": "Klauer K.", "AuthorID": "7006445400", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Institut F\u00fcr Psychologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t Freiburg"}, "46161708800": {"Name": "Singmann H.", "AuthorID": "46161708800", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Psychologisches Institut, Universit\u00e4t Z\u00fcrich"}}}
