This study aimed to investigate the role of SPECT/CT following 2-D planar lymphoscintigraphy (dynamic and static) in the detection and localization of sentinel lymph nodes in the groin. Methods: A qualitative (visual) review was performed on planar followed by SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy in 115 consecutive patients (age 28\u201386 years) who underwent injection of 99mTc-nanocolloid followed by immediate acquisition of dynamic (20 min) and early static scans (5 min) initially and further delayed static (5 min) images at 120 min followed by SPECT/CT imaging. The lymph nodes detected in each groin on planar lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT were compared. Results: A total of 440 and 467 nodes were identified on planar scintigraphy and SPECT/CT, respectively. Overall, SPECT/CT confirmed the findings of planar imaging in 28/115 cases (24%). In the remaining 87 cases (76%), gross discrepancies were observed between planar and SPECT/CT images. SPECT/CT identified 17 instances of skin contamination (16 patients, 13%) and 36 instances of in-transit lymphatic tract activity (24 patients, 20%) that had been interpreted as tracer-avid lymph nodes on planar imaging. In addition, SPECT/CT identified 53 tracer-avid nodes in 48 patients (42%) that were not visualized on planar imaging and led to reclassification of the drainage basins (pelvic/inguinal) of 27 tracer-avid nodes. Conclusions: The addition of SPECT/CT improved the rate of detection of true tracer-avid lymph nodes and delineated their precise (3-D) anatomic localization in drainage basins.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer of the penis", "Drainage basin", "Planar lymphoscintigraphy", "Sentinel node", "SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Penile Neoplasms", "Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy", "Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Computed Tomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011874489", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"54399175900": {"Name": "Saad Z.Z.", "AuthorID": "54399175900", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, 5th Floor, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35311408700": {"Name": "Michopoulou S.", "AuthorID": "35311408700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University College Hospitals London"}, "8912484500": {"Name": "Gacinovic S.", "AuthorID": "8912484500", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, University College Hospitals London"}, "7005791371": {"Name": "Bomanji J.", "AuthorID": "7005791371", "AffiliationID": "60024544, 60090043", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Nuclear Medicine, 5th Floor, UCLH NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57189423601": {"Name": "Omorphos S.", "AuthorID": "57189423601", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospitals London"}, "7102425101": {"Name": "Malone P.", "AuthorID": "7102425101", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospitals London"}, "26667018400": {"Name": "Nigam R.", "AuthorID": "26667018400", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospitals London"}, "24339107700": {"Name": "Muneer A.", "AuthorID": "24339107700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospitals London"}}}
