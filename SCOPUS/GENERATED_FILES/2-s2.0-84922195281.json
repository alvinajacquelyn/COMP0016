The gallium arsenide films were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy. Powder XRD showed that cubic polycrystalline GaAs had been deposited with films grown at the higher temperatures having a Ga to As ratio of 1:1. EDX mapping, XPS depth profiling and SIMS showed that the films contained low levels of contaminants. The method described shows the formation of GaAs films with increasing crystallinity and stoichiometry reaching unity with increasing deposition temperature.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aerosol-assisted chemical vapour depositions", "Deposition temperatures", "EDX-mapping", "Energy dispersive x-ray", "GaAs thin films", "Glass substrates", "Polycrystalline", "XPS depth profiling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922195281", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"37081732100": {"Name": "Sathasivam S.", "AuthorID": "37081732100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7005826606": {"Name": "Blackman C.S.", "AuthorID": "7005826606", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003437916": {"Name": "Carmalt C.J.", "AuthorID": "7003437916", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Research Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "9839704400": {"Name": "Arnepalli R.R.", "AuthorID": "9839704400", "AffiliationID": "60012222", "AffiliationName": "Applied Materials Inc."}, "56323894100": {"Name": "Singh K.K.", "AuthorID": "56323894100", "AffiliationID": "60012222", "AffiliationName": "Applied Materials Inc."}, "7103351361": {"Name": "Visser R.J.", "AuthorID": "7103351361", "AffiliationID": "60012222", "AffiliationName": "Applied Materials Inc."}}}
