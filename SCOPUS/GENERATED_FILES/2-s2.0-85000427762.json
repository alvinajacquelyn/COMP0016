Here we investigate the electrical double-layer (EDL) structure and the capacitance of two RTILs, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI-BF4), and their mixtures with onion-like carbon electrodes using experiment and classical density functional theory. The principal difference between these ionic liquids is the smaller diameter of the BF4 - anion relative to the TFSI- anion and the EMI+ cation. A volcano-shaped trend is identified for the capacitance versus the composition of the RTIL mixture. The mixture effect, which makes more counterions pack on and more co-ions leave from the electrode surface, leads to an increase of the counterion density within the EDL and thus a larger capacitance. These theoretical predictions are in good agreement with our experimental observations and offer guidance for designing RTIL mixtures for EDL supercapacitors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate", "Capacitive performance", "Counterion density", "Electrical double layers", "Electrochemical capacitor", "Electrode surfaces", "Ionic liquid mixtures", "Room temperature ionic liquids"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000427762", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"55571313700": {"Name": "Lian C.", "AuthorID": "55571313700", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "57191828671": {"Name": "Liu K.", "AuthorID": "57191828671", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}, "57203272553": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57203272553", "AffiliationID": "60029526", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering, University of California"}, "34570619200": {"Name": "Liu H.", "AuthorID": "34570619200", "AffiliationID": "60011069, 60117934", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Chemical Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology"}, "36728378600": {"Name": "Van Aken K.", "AuthorID": "36728378600", "AffiliationID": "60014662", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Engineering and A.J.
