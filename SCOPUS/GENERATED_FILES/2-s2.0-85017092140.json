During early stages of migration, these cells are present in two well-defined streams within the developing cortex. In an attempt to identify candidate genes which may play a role in interneuron stream specification, we previously carried out a microarray analysis which identified a number of cadherin receptors that were differentially expressed in these streams, including Cadherin-13 (Cdh13). Expression analysis confirmed Cdh13 to be present in the preplate layer at E13.5 and, later in development, in some cortical interneurons and pyramidal cells. Analysis of Cdh13 knockout mice at E18.5, but not at E15.5, showed a reduction in the number of interneurons and late born pyramidal neurons and a concomitant increase in apoptotic cells in the cortex. These observations were confirmed in dissociated cell cultures using overexpression and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) constructs and dominant negative inhibitory proteins. Our findings identified a novel protective role for Cdh13 in cortical neuron development.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Cadherin", "Cell migration", "Interneurons"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Cadherins", "Cell Count", "Cell Movement", "Cell Proliferation", "Cells, Cultured", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Interneurons", "Male", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Knockout", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017092140", "SubjectAreas": [["Anatomy", "MEDI", "2702"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"57193858318": {"Name": "Killen A.C.", "AuthorID": "57193858318", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7202252013": {"Name": "Barber M.", "AuthorID": "7202252013", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "7006265542": {"Name": "Parnavelas J.G.", "AuthorID": "7006265542", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "35197934600": {"Name": "Andrews W.D.", "AuthorID": "35197934600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "57095632900": {"Name": "Paulin J.J.W.", "AuthorID": "57095632900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7003944501": {"Name": "Ranscht B.", "AuthorID": "7003944501", "AffiliationID": "60023242", "AffiliationName": "Sanford-Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute"}}}
