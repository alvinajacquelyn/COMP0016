Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (Pan paniscus) are the closest living relatives of humans, but the two species show distinct behavioral and physiological differences, particularly regarding female reproduction. Despite their recent rapid decline, the demographic histories of the two species have been different during the past 1-2 Myr, likely having an impact on their genomic diversity. Here, we analyze the inferred functional consequences of genetic variation across 69 individuals,making use of themost complete data set of genomes in the Pan clade to date.We test towhich extent the demographic history influences the efficacy of purifying selection in these species.We find that small historical effective population sizes (Ne) correlate not only with low levels of genetic diversity but also with a larger number of deleterious alleles in homozygosity and an increased proportion of deleterious changes at lowfrequencies. Toinvestigate the putativegeneticbasis forphenotypic differencesbetweenchimpanzees andbonobos, we exploit the catalog of putatively deleterious protein-coding changes in each lineage.We show that bonobo-specific nonsynonymous changes are enrichedin genes relatedtoage atmenarche inhumans, suggesting that the prominent physiologicaldifferences in the female reproductive systembetweenchimpanzees andbonobosmightbe explained, inpart,byputatively adaptive changeson the bonobo lineage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["bonobo genome", "bonobo reproduction", "comparative genomics", "deleteriousness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Genetic Variation", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Pan paniscus", "Pan troglodytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065163677", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"57205447070": {"Name": "Han S.", "AuthorID": "57205447070", "AffiliationID": "60032942, 60006754, 60103738", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Biologia Evolutiva, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientrificas, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "11140868400": {"Name": "Marques-Bonet T.", "AuthorID": "11140868400", "AffiliationID": "60023020, 60102747", "AffiliationName": "Institut Catal\u00e0 de Paleontologia Miquel Crusafont, Universitat Aut\u00f2noma de Barcelona, Edifici ICTA-ICP"}, "55966312700": {"Name": "Kuhlwilm M.", "AuthorID": "55966312700", "AffiliationID": "60032942, 60006754, 60103738", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Biologia Evolutiva, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientrificas, Universitat Pompeu Fabra"}, "57209451622": {"Name": "Andre A.", "AuthorID": "57209451622", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, UCL Genetics Institute, University College London"}}}
