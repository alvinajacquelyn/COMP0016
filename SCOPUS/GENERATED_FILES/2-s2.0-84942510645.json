All rights reserved.Objectives: To assess the impact of exposure to single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) on virological response in young Ugandan/Zimbabwean children (<3 years) initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART), and to investigate other predictors of response. Design: Observational analysis within the ARROW randomized trial. Methods: sdNVP exposure was ascertained by the caregiver's self-report when the child initiated non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART. Viral load was assayed retrospectively over a median 4.1 years of follow-up. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify independent predictors of viral load below 80 copies/ml, 48 and 144 weeks afterART initiation (backwards elimination, exit P=0.1). Results: Median (IQR) age at ART initiation was 17 (10-23) months in 78 sdNVPexposed children vs. 21 (14-27) months in 289 non-exposed children (36 vs. 20% <12 months). At week 48, 49 of 73 (67%) sdNVP-exposed and 154 of 272 (57%) nonexposed children had viral load below 80 copies/ml [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.34 (1.26-4.34), P=0.007]; 79 and 77% had viral load below 400 copies/ml. Suppression was significantly lower in males (P=0.009), those with higher pre-ART viral load (P=0.001), taking syrups (P=0.05) and with lower self-reported adherence (P=0.04). At week 144, 55 of 73 (75%) exposed and 188 of 272 (69%) non-exposed children had less than 80 copies/ml [aOR 1.75 (0.93-3.29), P=0.08]. There was no difference between children with and without previous sdNVP exposure in intermediate/highlevel resistance to NRTIs (P>0.3) or NNRTIs (P>0.1) (n=88) at week 144. Conclusion: Given the limited global availability of lopinavir/ritonavir, its significant formulation challenges in young children, and the significant paediatric treatment gap, tablet fixed-dose-combination NVP-based ART remains a good alternative to syrup lopinavir-based ART for children, particularly those over 1 year and even if exposed to sdNVP.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Africa", "Antiretroviral therapy", "Children", "HIV", "Single-dose nevirapine", "Viral load"], "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Retroviral Agents", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Nevirapine", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome", "Uganda", "Viral Load", "Zimbabwe"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942510645", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"6602744314": {"Name": "Musoke P.", "AuthorID": "6602744314", "AffiliationID": "60196602", "AffiliationName": "Makerere University College of Health Sciences"}, "17135681200": {"Name": "Musiime V.", "AuthorID": "17135681200", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "24777020100": {"Name": "Szubert A.J.", "AuthorID": "24777020100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "12766874200": {"Name": "Spyer M.", "AuthorID": "12766874200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "35402208300": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "35402208300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "35495600000": {"Name": "Gibb D.M.", "AuthorID": "35495600000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London, UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "56875010200": {"Name": "Williams D.E.", "AuthorID": "56875010200", "AffiliationID": "60071691", "AffiliationName": "Joint Clinical Research Centre"}, "57210663714": {"Name": "Nathoo K.", "AuthorID": "57210663714", "AffiliationID": "60033774", "AffiliationName": "University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences"}, "55905224100": {"Name": "Nahirya-Ntege P.", "AuthorID": "55905224100", "AffiliationID": "60071671", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council, Uganda Virus Research Institute Uganda Research Unit on AIDS"}, "6507562750": {"Name": "Mutasa K.", "AuthorID": "6507562750", "AffiliationID": "113913855", "AffiliationName": "Zvitambo Institute for Maternal and Child Health Research"}, "15760719100": {"Name": "Prendergast A.J.", "AuthorID": "15760719100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "Queen Mary University of London"}}}
