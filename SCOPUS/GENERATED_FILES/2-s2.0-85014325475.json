In 2014, 6000 critically ill or injured children were transferred between hospitals in the UK. While most of the transfers are done by specialist teams, as many as 23% are done by non-specialist teams. These patients are some of the sickest children. It is while in transit that these patients are most at risk, and the transferring team is most exposed. To achieve a smooth and safe transfer it is important that the appropriate team with the relevant skills undertakes such transfers. The patient's condition should be optimised before transfer and any likely difficulties are anticipated, and that the transferring team is prepared to act to resolve any complications swiftly and effectively. In this review we will attempt to offer our approach to the safe transfer of the critically ill child.", "AuthorKeywords": ["critical illness", "critical injury", "inter-hospital transport", "paediatric intensive care", "stabilization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014325475", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"8268116400": {"Name": "Sarfatti A.", "AuthorID": "8268116400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Children's Acute Transport Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602350620": {"Name": "Ramnarayan P.", "AuthorID": "6602350620", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Children's Acute Transport Service, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
