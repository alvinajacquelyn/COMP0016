This study concerns the potential risk of contaminating these aquifers in areas surrounding the city of Dhaka where hydraulic heads in aquifers >150 m deep have dropped by 70 m in a few decades due to municipal pumping. Water levels measured continuously from 2012 to 2014 in 12 deep (>150 m), 3 intermediate (90-150 m) and 6 shallow (<90 m) community wells, 1 shallow private well, and 1 river piezometer show that the resulting drawdown cone extends 15-35 km east of Dhaka. Water levels in 4 low-As community wells within the 62-147 m depth range closest to Dhaka were inaccessible by suction for up to a third of the year. Lateral hydraulic gradients in the deep aquifer system ranged from 1.7 \u00d7 10-4 to 3.7 \u00d7 10-4 indicating flow towards Dhaka throughout 2012-2014. Vertical recharge on the edge of the drawdown cone was estimated at 0.21 \u00b1 0.06 m/yr. The data suggest that continued municipal pumping in Dhaka could eventually contaminate some relatively shallow community wells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arsenic", "Asia", "Deep aquifer", "Delta", "Regional hydrogeology", "Urban groundwater pumping"], "IndexKeywords": ["Asia", "Community wells", "Deep aquifer systems", "Delta", "Hydraulic gradients", "Regional hydrogeology", "Rural Bangladesh", "Urban groundwater"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974651717", "SubjectAreas": [["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"]], "AuthorData": {"26434785300": {"Name": "Knappett P.", "AuthorID": "26434785300", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology and Geophysics, Texas AandM University"}, "6701786475": {"Name": "Steckler M.", "AuthorID": "6701786475", "AffiliationID": "60033011", "AffiliationName": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University"}, "6701443869": {"Name": "Bostick B.", "AuthorID": "6701443869", "AffiliationID": "60033011", "AffiliationName": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University"}, "14040562700": {"Name": "Mihajlov I.", "AuthorID": "14040562700", "AffiliationID": "60033011", "AffiliationName": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University"}, "57189691152": {"Name": "Mozumder R.", "AuthorID": "57189691152", "AffiliationID": "60033011", "AffiliationName": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University"}, "7003938156": {"Name": "van Geen A.", "AuthorID": "7003938156", "AffiliationID": "60033011", "AffiliationName": "Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University"}, "56906300900": {"Name": "Shuai P.", "AuthorID": "56906300900", "AffiliationID": "60020547", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology and Geophysics, Texas AandM University"}, "6603163699": {"Name": "Mailloux B.", "AuthorID": "6603163699", "AffiliationID": "60009906", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Science, Barnard College"}, "54406606100": {"Name": "Choudhury I.", "AuthorID": "54406606100", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Dhaka"}, "57212744181": {"Name": "Akhter S.", "AuthorID": "57212744181", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Dhaka"}, "56243347100": {"Name": "Ahmed K.", "AuthorID": "56243347100", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, University of Dhaka"}, "56054916400": {"Name": "Khan M.", "AuthorID": "56054916400", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geological Sciences, University of Delaware"}, "8697727500": {"Name": "Michael H.", "AuthorID": "8697727500", "AffiliationID": "60023004", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Delaware"}, "37046714200": {"Name": "Barua S.", "AuthorID": "37046714200", "AffiliationID": "60000689", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geology, Kansas State University"}, "55812138600": {"Name": "Mondal D.", "AuthorID": "55812138600", "AffiliationID": "60003937, 60007033", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Queens College, City University of New York"}, "7202113812": {"Name": "Harvey C.", "AuthorID": "7202113812", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "22956412500": {"Name": "Shamsudduha M.", "AuthorID": "22956412500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}}}
