Although a number of such measures have been proposed, there is only limited guidance regarding their use in the context of model validation. This paper reviewed and evaluated a wide range of performance measures to provide some guidelines for their use in practice. Methods: An extensive simulation study based on two clinical datasets was conducted to investigate the performance of the measures in external validation settings. Measures were selected from categories that assess the overall performance, discrimination and calibration of a survival prediction model. Some of these have been modified to allow their use with validation data, and a case study is provided to describe how these measures can be estimated in practice. The measures were evaluated with respect to their robustness to censoring and ease of interpretation. All measures are implemented, or are straightforward to implement, in statistical software. Results: Most of the performance measures were reasonably robust to moderate levels of censoring. One exception was Harrell's concordance measure which tended to increase as censoring increased. Conclusions: We recommend that Uno's concordance measure is used to quantify concordance when there are moderate levels of censoring. Alternatively, G\u00f6nen and Heller's measure could be considered, especially if censoring is very high, but we suggest that the prediction model is re-calibrated first. We also recommend that Royston's D is routinely reported to assess discrimination since it has an appealing interpretation. The calibration slope is useful for both internal and external validation settings and recommended to report routinely. Our recommendation would be to use any of the predictive accuracy measures and provide the corresponding predictive accuracy curves. In addition, we recommend to investigate the characteristics of the validation data such as the level of censoring and the distribution of the prognostic index derived in the validation setting before choosing the performance measures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["calibration", "discrimination", "Prognostic model", "Survival analysis", "Validation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Breast Neoplasms", "Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic", "Computer Simulation", "Datasets as Topic", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Models, Statistical", "Survival Analysis", "Validation Studies as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018523812", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"57210974579": {"Name": "Rahman M.", "AuthorID": "57210974579", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Statistical Research and Training, University of Dhaka"}, "7003730066": {"Name": "Ambler G.", "AuthorID": "7003730066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7005718930": {"Name": "Omar R.", "AuthorID": "7005718930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "23491409100": {"Name": "Choodari-Oskooei B.", "AuthorID": "23491409100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology, University College London"}}}
