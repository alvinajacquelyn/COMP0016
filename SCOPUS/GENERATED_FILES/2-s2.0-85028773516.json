We show that there is a positive raw association between the level of school disadvantage and the turnover rate of its teachers. This association diminishes as we control for school, pupil and local teacher labour market characteristics, but is not eliminated. The remaining association is largely accounted for by teacher characteristics, with the poorer schools hiring much younger teachers on average. We interpret this market equilibrium allocation as either deriving from the preferences of young teachers, or as reflecting the low market attractiveness of disadvantaged schools.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disadvantaged schools", "educational inequality", "Teacher labour market", "teacher turnover"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028773516", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"7404224559": {"Name": "Allen R.", "AuthorID": "7404224559", "AffiliationID": "118495485", "AffiliationName": "Education Datalab"}, "7101644478": {"Name": "Burgess S.", "AuthorID": "7101644478", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Bristol"}, "57197643284": {"Name": "Mayo J.", "AuthorID": "57197643284", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Michigan"}}}
