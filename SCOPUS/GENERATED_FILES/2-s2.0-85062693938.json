This understanding of ecomorphological evolution is supported by observations of avian island radiations, such as Darwin\u2019s finches, which display rapid evolution of skull shape in response to food resource availability and a strong fit between cranial phenotype and trophic ecology. However, a recent analysis of larger clades has suggested that diet is not necessarily a primary driver of cranial shape and that phylogeny and allometry are more significant factors in skull evolution. We use phenome-scale morphometric data across the breadth of extant bird diversity to test the influence of diet and foraging behaviour in shaping cranial evolution. We demonstrate that these trophic characters are significant but very weak predictors of cranial form at this scale. However, dietary groups exhibit significantly different rates of morphological evolution across multiple cranial regions. Granivores and nectarivores exhibit the highest rates of evolution in the face and cranial vault, whereas terrestrial carnivores evolve the slowest. The basisphenoid, occipital, and jaw joint regions have less extreme differences among dietary groups. These patterns demonstrate that dietary niche shapes the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution in deep time, despite a weaker than expected form\u2013function relationship across large clades.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cranial morphology", "Diet", "Macroevolution", "Niche"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biological Evolution", "Birds", "Diet", "Life History Traits", "Phylogeny", "Skull"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062693938", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Environmental Science (all)", "ENVI", "2300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"56070077400": {"Name": "Felice R.N.", "AuthorID": "56070077400", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "57217064372": {"Name": "Pigot A.L.", "AuthorID": "57217064372", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biodiversity and Environment Research, Department of Genetics, Evolution, and Environment, University College London"}, "14068896700": {"Name": "Goswami A.", "AuthorID": "14068896700", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "7202182903": {"Name": "Tobias J.A.", "AuthorID": "7202182903", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London"}}}
