The color ratio (CR) method, which relates the wavelength-dependent absorption of the FUV spectra to the mean energy of the precipitating electrons, allowed us to determine important characteristics of the entire auroral region. The results show that the spatial distribution of the precipitating electron energy is far from uniform. The morning main emission arc is associated with mean energies of around 265 keV, the afternoon main emission (kink region) has energies near 105 keV, while the 'flare' emissions poleward of the main oval are characterized by electrons in the 50-85. keV range. A small scale structure observed in the discontinuity region is related to electrons of 232 keV and the Ganymede footprint shows energies of 157 keV. Interestingly, each specific region shows very similar behavior for the two separate observations.The Io footprint shows a weak but undeniable hydrocarbon absorption, which is not consistent with altitudes of the Io emission profiles (~900 km relative to the 1 bar level) determined from HST-ACS observations. An upward shift of the hydrocarbon homopause of at least 100 km is required to reconcile the high altitude of the emission and hydrocarbon absorption. The relationship between the energy fluxes and the electron energies has been compared to curves obtained from Knight's theory of field-aligned currents. Assuming a fixed electron temperature of 2.5 keV, an electron source population density of ~800 m-3 and ~2400 m-3 is obtained for the morning main emission and kink regions, respectively. Magnetospheric electron densities are lowered for the morning main emission (~600 m-3) if the relativistic version of Knight's theory is applied.Lyman and Werner H2 emission profiles, resulting from secondary electrons produced by precipitation of heavy ions in the 1-2 MeV/u range, have been applied to our model. The low CR obtained from this emission suggests that heavy ions, presumably the main source of the X-ray aurora, do not significantly contribute to typical UV high latitude emission.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aurorae", "Hubble Space Telescope observations", "Jupiter, atmosphere", "Jupiter, magnetosphere", "Spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954546098", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"23990606600": {"Name": "Gustin J.", "AuthorID": "23990606600", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "8286503700": {"Name": "Grodent D.", "AuthorID": "8286503700", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "16425277400": {"Name": "Bonfond B.", "AuthorID": "16425277400", "AffiliationID": "60000964", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Physique Atmosph\u00e9rique et Plan\u00e9taire, Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge"}, "26022604500": {"Name": "Ray L.", "AuthorID": "26022604500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6602683160": {"Name": "Bunce E.", "AuthorID": "6602683160", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "57203043672": {"Name": "Nichols J.", "AuthorID": "57203043672", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Leicester"}, "36608851900": {"Name": "Ozak N.", "AuthorID": "36608851900", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Weizmann Institute of Science"}}}
