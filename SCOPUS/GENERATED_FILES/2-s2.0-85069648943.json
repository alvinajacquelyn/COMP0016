We aimed to evaluate the influence of osteotomy gap on osteotomy healing between the previously published extremes of guaranteed union (0.5 mm) and non-union (3 mm) using this model. A femoral osteotomy in 12\u201314 week old female Wistar rats was stabilised with a micro fixator (titanium blocks, carbon fiber bars) with an osteotomy gap of 1.0 mm (n = 5), 1.5 mm (n = 7), 2.0 mm (n = 6). After five weeks, the left femur was retrieved. The osteotomy gap was scanned using X-ray microtomography and then histologically evaluated. The radiographic union rate (complete mineralised bone bridging across the osteotomy) was three times higher for the 1.0 mm than the 2.0 mm gap. The 1.0 mm gap had the largest callus (0.069\u03bcm3) and bone volume (0.035\u03bcm3). Callus and bone volume were approximately 50% smaller within the 2.0 mm gap. Using cadaveric rat femurs stabilised with the external fixator, day 0 mechanical assessment of construct stiffness was calculated on materials testing machine displacement vs load output. The construct stiffness for the 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm gaps was 32.6 \u00b1 5.4, 32.5 \u00b1 2.4, and 32.4 \u00b1 8.3 N/mm (p = 0.779). Interfragmentary strain (IFS) was calculated using the change in osteotomy gap displacement as measured using microstrain miniature differential reluctance transducer spanning the osteotomy gap. Increasing the gap size significantly reduced the IFS (p = 0.013). The mean \u2018day 0\u2019 IFS for the 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 mm gaps were 11.2 \u00b1 1.3, 8.4 \u00b1 1.5 and 6.1 \u00b1 1.2% respectively. A 1.5 mm gap resulted in a delayed fracture healing by 5 weeks and may represent a useful test environment for fracture healing therapy. Increasing gap size did not affect construct stiffness, but did reduce the \u2018day 0\u2019 IFS, with a doubling of non-union and halving of bone volume measured between 1.0 and 2.0 mm gaps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Delayed-union", "Fracture biomechanics", "Fracture healing", "Interfragmentary strain", "Non-union", "Rodent"], "IndexKeywords": ["Delayed-union", "External fixator", "Female Wistar rats", "Femoral fractures", "Fracture healing", "Non-union", "Rodent", "X ray microtomography", "Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "External Fixators", "Female", "Femoral Fractures", "Femur", "Fracture Fixation", "Fracture Healing", "Osteotomy", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069648943", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"26429775100": {"Name": "Meeson R.", "AuthorID": "26429775100", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Royal Veterinary College"}, "24173602100": {"Name": "Moazen M.", "AuthorID": "24173602100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "57193155068": {"Name": "Sanghani-Kerai A.", "AuthorID": "57193155068", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, University College London"}, "57207710291": {"Name": "Osagie-Clouard L.", "AuthorID": "57207710291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery, University College London"}, "6603029220": {"Name": "Coathup M.", "AuthorID": "6603029220", "AffiliationID": "60022144", "AffiliationName": "University of Central Florida"}, "57206307303": {"Name": "Blunn G.", "AuthorID": "57206307303", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "University of Portsmouth"}}}
