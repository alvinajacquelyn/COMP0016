The identification and extraction of accurate spatial information relating to urban areas is essential for future sustainable city planning owing to its importance within global environmental change and human\u2013environ-ment interactions. However, monitoring urban expansion using medium resolution (30\u2013250 m) imagery remains challenging due to the variety of surface materials that contribute to measured reflectance resulting in spectrally mixed pixels. This research integrates high spatial resolution orthophotos and Landsat imagery to identify differences across a range of diverse urban subsets within the rapidly expanding Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR), Western Australia. Results indicate that calibrating Landsat-derived subpixel land-cover estimates with correction values (calculated from spatially explicit comparisons of subpixel Landsat values to classified high-resolution data which accounts for over [under] estimations of Landsat) reduces moderate resolution urban area over (under) estimates by on an average 55.08% for the PMR. This approach can be applied to other urban areas globally through use of frequently available and/or low-cost high spatial resolution imagery (e.g. using Google Earth). This will improve urban growth estimations to help monitor and measure change whilst providing metrics to facilitate sustainable urban development targets within cities around the world.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Global environmental change", "High resolution data", "High spatial resolution", "High spatial resolution imagery", "Land cover classification", "Metropolitan regions", "Spatial informations", "Sustainable urban development"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037525615", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57194212139": {"Name": "Maclachlan A.", "AuthorID": "57194212139", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment, The University of Southampton"}, "10143371500": {"Name": "Roberts G.", "AuthorID": "10143371500", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment, The University of Southampton"}, "36975075700": {"Name": "Biggs E.", "AuthorID": "36975075700", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "UWA School of Agriculture and Environment, The University of Western Australia"}, "7801342852": {"Name": "Boruff B.", "AuthorID": "7801342852", "AffiliationID": "60031806", "AffiliationName": "UWA School of Agriculture and Environment, The University of Western Australia"}}}
