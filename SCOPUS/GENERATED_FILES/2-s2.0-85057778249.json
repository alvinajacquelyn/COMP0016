We hypothesise that if damage to temporalis muscle were a contributor, the thickness of soft tissue and bone in the affected area would be reduced. Materials and methods: Soft tissues and bone were separately segmented and reconstructed three-dimensionally from computed tomograms of 8 patients 1.5\u201318 years post-FOR performed at 16 \u00b1 2 months for metopic synostosis and from 8 age-matched controls. Soft tissue (taken as proxy for temporalis muscle) and bone thickness overall and in the indented areas were computed. Results: Post-FOR, three-dimensional soft tissue thickness maps demonstrated temporalis extending upwards but falling short of the indented area. Overall skull thickness increased with age post-FOR (logarithmic fit R2 = 0.71) and for controls (R2 = 0.90). Although immediately post-FOR the future indented area had a thickness of 98% of control, it decreased linearly to 64% 16 years later (Pearson's r = 0.84). Conclusion: These findings suggest that late post-FOR deformity/indentation is enhanced by limited upward extension (or retraction downwards) of temporalis muscle, while bone thickness in the affected area gradually decreases. This supports the hypothesis that aberrant re-attachment of the temporalis muscle makes a material contribution to late deformity following FOR for metopic synostosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Metopic synostosis", "Postoperative complications", "Reconstructive surgical procedures", "Temporal muscle"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Bone Remodeling", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Craniosynostoses", "Frontal Bone", "Humans", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Infant", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Skull", "Temporal Muscle", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057778249", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Oral Surgery", "DENT", "3504"], ["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"]], "AuthorData": {"55539055900": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Florez N.", "AuthorID": "55539055900", "AffiliationID": "60080988", "AffiliationName": "Surface Technologies, Mondragon University"}, "57204909124": {"Name": "Florez-Tapia A.", "AuthorID": "57204909124", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55401970300": {"Name": "Jeelani N.U.O.", "AuthorID": "55401970300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "13410386200": {"Name": "Schievano S.", "AuthorID": "13410386200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7003742514": {"Name": "Dunaway D.J.", "AuthorID": "7003742514", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "35495822100": {"Name": "Hayward R.D.", "AuthorID": "35495822100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Craniofacial Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}}}
