Here, we present original analytical data on copper-base artefacts from several Bronze Age and Iron Age sites in Myanmar. Observed microstructures range from as-cast, worked, to fully annealed; compositions include leaded copper, low-tin to high-tin bronzes, and arsenical copper/bronze. Lead isotope analyses indicate that the metal originates from different geological sources, including several that match the lead isotope signatures of known prehistoric copper mines in Thailand and Laos. These archaeometallurgical data, including evidence for secondary copper-base production, more than double those currently available for Myanmar and document the presence of multiple local alloying and working traditions, perhaps chronologically differentiated, as well as identifying possible links to primary mineral sources across the region. Overall, this adds significant new information to the emerging picture of Southeast Asian prehistoric metallurgy at the crossroads of several major ancient cultures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Lead isotope analysis", "Metal exchange networks", "Myanmar", "Southeast Asia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041579608", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Anthropology", "SOCI", "3314"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"20434509200": {"Name": "Pryce T.O.", "AuthorID": "20434509200", "AffiliationID": "60106064, 60019615", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Arch\u00e9omat\u00e9riaux et Pr\u00e9vision de l\u2019Alt\u00e9ration : LMC IRAMAT UMR5060 CNRS et NIMBE UMR3685 CEA/CNRS"}, "57200552431": {"Name": "Pradier B.", "AuthorID": "57200552431", "AffiliationID": "60017338, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "C.N.R.S., UMR 7055 Pr\u00e9histoire et Technologie, Universit\u00e9 de Paris Ouest la D\u00e9fense"}, "7006776948": {"Name": "Vega E.", "AuthorID": "7006776948", "AffiliationID": "60106064, 60019615", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Arch\u00e9omat\u00e9riaux et Pr\u00e9vision de l\u2019Alt\u00e9ration : LMC IRAMAT UMR5060 CNRS et NIMBE UMR3685 CEA/CNRS"}, "57200546724": {"Name": "Htwe K.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57200546724", "AffiliationID": "100439926", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, Dagon University"}, "14719256100": {"Name": "Georgakopoulou M.", "AuthorID": "14719256100", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar, University College London"}, "57200538737": {"Name": "Martin T.", "AuthorID": "57200538737", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar, University College London"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60111307, 60104772", "AffiliationName": "College for Humanities and Social Sciences, Hamad Bin Khalifa University"}, "57204300278": {"Name": "Win T.T.", "AuthorID": "57204300278", "AffiliationID": "120187074", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture"}, "57200549128": {"Name": "Win T.T.", "AuthorID": "57200549128", "AffiliationID": "120187074", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture"}, "6506917007": {"Name": "Petchey P.", "AuthorID": "6506917007", "AffiliationID": "60017311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anthropology and Archaeology, University of Otago"}, "57194773191": {"Name": "Innanchai J.", "AuthorID": "57194773191", "AffiliationID": "120186649", "AffiliationName": "Independent Scholar"}}}
