In this report, we describe a fully automated multi-resolution DTM processing chain developed by the Imaging Group at UCL-MSSL, called CASP-GO based upon the heritage NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline (ASP) and the Gotcha image matcher. The CASP-GO system has been integrated into the Microsoft Azure cloud computing environment and successfully processed \u223c5,300 unique CTX DTMs covering \u223c19% of the Martian surface at 18m resolution.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D model", "CASP-GO", "Cloud computing", "CTX", "DTM", "Mars", "Stereo"], "IndexKeywords": ["3 d model retrievals", "3-d modeling", "3-d surface modelling", "CASP-GO", "Cloud computing environments", "Cloud computing platforms", "Mars", "Stereo"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057334227", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56539197700": {"Name": "Tao Y.", "AuthorID": "56539197700", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7404871794": {"Name": "Muller J.P.", "AuthorID": "7404871794", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Imaging Group, Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
