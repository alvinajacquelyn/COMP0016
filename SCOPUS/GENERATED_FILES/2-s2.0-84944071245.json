Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermo-gravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman microscopy demonstrate the successful reduction of Pd(ii), GO and the biomass, resulting in the formation of Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on an rGO-biomass hybrid. The distribution of the NPs was found to be dependent on the type of reducing agent. PdNPs formed on rGO sheets showed relatively uniform distribution and size control (2-5 nm), whereas PdNPs on the bacterial scaffold were larger (up to 10 nm in size). Raman spectroscopy studies suggest that the presence of Pd leads to oxygen reduction and increased crystallinity in the bacterial biomass. Previous studies have suggested the potential for a bacterially-supported Pd electrocatalyst in fuel cells and, independently, the suitability of rGO as a support for PdNPs. This study confirms the simultaneous bacterial reduction of Pd(ii) and GO and the association between the bacterial cells and rGO. We suggest that the simultaneous presence of E. coli and mild reducing agent together with GO and Pd(ii) creates an interactive and synergistic environment in a hybrid material to allow (a) better control of PdNP size and distribution both on the inside of the bacterial membrane and on the rGO sheets and (b) increased crystallinity of the bacterial biomass compared to systems with bacteria alone.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bacterial biomass", "Bacterial membranes", "Bacterial reduction", "Escherichia coli (E. coli)", "PD nano particle", "Raman microscopy", "Simultaneous reduction", "Uniform distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944071245", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"]], "AuthorData": {"56900946400": {"Name": "Priestley R.", "AuthorID": "56900946400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham Edgbaston"}, "56900841700": {"Name": "Mansfield A.", "AuthorID": "56900841700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham Edgbaston"}, "56900954400": {"Name": "Bye J.", "AuthorID": "56900954400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham Edgbaston"}, "55734231700": {"Name": "Sharma S.", "AuthorID": "55734231700", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Research, School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham Edgbaston"}, "16199689400": {"Name": "Deplanche K.", "AuthorID": "16199689400", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Bionanomaterials, School of Bioscience, University of Birmingham Edgbaston"}, "7006768226": {"Name": "Macaskie L.", "AuthorID": "7006768226", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Bionanomaterials, School of Bioscience, University of Birmingham Edgbaston"}, "7005222072": {"Name": "Jorge A.", "AuthorID": "7005222072", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Chemical Engineering Department, Electrochemical Innovation Lab Torrington Place"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Chemical Engineering Department, Electrochemical Innovation Lab Torrington Place"}}}
