The lack of an edge between two companies indicates the impossibility of labor flows between them due to high frictions. In equilibrium, firms\u2019 hiring behavior correlates through the network, generating highly disaggregated local unemployment. Hence, aggregation depends on the topology of the network in non-trivial ways. This theory provides new micro-foundations for the Beveridge curve, wage dispersion, and the employer-size premium. We apply our model to employer-employee matched records and find that network topologies with Pareto-distributed connections cause disproportionately large changes on aggregate unemployment under high labor supply elasticity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aggregation", "Job search", "Labor flows", "Networks", "Unemployment"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062473567", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"7006823794": {"Name": "Axtell R.", "AuthorID": "7006823794", "AffiliationID": "60030961", "AffiliationName": "Santa Fe Institute"}, "56817985100": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez E.", "AuthorID": "56817985100", "AffiliationID": "60030961", "AffiliationName": "Santa Fe Institute"}, "55511204700": {"Name": "Guerrero O.", "AuthorID": "55511204700", "AffiliationID": "60103653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Aalto University"}}}
