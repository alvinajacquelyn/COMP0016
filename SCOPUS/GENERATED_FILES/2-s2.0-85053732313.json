Spanish-speaking participants learned the spoken forms of novel words in their native language (Spanish) or in a different language (Hungarian), which were paired with pictures of familiar or unfamiliar objects, or no picture. We thereby assessed, in a factorial way, the impact of existing knowledge (schema) on word learning by manipulating both semantic (familiar vs unfamiliar objects) and phonological (L1- vs L2-like novel words) familiarity. Participants were trained and tested with a 12-hr intervening period that included overnight sleep or daytime awake. Our results showed (1) benefits of sleep to recognition memory that were greater for words with L2-like phonology and (2) that learned associations with familiar but not unfamiliar pictures enhanced recognition memory for novel words. Implications for complementary systems accounts of word learning are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Consolidation", "L1", "L2", "Phonology", "Schema", "Semantic", "Sleep", "Word learning"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Association Learning", "Choice Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Memory", "Phonetics", "Reaction Time", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Semantics", "Sleep", "Verbal Learning", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053732313", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"54581043000": {"Name": "Havas V.", "AuthorID": "54581043000", "AffiliationID": "60013141", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Literature, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"}, "55653107600": {"Name": "Vaquero L.", "AuthorID": "55653107600", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cognition, Development and Educational Psychology, University of Barcelona"}, "14621432100": {"Name": "de Diego-Balaguer R.", "AuthorID": "14621432100", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60104667", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurosciences, University of Barcelona"}, "35234806900": {"Name": "Rodr\u00edguez-Fornells A.", "AuthorID": "35234806900", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "Instituci\u00f3 Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avan\u00e7ats (ICREA)"}, "35211847200": {"Name": "Taylor J.S.H.", "AuthorID": "35211847200", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "57219322603": {"Name": "Davis M.H.", "AuthorID": "57219322603", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60029069", "AffiliationName": "Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Medical Research Council"}}}
