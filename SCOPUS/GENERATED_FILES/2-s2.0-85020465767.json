In this article I suggest that the publication of the Notebooks indeed provides a deeper understanding of Heidegger's entanglement with National Socialism. Yet rather than viewing this entanglement as cause to reject his work, I examine how it might help us to define philosophy's role in the project of building a society in which Nazism is impossible. Through reference to Heidegger's public voice during the years covered by the first three volumes of the Black Notebooks I identify a paradox in his thought: Heidegger powerfully diagnoses modernity's penchant to encase the natural and social orders in a determinate ontology, and yet his diagnosis introduces a new kind of determination that actively sides with totalitarianism. By representing the political sphere as the site of ontological movement, Heidegger opens us to the fluidity of politics only to obfuscate the priority of action. Through attending to this paradox I argue that the way of thinking capable of responding to the problems of modern politics cannot be ontological but must be political - with others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Black Notebooks", "Martin Heidegger", "National Socialism", "politics", "Sophocles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020465767", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"57146117900": {"Name": "Cooper A.", "AuthorID": "57146117900", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Internationales Zentrum f\u00fcr Philosophie, Universit\u00e4t Bonn"}}}
