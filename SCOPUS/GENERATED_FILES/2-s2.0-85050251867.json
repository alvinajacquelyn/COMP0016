All Rights Reserved.The typological feature \u2018post-focus fo range compression\u2019 (PFC) is often considered an all-or-nothing phenomenon, being completely absent in -PFC languages but applied across-theboard in +PFC languages. This paper presents production data from Japanese and shows that, within a language, the realisation of PFC can be conditional upon lexical prosody. We further argue that this condition itself is language-specific, by comparing Japanese PFC with that in other +PFC languages. It is hoped that these results will further our understanding of the nature of focus intonation across languages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Japanese", "Pitch accent", "Post-focus compression"], "IndexKeywords": ["All or nothings", "Japanese", "Pitch accents", "Production data", "Range compression"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050251867", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"55658303800": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "55658303800", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "University of Tokyo"}, "55695016900": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "55695016900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
