Re-use permitted under CC BY. Published by BMJ.Aim To identify the key components of natriuretic peptide (NP)-guided treatment interventions which reduced hospitalisation in patients with heart failure (HF). Methods and results We extracted detailed information on the components of interventions from studies of NP-guided treatment of HF identified in a previous systematic review. We used meta-regression techniques to assess univariate associations between components and the strength of the reduction in HF hospitalisations and all-cause mortality. A Bayesian meta-analysis approach was used to re-estimate study-level effects in order to identify the study with the most effective NP-guided monitoring intervention. Finally, we examined the intervention options common to the studies in which the 95% credible interval excluded no effect. We identified eight components of NP-guided treatment from ten studies. Univariate comparisons produced mainly equivocal results, but single trial choice and common components analysis led to similar conclusions. Using a predefined treatment protocol, setting a stringent NP target (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide of 1000 pg/mL or B-type natriuretic peptide 100 pg/mL) and including a relative targetwere potential key components to reducing HF hospitalisations using NP-guided therapy. Conclusion This analysis provides a description of the key components of NP-guided treatment which could help policy makers develop specific recommendations for HF management. Our research suggests that NP-guided interventions could be simplified, but more research in relevant health settings, such as primary care, is required.", "AuthorKeywords": ["heart failure", "monitoring", "natriuretic peptides", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054744288", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"37018670900": {"Name": "Oke J.", "AuthorID": "37018670900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7006205013": {"Name": "Clements A.", "AuthorID": "7006205013", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "55330280100": {"Name": "McLellan J.", "AuthorID": "55330280100", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7005395035": {"Name": "Bankhead C.", "AuthorID": "7005395035", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "7404822567": {"Name": "Taylor C.J.", "AuthorID": "7404822567", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "57220418090": {"Name": "Spence G.", "AuthorID": "57220418090", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "57203214133": {"Name": "Perera R.", "AuthorID": "57203214133", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford"}, "57208560645": {"Name": "Banerjee A.", "AuthorID": "57208560645", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Farr Institute of Health Informatics Research, University College London"}}}
