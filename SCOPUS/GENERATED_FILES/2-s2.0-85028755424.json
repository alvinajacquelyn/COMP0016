On tuning the coupling between the QPC and the electronic cavity, fine oscillations are observed when the arch QPC is operated in the quasi-1D regime. These oscillations correspond to interference between the 1D states and a state which is similar to the Fabry-Perot state and suppressed by a small transverse magnetic field of \u00b160 mT. Tuning the reflector, we find a peak in resistance which follows the behavior expected for a Fano resonance. We suggest that this is an interesting example of a Fano resonance in an open system which corresponds to interference at or near the Ohmic contacts due to a directly propagating, reflected discrete path and the continuum states of the cavity corresponding to multiple scattering. Remarkably, the Fano factor shows an oscillatory behavior taking peaks for each fine oscillation, thus, confirming coupling between the discrete and continuum states. The results indicate that such a simple quantum device can be used as building blocks to create more complex integrated quantum circuits for possible applications ranging from quantum-information processing to realizing the fundamentals of complex quantum systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Building blockes", "Complex quantum systems", "Interference effects", "Oscillatory behaviors", "Quantum interference", "Quantum point contact", "Quantum-information processing", "Transverse magnetic field"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028755424", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193274229": {"Name": "Yan C.", "AuthorID": "57193274229", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield"}, "57202530291": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "57202530291", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "56463590500": {"Name": "Pepper M.", "AuthorID": "56463590500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701461985": {"Name": "See P.", "AuthorID": "6701461985", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "National Physical Laboratory"}, "8546355000": {"Name": "Farrer I.", "AuthorID": "8546355000", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "36050490200": {"Name": "Ritchie D.", "AuthorID": "36050490200", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "57203312733": {"Name": "Griffiths J.", "AuthorID": "57203312733", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}, "57056797900": {"Name": "Jones G.", "AuthorID": "57056797900", "AffiliationID": "60121115", "AffiliationName": "Cavendish Laboratory"}}}
