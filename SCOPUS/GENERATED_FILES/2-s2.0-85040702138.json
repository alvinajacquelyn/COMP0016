British Journal of Dermatology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Association of Dermatologists.Background : Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Doxycycline and prednisolone to treat bullous pemphigoid were compared within a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Objectives : To compare the cost-effectiveness of doxycycline-initiated and prednisolone-initiated treatment for patients with BP. Methods : Quality-of-life (EuroQoL-5D-3L) and resource data were collected as part of the BLISTER trial: a multicentre, parallel-group, investigator-blinded RCT. Within-trial analysis was performed using bivariate regression of costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with multiple imputation of missing data, informing a probabilistic assessment of incremental treatment cost-effectiveness from a health service perspective. Results : In the base case, there was no robust difference in costs or QALYs per patient at 1 year comparing doxycycline- with prednisolone-initiated therapy [net cost \u00a3959, 95% confidence interval (CI) \u2212\u00a324 to \u00a31941; net QALYs \u22120\u00b7024, 95% CI \u22120\u00b7088 to 0\u00b7041]. However, the findings varied by baseline blister severity. For patients with mild or moderate blistering (\u2264 30 blisters) net costs and outcomes were similar. For patients with severe blistering (> 30 blisters) net costs were higher (\u00a32558, 95% CI \u2212\u00a382 to \u00a35198) and quality of life poorer (\u22120\u00b7090 QALYs, 95% CI \u22120\u00b722 to 0\u00b7042) for patients starting on doxycycline. The probability that doxycycline would be cost-effective for those with severe pemphigoid was 1\u00b75% at a willingness to pay of \u00a320 000 per QALY. Conclusions : Consistently with the clinical findings of the BLISTER trial, patients with mild or moderate blistering should receive treatment guided by the safety and effectiveness of the drugs and patient preference \u2013 neither strategy is clearly a preferred use of National Health Service resources. However, prednisolone-initiated treatment may be more cost-effective for patients with severe blistering.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Dermatologic Agents", "Doxycycline", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Pemphigoid, Bullous", "Prednisolone", "Quality of Life", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040702138", "SubjectAreas": [["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"7403552045": {"Name": "Mason J.M.", "AuthorID": "7403552045", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "14420845100": {"Name": "Chalmers J.R.", "AuthorID": "14420845100", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham"}, "7004209019": {"Name": "Kirtschig G.", "AuthorID": "7004209019", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham"}, "57202566252": {"Name": "Williams H.C.", "AuthorID": "57202566252", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Centre of Evidence Based Dermatology, University of Nottingham"}, "57217971627": {"Name": "Godec T.", "AuthorID": "57217971627", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "7102771386": {"Name": "Nunn A.J.", "AuthorID": "7102771386", "AffiliationID": "60003108, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL"}, "7101810094": {"Name": "Wojnarowska F.", "AuthorID": "7101810094", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "22833597400": {"Name": "Childs M.", "AuthorID": "22833597400", "AffiliationID": "60030816", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, Nottingham Health Science Partners, QMC"}, "36171332600": {"Name": "Whitham D.", "AuthorID": "36171332600", "AffiliationID": "60030816", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, Nottingham Health Science Partners, QMC"}, "35501678400": {"Name": "Schmidt E.", "AuthorID": "35501678400", "AffiliationID": "60012408", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, University of L\u00fcbeck"}, "7005250038": {"Name": "Harman K.", "AuthorID": "7005250038", "AffiliationID": "60007974, 60028485", "AffiliationName": "Dermatology Department, Leicester Royal Infirmary, University Hospitals Leicester"}, "7103075808": {"Name": "Walton S.", "AuthorID": "7103075808", "AffiliationID": "60025144", "AffiliationName": "Castle Hill Hospital"}, "56473298700": {"Name": "Chapman A.", "AuthorID": "56473298700", "AffiliationID": "112816035", "AffiliationName": "Queen Elizabeth Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
