With whole-genome sequencing, we tested the hypothesis that a cluster of 16 E. cloacae bacteraemia cases in a Nepali neonatal unit represented a single clonal outbreak, using a wider set of epidemiologically unrelated clinical E. cloacae isolates for comparison. Methods: Forty-three isolates were analysed, including 23 E. cloacae and 3 Citrobacter sp. isolates obtained from blood cultures from 16 neonates over a 3 month period. These were compared with two contemporaneous community-associated drug-resistant isolates from adults, a unit soap dispenser isolate and a set of historical invasive isolates (n=14) from the same geographical locality. Results: There were two clear neonatal outbreaks and one isolated case in the unit. One outbreak was associated with an NDM-1 plasmid also identified in a historical community-associated strain. The smaller, second outbreak was likely associated with a contaminated soap dispenser. The two community-acquired adult cases and three sets of historical hospital-associated neonatal isolates represented four additional genetic clusters. Conclusions: E. cloacae infections in this context represent several different transmission networks, operating at the community/hospital and host strain/plasmid levels. Wide sampling frames and high-resolution typing methods are needed to describe the complex molecular epidemiology of E. cloacae outbreaks, which is not appropriately reflected by routine susceptibility phenotypes. Soap dispensers may represent a reservoir for E. cloacae and bacterial strains and plasmids may persist in hospitals and in the community for long periods, sporadically being involved in outbreaks of disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbapenemases", "Epidemiology", "Ndm", "Whole-genome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bacteremia", "Blood", "Cluster Analysis", "Disease Outbreaks", "Disease Transmission, Infectious", "DNA, Bacterial", "Enterobacter cloacae", "Enterobacteriaceae Infections", "Environmental Microbiology", "Genome, Bacterial", "Genotype", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Intensive Care Units, Neonatal", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Nepal", "Retrospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926462931", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"16242353500": {"Name": "Stoesser N.", "AuthorID": "16242353500", "AffiliationID": "60008936, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "56428668100": {"Name": "Sheppard A.E.", "AuthorID": "56428668100", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60170323, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "53663441600": {"Name": "Giess A.", "AuthorID": "53663441600", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60170323, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "36162301400": {"Name": "Kelly D.", "AuthorID": "36162301400", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Vaccine Group, Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7103193821": {"Name": "Pollard A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103193821", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Vaccine Group, Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, University of Oxford"}, "7005772816": {"Name": "Peto T.E.A.", "AuthorID": "7005772816", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60170323, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "35402208300": {"Name": "Walker A.S.", "AuthorID": "35402208300", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60170323, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7102132600": {"Name": "Crook D.W.", "AuthorID": "7102132600", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60170323, 60172675", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, University of Oxford, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "55777839700": {"Name": "Shakya M.", "AuthorID": "55777839700", "AffiliationID": "60071820", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Patan Hospital"}, "57188859754": {"Name": "Sthapit B.", "AuthorID": "57188859754", "AffiliationID": "60071820", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Patan Hospital"}, "36895373500": {"Name": "Thorson S.", "AuthorID": "36895373500", "AffiliationID": "60071820", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatrics, Patan Hospital"}}}
