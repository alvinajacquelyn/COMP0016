There are very few instruments for assessing potential technological addiction to mobile phones, or for categorizing different types of users or uses. The most widely used scale is the Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale (MPPUS), which is used to study adult populations, and has been applied in various forms in international contexts. The aims of this study were to adapt the Spanish version of this scale (MPPUSA) to British adolescents, and then to estimate the prevalence of possible problematic users. A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 1,529 secondary school pupils aged between 11 and 18 years, with 1,026 completed questionnaires being collected. The analysis showed that the factor and construct validity and reliability were comparable to those obtained in previous studies. The prevalence of problematic users among the students was 10%, and the typical problematic user tended to be an adolescent between 11 and 14 years old, studying in a public school, who considered themselves to be an expert user of this technology, who made extensive use of his/her mobile phone, and who attributed the same problem of use among their peers. These users presented notable scores in all the symptoms covered by the scale used to assess problematic use. In conclusion, the adaptation of the MPPUSA as a screening scale for British adolescents presents good sensitivity and specificity for detecting the main addictive symptoms proposed in this validated version. \u00a9 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84893908732", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Applied Psychology", "PSYC", "3202"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"25922646600": {"Name": "Lopez-Fernandez O.", "AuthorID": "25922646600", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Psychology, Campus Mundet, University of Barcelona"}, "6506853100": {"Name": "Honrubia-Serrano L.", "AuthorID": "6506853100", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Faculty of Psychology, University of Barcelona"}, "6506681193": {"Name": "Freixa-Blanxart M.", "AuthorID": "6506681193", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Faculty of Psychology, University of Barcelona"}, "55588397700": {"Name": "Gibson W.", "AuthorID": "55588397700", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "Department of Culture, Communication and Media, Doctoral School, University of London"}}}
