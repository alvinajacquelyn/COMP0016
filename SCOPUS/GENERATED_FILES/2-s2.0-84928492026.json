KGaA, Weinheim.A library of 5-methylindolo[3,2-c]quinolones (IQc) with various substitution patterns of alkyldiamine side chains were evaluated for G-quadruplex (G4) binding mode and efficiency. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer melting assays showed that IQcs with a positive charge in the heteroaromatic nucleus and two weakly basic side chains are potent and selective human telomeric (HT) and gene promoter G4 stabilizers. Spectroscopic studies with HT G4 as a model showed that an IQc stabilizing complex involves the binding of two IQc molecules (2,9-bis{[3-(diethylamino)propyl]amino}-5-methyl-11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-5-ium chloride, 3 d) per G4 unit, in two non-independent but equivalent binding sites. Molecular dynamics studies suggest that end-stacking of 3 d induces a conformational rearrangement in the G4 structure, driving the binding of a second 3 d ligand to a G4 groove. Modeling studies also suggest that 3 d, with two three-carbon side chains, has the appropriate geometry to participate in direct or water-mediated hydrogen bonding to the phosphate backbone and/or G4 loops, assisted by the terminal nitrogen atoms of the side chains. Additionally, antiproliferative studies showed that IQc compounds 2 d (2-{[3-(diethylamino)propyl]amino}-5-methyl-11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-5-ium chloride) and 3 d are 7- to 12-fold more selective for human malignant cell lines than for nonmalignant fibroblasts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["antitumor agents", "cancer", "G-quadruplexes", "indolo[3,2-c]quinolones", "molecular dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Binding Sites", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "G-Quadruplexes", "Humans", "Indoles", "Models, Molecular", "Molecular Structure", "Quinolines", "Spectrometry, Fluorescence", "Structure-Activity Relationship", "Telomere"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928492026", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"23489277100": {"Name": "Lavrado J.", "AuthorID": "23489277100", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Medicines (IMed.ULisboa), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7102554088": {"Name": "Moreira R.", "AuthorID": "7102554088", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Medicines (IMed.ULisboa), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7003821508": {"Name": "Paulo A.", "AuthorID": "7003821508", "AffiliationID": "60106051", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute for Medicines (IMed.ULisboa), Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "6506607447": {"Name": "Ohnmacht S.A.", "AuthorID": "6506607447", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56596379800": {"Name": "Leit\u00e3o C.", "AuthorID": "56596379800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56088486300": {"Name": "Pisco S.", "AuthorID": "56088486300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "12042112000": {"Name": "Gunaratnam M.", "AuthorID": "12042112000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "35820006900": {"Name": "Neidle S.", "AuthorID": "35820006900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "7003557498": {"Name": "Correia I.", "AuthorID": "7003557498", "AffiliationID": "60004956, 60106051, 60030580", "AffiliationName": "Centro Qu\u00edmica Estrutural, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Universidade de Lisboa"}, "7101668405": {"Name": "Santos D.J.V.A.D.", "AuthorID": "7101668405", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto"}}}
