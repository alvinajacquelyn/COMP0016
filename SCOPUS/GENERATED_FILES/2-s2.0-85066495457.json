We use a Bayesian additive conditional bivariate copula regression model with sinh-arcsinh marginal densities with location, scale, and shape parameters that depend smoothly on a covariate. We perform Bayesian inference about the unknown quantities of our model using a specially tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We gain new insights about the processes, which determine transformations in visual acuity with respect to age, including the nature of joint changes in both eyes as modelled with the age-related copula dependence parameter. We analyse posterior predictive distributions to identify children with unusual sight characteristics, distinguishing those who are bivariate, but not univariate outliers. In this way, we provide an innovative tool that enables clinicians to identify children with unusual sight who may otherwise be missed. We compare our simultaneous Bayesian method with a two-step frequentist generalised additive modelling approach.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian dependence modelling", "conditional copulas", "generalised additive models for location", "scale and shape (gamlss)", "sinh-arcsinh distribution", "visual acuity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Algorithms", "Bayes Theorem", "Biostatistics", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Computer Simulation", "Data Interpretation, Statistical", "Humans", "Markov Chains", "Models, Statistical", "Monte Carlo Method", "Reference Values", "Vision Tests", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066495457", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"]], "AuthorData": {"6603711275": {"Name": "Stander J.", "AuthorID": "6603711275", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics, University of Plymouth"}, "57218688959": {"Name": "Dalla Valle L.", "AuthorID": "57218688959", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing, Electronics and Mathematics, University of Plymouth"}, "57209099197": {"Name": "Taglioni C.", "AuthorID": "57209099197", "AffiliationID": "60000481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Padova"}, "6506244078": {"Name": "Liseo B.", "AuthorID": "6506244078", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Methods and Models for Territories, Economy and Finance, University of Rome La Sapienza"}, "7202754332": {"Name": "Wade A.", "AuthorID": "7202754332", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "26643625100": {"Name": "Cortina-Borja M.", "AuthorID": "26643625100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}}}
