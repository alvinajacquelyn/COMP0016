While many of these mappings can be characterized by broad generalizations, both within and across languages (e.g., semantic agents tend to be mapped onto syntactic subjects), not all verbs fit neatly into these generalizations. One particularly striking example is verbs of psychological state: The experiencer of the state can appear as either the subject (Agnes fears/hates/loves Bartholomew) or the direct object (Agnes frightens/angers/delights Bartholomew). The present studies explore whether this apparent variability in subject/object mapping may actually result from differences in these verbs\u2019 underlying meanings. Specifically, we suggest that verbs like fear describe a habitual attitude towards some entity whereas verbs like frighten describe an externally caused emotional episode. We find that this distinction systematically characterizes verbs in English, Mandarin, and Korean. This pattern is generalized to novel verbs by adults in English, Japanese, and Russian, and even by English-speaking children who are just beginning to acquire psych verbs. This results support a broad role for systematic mappings between semantics and syntax in language acquisition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Argument structure", "Psych verbs", "Psychological states", "Thematic roles", "Verbs"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cross-Cultural Comparison", "Emotions", "Fear", "Humans", "Language Development", "Linguistics", "Middle Aged", "Semantics", "Vocabulary", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989345378", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"23027586700": {"Name": "Hartshorne J.K.", "AuthorID": "23027586700", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Harvard University"}, "56368153500": {"Name": "O'Donnell T.J.", "AuthorID": "56368153500", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Harvard University"}, "55750238500": {"Name": "Uruwashi M.", "AuthorID": "55750238500", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Harvard University"}, "6603155929": {"Name": "Snedeker J.", "AuthorID": "6603155929", "AffiliationID": "60009982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Harvard University"}, "56255207300": {"Name": "Sudo Y.", "AuthorID": "56255207300", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "56142793200": {"Name": "Lee M.", "AuthorID": "56142793200", "AffiliationID": "60024872", "AffiliationName": "Department of English Language and Literature, Hanyang University"}}}
