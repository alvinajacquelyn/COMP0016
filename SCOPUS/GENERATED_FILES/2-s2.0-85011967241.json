The proposed TX utilizes the received dedicated RF signal for both energy harvesting as well as frequency synthesis. A TX RF carrier is derived from the received RF signal by means of a delay locked loop and XOR-based frequency multiplier. The 50- $\\Omega $ load is subsequently driven by a tuned switching RF power amplifier (PA) with 25% duty cycle input for high global efficiency. The design is fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology and occupies a die area of 0.16 mm2. Experimental results show a rectifier with 36.83% peak efficiency and power management circuit with 120-nA current consumption that enables a low start-up power of -18.4 dBm. The TX outputs a continuous 2.44-GHz RF signal at -2.57 dBm with 36.5% PA drain efficiency and 23.9% global efficiency from a 915-MHz RF input and supports ON-OFF keying modulation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autonomous", "power amplifier (PA)", "radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting", "RF-powered", "sensitivity", "transmitter (TX)", "wireless sensor node (WSN)"], "IndexKeywords": ["Current consumption", "Delay-locked loops", "Frequency multiplier", "Frequency synthesis", "On-off keying modulations", "Power management circuits", "RF power amplifiers", "Wireless sensor node"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011967241", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiation", "PHYS", "3108"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"37013951800": {"Name": "Stoopman M.", "AuthorID": "37013951800", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Section Bioelectronics, Delft University of Technology"}, "7003394632": {"Name": "Serdijn W.", "AuthorID": "7003394632", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Section Bioelectronics, Delft University of Technology"}, "6603822951": {"Name": "Philips K.", "AuthorID": "6603822951", "AffiliationID": "60014979", "AffiliationName": "Holst Centre, IMEC-NL"}}}
