We investigate the structure of the edges of open gaps in the spectrum of H. We show that under arbitrary small perturbation V periodic with respect to N\u0393 where N=N(W) is some integer, all edges of the gaps in the spectrum of H+V which are perturbation of the gaps of H become non-degenerate, i.e. are attained at finitely many points by one band function only and have non-degenerate quadratic minimum/maximum. We also discuss this problem in the discrete setting and show that changing the lattice of periods may indeed be unavoidable to achieve the non-degeneracy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Band functions", "Bloch surfaces", "Periodic operators"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016172720", "SubjectAreas": [["Analysis", "MATH", "2603"]], "AuthorData": {"13608982300": {"Name": "Parnovski L.", "AuthorID": "13608982300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "25634557200": {"Name": "Shterenberg R.", "AuthorID": "25634557200", "AffiliationID": "60027086", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Alabama at Birmingham"}}}
