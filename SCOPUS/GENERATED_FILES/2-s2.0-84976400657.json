Cellularised materials are common in early development and adult tissues where they can be found in the form of cell sheets, cysts, or amorphous aggregates and in pathophysiological conditions such as cancerous tumours. Given the growing realisation that forces can regulate cell physiology and developmental processes, understanding how cellularised materials deform under mechanical stress or dissipate stress appear as key biological questions. In this review, we will discuss the dynamic mechanical properties of cellularised materials devoid of extracellular matrix.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Cell Aggregation", "Cells", "Humans", "Models, Biological", "Morphogenesis", "Rheology"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976400657", "SubjectAreas": [["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55940612800": {"Name": "Khalilgharibi N.", "AuthorID": "55940612800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "35108927300": {"Name": "Fouchard J.", "AuthorID": "35108927300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "57208458979": {"Name": "Charras G.", "AuthorID": "57208458979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "55613061600": {"Name": "Recho P.", "AuthorID": "55613061600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Cambridge University"}, "23008923600": {"Name": "Kabla A.", "AuthorID": "23008923600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, Cambridge University"}}}
