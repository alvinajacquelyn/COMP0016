This extends the capabilities of solution scattering and provides deeper insights into the physics and chemistry of the systems studied. Realizing this potential, however, requires integrating the experimental data with a new generation of modelling software. To achieve this, the CCP-SAS collaboration (http://www.ccpsas.org/) is developing opensource, high-throughput and user-friendly software for the atomistic and coarsegrained molecular modelling of scattering data. Robust state-of-the-art molecular simulation engines and molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo force fields provide constraints to the solution structure inferred from the small-angle scattering data, which incorporates the known physical chemistry of the system. The implementation of this software suite involves a tiered approach in which GenApp provides the deployment infrastructure for running applications on both standard and high-performance computing hardware, and SASSIE provides a workflow framework into which modules can be plugged to prepare structures, carry out simulations, calculate theoretical scattering data and compare results with experimental data. GenApp produces the accessible webbased front end termed SASSIE-web, and GenApp and SASSIE also make community SAS codes available. Applications are illustrated by case studies: (i) inter-domain flexibility in two- to six-domain proteins as exemplified by HIV-1 Gag, MASP and ubiquitin; (ii) the hinge conformation in human IgG2 and IgA1 antibodies; (iii) the complex formed between a hexameric protein Hfq and mRNA; and (iv) synthetic 'bottlebrush' polymers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["molecular dynamics (MD)", "molecular modelling", "scattering curve fits", "small-angle-neutron scattering (SANS)", "smallangle-X-ray scattering (SAXS)"], "IndexKeywords": ["High performance computing", "Molecular simulations", "Running applications", "Scattering curve", "Small angle scattering", "Solution scatterings", "Structural constraints", "User-friendly-software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995394902", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7201961714": {"Name": "Perkins S.J.", "AuthorID": "7201961714", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "56673346700": {"Name": "Wright D.W.", "AuthorID": "56673346700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "55685532500": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "55685532500", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neutron Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "24376735300": {"Name": "Krueger S.", "AuthorID": "24376735300", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neutron Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "7401481435": {"Name": "Curtis J.E.", "AuthorID": "7401481435", "AffiliationID": "60023053", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neutron Research, National Institute of Standards and Technology"}, "16046966300": {"Name": "Brookes E.H.", "AuthorID": "16046966300", "AffiliationID": "60018573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio"}, "23569076900": {"Name": "Chen J.", "AuthorID": "23569076900", "AffiliationID": "60000689", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Kansas State University"}, "16420847400": {"Name": "Irving T.C.", "AuthorID": "16420847400", "AffiliationID": "60002873", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Illinois Institute of Technology"}, "7201365431": {"Name": "Barlow D.J.", "AuthorID": "7201365431", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Pharmacy Department, King's College London, Franklin-Wilkins Building"}, "7003348301": {"Name": "Edler K.J.", "AuthorID": "7003348301", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Bath"}, "57053593000": {"Name": "Scott D.J.", "AuthorID": "57053593000", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Campus"}, "34571184300": {"Name": "King S.M.", "AuthorID": "34571184300", "AffiliationID": "60001724, 60009523, 60023254", "AffiliationName": "ISIS Facility, STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell Campus"}, "6603918549": {"Name": "Terrill N.J.", "AuthorID": "6603918549", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source Ltd, Diamond House, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus"}, "7201399056": {"Name": "Butler P.D.", "AuthorID": "7201399056", "AffiliationID": "60015574", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Tennessee"}}}
