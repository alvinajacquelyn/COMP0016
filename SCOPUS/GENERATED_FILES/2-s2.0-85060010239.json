This solution has advantages as a cost effective indoor wireless infrastructure where flexible transmission schemes are required. Experimental results indicate wide RF dynamic range for two LTE services transmitted simultaneously, showing its capability for creating a neutral-host radio access network (RAN) with good spectral efficiency and cost effectiveness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["digital signal processing", "high speed wireless", "microwave photonics", "Millimetre wave", "radio-over-fibre"], "IndexKeywords": ["Flexible transmissions", "High speed wireless", "Microwave Photonics", "Millimetre waves", "Multi-services", "Radio access networks", "Spectral efficiencies", "Wireless infrastructures"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060010239", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"], ["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"35280298700": {"Name": "Li T.", "AuthorID": "35280298700", "AffiliationID": "60120507, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Photonic Systems, Electrical Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "35394498800": {"Name": "Penty R.", "AuthorID": "35394498800", "AffiliationID": "60120507, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Photonic Systems, Electrical Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "35395011200": {"Name": "White I.", "AuthorID": "35395011200", "AffiliationID": "60120507, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Photonic Systems, Electrical Division, Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge"}, "55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "6701843369": {"Name": "Fice M.", "AuthorID": "6701843369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
