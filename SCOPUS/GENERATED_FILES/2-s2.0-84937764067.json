Med.", "Volume": "75", "Issue": null, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": 75, "PageEnd": 85, "CitedBy": 117, "DOI": "10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.001", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84937764067&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 2015.Objectives: Uncertainty remains about whether personal financial incentives could achieve sustained changes in health-related behaviors that would reduce the fast-growing global non-communicable disease burden. This review aims to estimate whether: i. financial incentives achieve sustained changes in smoking, eating, alcohol consumption and physical activity; ii. effectiveness is modified by (a) the target behavior, (b) incentive value and attainment certainty, (c) recipients' deprivation level. Methods: Multiple sources were searched for trials offering adults financial incentives and assessing outcomes relating to pre-specified behaviors at a minimum of six months from baseline. Analyses included random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions grouped by timed endpoints. Results: Of 24,265 unique identified articles, 34 were included in the analysis. Financial incentives increased behavior-change, with effects sustained until 18. months from baseline (OR: 1.53, 95% CI 1.05-2.23) and three months post-incentive removal (OR: 2.11, 95% CI 1.21-3.67). High deprivation increased incentive effects (OR: 2.17; 95% CI 1.22-3.85), but only at >. 6-12. months from baseline. Other assessed variables did not independently modify effects at any time-point. Conclusions: Personal financial incentives can change habitual health-related behaviors and help reduce health inequalities. However, their role in reducing disease burden is potentially limited given current evidence that effects dissipate beyond three months post-incentive removal.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Financial incentives", "Health promotion", "Health-related behavior", "Meta-analysis", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Financing, Personal", "Habits", "Health Behavior", "Humans", "Motivation", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937764067", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"55154232200": {"Name": "Mantzari E.", "AuthorID": "55154232200", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Behaviour and Health Research Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "7006758192": {"Name": "Marteau T.M.", "AuthorID": "7006758192", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Behaviour and Health Research Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "35575236800": {"Name": "Vogt F.", "AuthorID": "35575236800", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King's College London"}, "6508202986": {"Name": "Shemilt I.", "AuthorID": "6508202986", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Behaviour and Health Research Unit, University of Cambridge"}, "57200843282": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "57200843282", "AffiliationID": "60024779", "AffiliationName": "School of Computing and Mathematics, Plymouth University"}, "55616553600": {"Name": "Higgins J.P.T.", "AuthorID": "55616553600", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York"}}}
