Pain occurs in paroxysms which last from a few seconds to 2 minutes. The frequency of the paroxysms ranges from a few to hundreds of attacks a day. Periods of remission can last for months to years, but tend to shorten over time.METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with trigeminal neuralgia? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).RESULTS: We found 14 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ablative neurosurgical techniques to the Gasserian ganglion, baclofen, carbamazepine, clonazepam, cryotherapy of peripheral nerves, gabapentin, lamotrigine, microvascular decompression, nerve block, oxcarbazepine, peripheral acupuncture, phenytoin, proparacaine eye drops, sodium valproate, stereotactic radiosurgery, tizanidine, and topiramate.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Humans", "Ophthalmic Solutions", "Pain", "Pain Measurement", "Phenytoin", "Radiosurgery", "Trigeminal Ganglion", "Trigeminal Neuralgia"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964987707", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7006163624": {"Name": "Zakrzewska J.M.", "AuthorID": "7006163624", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts and the London Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "7003806610": {"Name": "Linskey M.E.", "AuthorID": "7003806610", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts and the London Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry"}}}
