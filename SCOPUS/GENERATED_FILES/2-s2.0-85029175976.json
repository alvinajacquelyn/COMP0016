The scaling methodology currently used to develop the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) background indices is designed to maximize within-country comparability over time. However, questions remain on the extent to which alternative scaling methodologies can ensure greater cross-country comparability. Establishing indicators of household resources that are comparable both across countries and over time is fundamental to assessing cross-country differences in socioeconomic inequalities in academic achievement. We use multigroup confirmatory factor analysis for categorical variables to examine the measurement equivalence of the household resource factors across the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development countries that participated in the PISA 2000 and 2012 cycles. We construct a series of alternative measures that use students\u2019 reports on the availability of household resources and compare them to the index of home possessions that is generally used in analyses of PISA data. Our findings show that alternative scaling methodologies can be useful in developing cross-country indicators of socioeconomic status.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029175976", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"45561420300": {"Name": "Pokropek A.", "AuthorID": "45561420300", "AffiliationID": "60082549, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "35613910500": {"Name": "Borgonovi F.", "AuthorID": "35613910500", "AffiliationID": "60009357", "AffiliationName": "Department for Education, Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development"}, "36056817500": {"Name": "McCormick C.", "AuthorID": "36056817500", "AffiliationID": "60026306", "AffiliationName": "Buros Center for Testing, University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln"}}}
