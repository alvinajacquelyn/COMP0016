Methods Six 3D tissue models (tumoroids) consisting of cell cultures within a collagen containing hydrogel were constructed after culture centrifugation and direct measurement of the cell component volume. Measured tumoroid ECV ranged from 0.89 to 1. ECV was calculated after measuring the T1 relaxation time at 3 Tesla using inversion recovery relaxometry (TI 100-1500 ms) within the tumoroids and surrounding medium before and 375 min after spiking the medium with Gadolinium (to achieve a concentration of 1.4 mM/L). Linear regression model prediction of directly measured ECV (ECVm) by EQ-MRI measured ECV (ECVeq); and Bland-Altman agreement between measures was assessed. Results The fractional cellular volume measured by EQ-MRI (ECVeq) within the tumoroids ranged from 0.821 to 0.963. ECVeq was a good predictor of ECVm (R2 = 0.77, P = 0.02). The regression line Y-axis intercept (when X = 0) was 0.045 \u00b1 0.019 with a slope of 1.28 \u00b1 0.35. Bland-Altman comparison demonstrated 95% limits of agreement between -0.002 and 0.114 with a bias (SD) of 0.056 (0.03). Conclusion This study supports the principles of ECV estimation using equilibrium contrast MRI, but future development of this model may allow validation over a wider, more physiological ECV range and a greater understanding of the effect of tissue extracellular protein burden on ECV.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biological model", "contrast agents", "fibrosis", "magnetic resonance imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Line, Tumor", "Collagen", "Contrast Media", "Diffusion", "Gadolinium", "HT29 Cells", "Humans", "Hydrogels", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Least-Squares Analysis", "Linear Models", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Myocardium", "Regression Analysis", "Reproducibility of Results", "Tissue Engineering"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951090789", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35775945600": {"Name": "Bandula S.", "AuthorID": "35775945600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "20335768100": {"Name": "Stevens N.", "AuthorID": "20335768100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57014575700": {"Name": "Yeung J.", "AuthorID": "57014575700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "57015511600": {"Name": "Magdeldin T.", "AuthorID": "57015511600", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Repair and Engineering Centre, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science"}, "9238779300": {"Name": "Cheema U.", "AuthorID": "9238779300", "AffiliationID": "60176023", "AffiliationName": "Tissue Repair and Engineering Centre, Institute of Orthopaedics and Musculoskeletal Sciences, UCL Division of Surgery and Interventional Science"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}}}
