These distal networks recruit both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and result in divisive normalization. Normalization is traditionally thought to result from increases in synaptic inhibition. By combining optogenetic stimulation and intracellular recordings in mouse visual cortex, we found that, on the contrary, normalization is a result of a decrease in synaptic excitation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Nerve Net", "Optogenetics", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958064016", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"55922938200": {"Name": "Sato T.K.", "AuthorID": "55922938200", "AffiliationID": "60118102, 60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience, Technische Universitat M\u00fcnchen"}, "8682719000": {"Name": "Haider B.", "AuthorID": "8682719000", "AffiliationID": "60002339", "AffiliationName": "Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Emory University, School of Medicine"}, "6701363142": {"Name": "Carandini M.", "AuthorID": "6701363142", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7003425281": {"Name": "H\u00e4usser M.", "AuthorID": "7003425281", "AffiliationID": "60089914, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Institute for Biomedical Research, University College London"}}}
