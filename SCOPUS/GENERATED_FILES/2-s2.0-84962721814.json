During Polarstern Expedition PS87/2014, we discovered multiple submarine landslides along Lomonosov Ridge. Removal of younger sediments from steep headwalls has led to exhumation of Miocene sediments close to the seafloor. Here we document the presence of IP 25 as a proxy for spring sea-ice cover and alkenone-based summer sea-surface temperatures >4 \u00b0C that support a seasonal sea-ice cover with an ice-free summer season being predominant during the late Miocene in the central Arctic Ocean. A comparison of our proxy data with Miocene climate simulations seems to favour either relatively high late Miocene atmospheric CO 2 concentrations and/or a weak sensitivity of the model to simulate the magnitude of high-latitude warming in a warmer than modern climate.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962721814", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55510102000": {"Name": "Stein R.", "AuthorID": "55510102000", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences (FB5), University of Bremen"}, "55904472500": {"Name": "Fahl K.", "AuthorID": "55904472500", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research"}, "23034800100": {"Name": "Knorr G.", "AuthorID": "23034800100", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research"}, "7003698160": {"Name": "Niessen F.", "AuthorID": "7003698160", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research"}, "56249611100": {"Name": "Gebhardt C.", "AuthorID": "56249611100", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research"}, "57210830514": {"Name": "Jensen L.", "AuthorID": "57210830514", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research"}, "7004638808": {"Name": "Matthiessen J.", "AuthorID": "7004638808", "AffiliationID": "60023131", "AffiliationName": "Alfred Wegener Institute (AWI), Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research"}, "56962771100": {"Name": "Jokat W.", "AuthorID": "56962771100", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geosciences (FB5), University of Bremen"}, "7005978899": {"Name": "Lohmann G.", "AuthorID": "7005978899", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "MARUM-Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen"}, "15723922100": {"Name": "Kopf A.", "AuthorID": "15723922100", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "MARUM-Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen"}, "55428525000": {"Name": "Schreck M.", "AuthorID": "55428525000", "AffiliationID": "60080743", "AffiliationName": "Arctic Research Centre, Korea Polar Research Institute"}, "6507996981": {"Name": "Forwick M.", "AuthorID": "6507996981", "AffiliationID": "60021255", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Geology, University of Troms\u00f8, Arctic University of Norway"}, "7202547764": {"Name": "Kaminski M.", "AuthorID": "7202547764", "AffiliationID": "60009506", "AffiliationName": "Geosciences Department, College of Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals"}}}
