We define CPTP maps with equilibrium as CPTP maps with an invariant state such that the entropy production due to the action of the map on the invariant state vanishes. Thermal maps are a subgroup of CPTP maps with equilibrium. In general, for CPTP maps, the thermodynamic quantities, such as the entropy production or work performed on the system, depend on the combined state of the system plus its environment. We show that these quantities can be written in terms of system properties for maps with equilibrium. The relations that we obtain are valid for arbitrary coupling strengths between the system and the thermal bath. The fluctuations of thermodynamic quantities are considered in the framework of a two-point measurement scheme. We derive the entropy production fluctuation theorem for general maps and a fluctuation relation for the stochastic work on a system that starts in the Gibbs state. Some simplifications for the probability distributions in the case of maps with equilibrium are presented. We illustrate our results by considering spin 12 systems under thermal maps, nonthermal maps with equilibrium, maps with nonequilibrium steady states, and concatenations of them. Finally, and as an important application, we consider a particular limit in which the concatenation of maps generates a continuous time evolution in Lindblad form for the system of interest, and we show that the concept of maps with and without equilibrium translates into Lindblad equations with and without quantum detailed balance, respectively. The consequences for the thermodynamic quantities in this limit are discussed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Arbitrary couplings", "Completely positive", "Entropy production", "Fluctuation relations", "Fluctuation theorems", "Non-equilibrium steady state", "Stochastic thermodynamics", "Thermodynamic quantities"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034028473", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"6701322006": {"Name": "Barra F.", "AuthorID": "6701322006", "AffiliationID": "60122504, 60012464", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Facultad de Ciencias F\u00edsicas y Matem\u00e1ticas, Universidad de Chile"}, "57197711692": {"Name": "Lled\u00f3 C.", "AuthorID": "57197711692", "AffiliationID": "60122504, 60012464", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de F\u00edsica, Facultad de Ciencias F\u00edsicas y Matem\u00e1ticas, Universidad de Chile"}}}
