It carries high likelihood of unfavourable outcome and putative aetiology relates to an auto-inflammatory process. Standard antiepileptic drug therapies including intravenous anaesthetic agents are largely ineffective in controlling status epilepticus in FIRES. Deep brain stimulation of the centromedian thalamic nuclei (CMN-DBS) has been previously used in refractory status epilepticus in only a few cases. The use of Anakinra (a recombinant version of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) has been reported in one case with FIRES with good outcome. Here we describe two male paediatric patients with FIRES unresponsive to multiple anti-epileptic drugs, first-line immune modulation, ketogenic diet and cannabidiol. They both received Anakinra and underwent CMN-DBS. The primary aim for CMN-DBS therapy was to reduce generalized seizures. CMN-DBS abolished generalized seizures in both cases and Anakinra had a positive effect in one. This patient had a favourable outcome whereas the other did not. These are the first reported cases of FIRES where CMN-DBS has been used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anakinra", "Centromedian thalamic nuclei", "Deep brain stimulation", "FIRES"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Febrile Encephalopathy", "Anticonvulsants", "Child", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Drug Resistant Epilepsy", "Humans", "Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein", "Male", "Status Epilepticus", "Thalamic Nuclei", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070885399", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57202025889": {"Name": "Sa M.", "AuthorID": "57202025889", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "47961324500": {"Name": "Pujar S.", "AuthorID": "47961324500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "39862801800": {"Name": "Desai N.", "AuthorID": "39862801800", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "12769712600": {"Name": "Eltze C.", "AuthorID": "12769712600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences, University College London NIHR BRC Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "13609308000": {"Name": "Kaliakatsos M.", "AuthorID": "13609308000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57221126957": {"Name": "Singh R.", "AuthorID": "57221126957", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, King's College Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7005092859": {"Name": "Valentin A.", "AuthorID": "7005092859", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, King's College Hospital NHS Trust"}, "55520827500": {"Name": "D'Arco F.", "AuthorID": "55520827500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "21334732800": {"Name": "Hughes E.", "AuthorID": "21334732800", "AffiliationID": "60107269, 60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Evelina London Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56585821000": {"Name": "Al Obaidi M.", "AuthorID": "56585821000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "24757952100": {"Name": "Eleftheriou D.", "AuthorID": "24757952100", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Infection, Immunity and Rheumatology Section, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "16242763100": {"Name": "Tisdall M.", "AuthorID": "16242763100", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "6603305716": {"Name": "Selway R.", "AuthorID": "6603305716", "AffiliationID": "60029685", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, King's College Hospital NHS Trust"}}}
