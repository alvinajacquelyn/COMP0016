Typically, conditions of this sort are expressed in terms of integrability conditions (such as the well-known Novikov condition). The weak convergence approach that we propose allows to replace integrability conditions by a suitable tightness condition. We then provide several applications of this approach ranging from simplified proofs of classical results to characterizations of processes conditioned on first passage time events and changes of measures for jump processes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conditional queuing process", "existence of weak solution", "Girsanov theorem", "local martingale", "tightness"], "IndexKeywords": ["Existence of weak solutions", "First passage time", "Girsanov theorems", "Integrability", "local martingale", "Non negatives", "tightness", "Weak convergence"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951293657", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"14059644100": {"Name": "Blanchet J.", "AuthorID": "14059644100", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of IEOR and Department of Statistics, Columbia University"}, "55390112700": {"Name": "Ruf J.", "AuthorID": "55390112700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
