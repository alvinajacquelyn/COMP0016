American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Silicon and oxygen are potential light elements in Earth's core because their stronger affinity to metal observed with increasing temperature posits that significant amounts of both can be incorporated into the core. It was proposed that an Fe\u2013Si\u2013O liquid alloy could expel SiO2 at the core-mantle boundary during secular cooling, leaving the core with either silicon or oxygen, not both. This was recently challenged in a study showing no exsolution but immiscibility in the Fe\u2013Si\u2013O system. Here we investigate the liquidus field of Fe\u2013Si and Fe\u2013O binaries and Fe\u2013Si\u2013O ternaries at core-mantle boundary pressures and temperatures using ab initio molecular dynamics. We find that the liquids remain well mixed with ternary properties identical to mixing of binary properties. Two-phase simulations of solid SiO2 and liquid Fe show dissolution at temperatures above 4100 K, suggesting that SiO2 crystallization as well as liquid immiscibility in Fe\u2013Si\u2013O is unlikely to occur in Earth's core.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ab initio molecular dynamics", "Core-mantle boundary", "Earth's core", "Increasing temperatures", "Light elements", "Liquid alloy", "Liquid immiscibility", "Two-phase simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85068038874", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (all)", "EART", "1900"]], "AuthorData": {"57204125995": {"Name": "Huang D.", "AuthorID": "57204125995", "AffiliationID": "60001970", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, 75005"}, "6603780100": {"Name": "Badro J.", "AuthorID": "6603780100", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne"}, "7004463552": {"Name": "Brodholt J.", "AuthorID": "7004463552", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "55588581000": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "55588581000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}}}
