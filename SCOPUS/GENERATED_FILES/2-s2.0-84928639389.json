In this paper, we propose a cross-layer design (CLD) of carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism at the medium access control (MAC) layer with spectrum sensing (SpSe) at the physical layer, for identifying the occupancy status of TV bands. The proposed CLD relies on a Markov chain model with a state pair containing both the SpSe and the CSMA/CA from which we derive the collision probability and the achievable throughput. Analytical and simulation results are obtained for different collision avoidance and SpSe implementation scenarios by varying the contention window, back off stage and probability of detection. The obtained results depict the achievable throughput under different collision avoidance and SpSe implementation scenarios indicating thereby the performance of collision avoidance in TVWSs-based CRNs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance", "cognitive radio networks", "collision avoidance", "cross-layer design", "Markov's chain", "spectrum sensing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Achievable throughputs", "Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidances", "Cognitive radio network", "Cognitive radio networks (CRNs)", "Cross-layer design", "Medium access control layer", "Probability of detection", "Spectrum sensing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928639389", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55952568500": {"Name": "Foukalas F.", "AuthorID": "55952568500", "AffiliationID": "60028900", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University of Athens"}, "6601990159": {"Name": "Karetsos G.", "AuthorID": "6601990159", "AffiliationID": "60028319", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Engineering, Technology Education Institute of Thessaly"}}}
