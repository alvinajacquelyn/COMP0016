As crucial players in establishment of the pre-metastatic niche, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) release S100A8/A9, an exosomal protein that contributes to metastasis, angiogenesis, and immune suppression. We report the application of antibody-based single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of S100A8/A9 in vivo as an imaging marker for pre-metastatic tissue priming. Methods A syngeneic model system for invasive breast cancer with (4T1.2) or without (67NR) the tendency to form lung metastasis was established in BALB/c mice. A SPECT-probe has been generated and tested for visualization of S100A9 release. Tumor-associated changes in numbers and fuction of immune cells in pre-metastatic tissue were evaluated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Results S100A8/A9 imaging reflected MDSC abundance and the establishment of an immunosuppressive environment in pre-metastatic lung tissue (activity 4T1.2 vs. healthy control: 0.95 vs. 0.45 %ID; p < 0 .001). The S100A8/A9 imaging signal in the pre-metastatic lung correlated with the subsequent metastatic tumor burden in the same organ (r2=0.788; p < 0.0001). CCL2 blockade and the consecutive inhibition of premetastatic niche establishment was clearly depicted by S100A9-SPECT (lung activity untreated vs. treated: 2 vs, 1.4 %ID). Conclusion We report S100A8/A9 as a potent imaging biomarker for tumor-mediated immune remodeling with potential applications in basic research and clinical oncology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Imaging", "MDSC", "Premetastatic niche", "Tumour immunology"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Breast Neoplasms", "Calgranulin A", "Calgranulin B", "Disease Models, Animal", "Flow Cytometry", "Lung Neoplasms", "Mice, Inbred BALB C", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Neoplasm Metastasis", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021251016", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (miscellaneous)", "PHAR", "3001"]], "AuthorData": {"56600873500": {"Name": "Eisenblaetter M.", "AuthorID": "56600873500", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Radiology, University Hospital Muenster"}, "10046319100": {"Name": "Flores-Borja F.", "AuthorID": "10046319100", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Now Research Unit, Department of Research Oncology, Guy's Hospital, King's College London"}, "57194612842": {"Name": "Lee J.J.", "AuthorID": "57194612842", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Now Research Unit, Department of Research Oncology, Guy's Hospital, King's College London"}, "56545696500": {"Name": "Wefers C.", "AuthorID": "56545696500", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Richard Dimbleby Department of Cancer Research, Randall Division and Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "57194613229": {"Name": "Smith H.", "AuthorID": "57194613229", "AffiliationID": "60177635, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Richard Dimbleby Department of Cancer Research, Randall Division and Division of Cancer Studies, King's College London"}, "7402229941": {"Name": "Ng T.", "AuthorID": "7402229941", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, University College London"}, "25223252300": {"Name": "Hueting R.", "AuthorID": "25223252300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "8326024200": {"Name": "Cooper M.S.", "AuthorID": "8326024200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "7006323953": {"Name": "Blower P.J.", "AuthorID": "7006323953", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "56821457500": {"Name": "Schaeffter T.", "AuthorID": "56821457500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London"}, "7003428170": {"Name": "Tutt A.", "AuthorID": "7003428170", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "Breast Cancer Now Research Unit, Department of Research Oncology, Guy's Hospital, King's College London"}, "57190090842": {"Name": "Patel D.", "AuthorID": "57190090842", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London"}, "22036034000": {"Name": "Rodriguez-Justo M.", "AuthorID": "22036034000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Histopathology, University College London"}, "54414553900": {"Name": "Milewicz H.", "AuthorID": "54414553900", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, Paul O'Gorman Building, University College London"}, "35444602000": {"Name": "Vogl T.", "AuthorID": "35444602000", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Muenster"}, "7404379084": {"Name": "Roth J.", "AuthorID": "7404379084", "AffiliationID": "60006490", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Muenster"}}}
