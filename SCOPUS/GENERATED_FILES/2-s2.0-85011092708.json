In this review, we show that not only do many studies support this model, but also that more specific models of PFC development can be formulated, according to the functional roles of subregions and by taking into account the distinctions within ventral\u2013dorsal and lateral\u2013medial PFC. We also reveal that the functional development of dorsolateral PFC supports the development of deliberative processes, whereas that of the medial PFC supports the development of internalized decisions. These new conceptualizations may provide better descriptions of the complexity of cognitive control development.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cognitive control", "Deliberative process", "nocv1", "Prefrontal cortex", "Rule based", "Young children", "Adolescent", "Cognition", "Humans", "Learning", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Prefrontal Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011092708", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"7004062158": {"Name": "Crone E.A.", "AuthorID": "7004062158", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Psychology, Leiden University"}, "14621701400": {"Name": "Steinbeis N.", "AuthorID": "14621701400", "AffiliationID": "60019816", "AffiliationName": "Department of Developmental Psychology, Leiden University"}}}
