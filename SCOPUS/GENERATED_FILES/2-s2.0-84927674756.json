Here, vaccinia virus (VACV) protein N1 is shown to impair the development of both effector and memory CD8+ T cells and this correlates with its inhibition of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation. Infection with VACVs that either have the N1L gene deleted (v\u0394N1) or contain a I6E mutation (vN1.I6E) that abrogates its inhibition of NF-\u03baB resulted in increased central and memory CD8+ T-cell populations, increased CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity and lower virus titres after challenge. Furthermore, CD8+ memory T-cell function was increased following infection with vN1.I6E, with more interferon-\u03b3 production and greater protection against VACV infection following passive transfer to naive mice, compared with CD8+ T cells from mice infected with wild-type virus (vN1.WT). This demonstrates the importance of NF-\u03baB activation within infected cells for long-term CD8+ T-cell memory and vaccine efficacy. Further, it provides a rationale for deleting N1 from VACV vectors to enhance CD8+ T-cell immunogenicity, while simultaneously reducing virulence to improve vaccine safety.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD8+ T-cell memory", "N1L gene", "Nuclear factor-\u03baB inhibitor", "Vaccination", "Vaccinia virus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Proliferation", "Female", "Immunologic Memory", "Mice", "Mutation, Missense", "NF-kappa B", "Vaccinia", "Vaccinia virus", "Viral Proteins", "Viral Vaccines"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927674756", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"7202793976": {"Name": "Ren H.", "AuthorID": "7202793976", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "16318489300": {"Name": "Ferguson B.J.", "AuthorID": "16318489300", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "Department of Microbial and Cellular Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "23989078400": {"Name": "de Motes C.M.", "AuthorID": "23989078400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "53868481600": {"Name": "Sumner R.P.", "AuthorID": "53868481600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "56458219000": {"Name": "Harman L.E.R.", "AuthorID": "56458219000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}, "56416777400": {"Name": "Smith G.L.", "AuthorID": "56416777400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge"}}}
