One popular method, known as maximally informative dimensions (MID), uses an information-theoretic quantity known as \u201csingle-spike information\u201d to identify this space. Here we examine MID from a model-based perspective. We show that MID is a maximum-likelihood estimator for the parameters of a linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model, and that the empirical single-spike information corresponds to the normalized log-likelihood under a Poisson model. This equivalence implies that MID does not necessarily find maximally informative stimulus dimensions when spiking is not well described as Poisson. We provide several examples to illustrate this shortcoming, and derive a lower bound on the information lost when spiking is Bernoulli in discrete time bins. To overcome this limitation, we introduce model-based dimensionality reduction methods for neurons with non-Poisson firing statistics, and show that they can be framed equivalently in likelihood-based or information-theoretic terms. Finally, we show how to overcome practical limitations on the number of stimulus dimensions that MID can estimate by constraining the form of the non-parametric nonlinearity in an LNP model. We illustrate these methods with simulations and data from primate visual cortex.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Computer Simulation", "Humans", "Information Theory", "Likelihood Functions", "Models, Neurological", "Models, Statistical", "Neurons", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929493554", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"56647482400": {"Name": "Williamson R.S.", "AuthorID": "56647482400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "7005205264": {"Name": "Sahani M.", "AuthorID": "7005205264", "AffiliationID": "60084280, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London"}, "7003670493": {"Name": "Pillow J.W.", "AuthorID": "7003670493", "AffiliationID": "60003269", "AffiliationName": "Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Department of Psychology, Princeton University"}}}
