In this paper, a mask-assisted dual-chemical-processing approach without special modification is used to prepare the extreme wettability patterns on various metal substrates. Fabrication of superhydrophilic-superhydrophobic patterns on five kinds of metal substrates of Al, Ti, steel, Zn and Mg alloy proved the versatility of this method. The extreme wettability patterns prepared by this method were applied to fog harvest and we found the big differences in the collection efficiency of various metal surface patterns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Extreme wettability", "Fog harvest", "Universal method", "Various metal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical processing", "Collection efficiency", "Metal substrate", "Metal surfaces", "Super-hydrophilic", "Superhydrophobic", "Surface pattern", "Universal method"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054069000", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Colloid and Surface Chemistry", "CENG", "1505"]], "AuthorData": {"55547135326": {"Name": "Sun J.", "AuthorID": "55547135326", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57204024345": {"Name": "Chen C.", "AuthorID": "57204024345", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "37077947000": {"Name": "Song J.", "AuthorID": "37077947000", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57196289790": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "57196289790", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "55924108500": {"Name": "Yang X.", "AuthorID": "55924108500", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57132535300": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "57132535300", "AffiliationID": "60004538, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory for Precision and Non-traditional Machining Technology of the Ministry of Education, Dalian University of Technology"}, "56175536900": {"Name": "Liu X.", "AuthorID": "56175536900", "AffiliationID": "60004538", "AffiliationName": "Collaborative Innovation Center of Major Machine Manufacturing in Liaoning, Dalian University of Technology"}, "57206597914": {"Name": "Lu Y.", "AuthorID": "57206597914", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}}}
