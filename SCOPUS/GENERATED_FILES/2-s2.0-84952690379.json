All rights reserved.Objective The caudal zona incerta (cZI) is a promising, clinically beneficial target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson s disease (PD). To assess whether DBS of the cZI affects the rate of dopamine terminal dysfunction, PD patients with and without DBS were followed prospectively with 123I FP-Cit single photon emission tomography from the first diagnosis and up to 8 years. Methods Six patients underwent DBS of the cZI during the survey period. Twenty-two PD patients only on pharmacotherapy served as controls. 123I FP-Cit and clinical assessment were performed at baseline and after 1, 3 and 5 years in all patients. Ten patients also underwent a 123I FPCit after 8 years. Image data were evaluated semiquantitatively. Mixed-model analysis was used to assess the relative change in 123I FP-Cit uptake and comparison between surgically and conservatively treated PD patients. Results The relative decrease in 123I FP-Cit uptake was more pronounced in DBS-treated patients than in controls in the more affected caudate (P=0.037) and putamen (P=0.013). The annual decrease rates were higher in the less affected than the more affected putamen, and were slightly greater in DBS-treated patients (4.8%, 95% confidence interval: 8.5 2.2%) than in controls (4.0%, 95% confidence interval: 5.1 3.1%). Conclusion This long-term prospective study confirms that the underlying dopaminergic dysfunction continues despite clinical improvement in PD patients with DBS of the cZI. A slightly faster rate of decrease in 123I FP-Cit uptake in these patients compared with conservatively treated PD patients may reflect a more aggressive form of PD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "dopamine transporter", "Parkinson disease", "single photon emission computed tomography", "zona incerta"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Deep Brain Stimulation", "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Molecular Imaging", "Parkinson Disease", "Protein Transport", "Time Factors", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon", "Zona Incerta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952690379", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"35789100800": {"Name": "Mo S.", "AuthorID": "35789100800", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Radiation Sciences, Diagnostic Radiology, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "35332326400": {"Name": "Linder J.", "AuthorID": "35332326400", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "55928136000": {"Name": "Blomstedt P.", "AuthorID": "55928136000", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7004808993": {"Name": "Forsgren L.", "AuthorID": "7004808993", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Unit of Functional Neurosurgery, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35766398300": {"Name": "Gran\u00e5sen G.", "AuthorID": "35766398300", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Epidemiology and Global Health, Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University"}}}
