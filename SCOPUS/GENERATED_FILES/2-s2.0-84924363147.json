Details of the proposed procedure are presented in a flow chart showing the key subtasks. The applicability of the method is demonstrated using an example of a hypothetical LNG FPSO operating in a natural gas site off a hypothetical oceanic region. It is noted that the proposed method is still under development for determining reliable estimates of extreme sloshing induced impact loads. It is concluded that the developed method is useful for determining the sloshing design loads in ship-shaped offshore LNG installations in combination with virtual metocean data and operational conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Floating production , storage , and offloading", "Impact loads", "Nominal values", "Oceanic regions", "Operational conditions", "Probabilistic approaches", "Reliable estimates", "Tank sloshing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924363147", "SubjectAreas": [["Ocean Engineering", "ENGI", "2212"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.K.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence, Pusan National University"}, "56128386200": {"Name": "Lee S.E.", "AuthorID": "56128386200", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence, Pusan National University"}, "23009087100": {"Name": "Kim B.J.", "AuthorID": "23009087100", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence, Pusan National University"}, "36890591400": {"Name": "Seo J.K.", "AuthorID": "36890591400", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence, Pusan National University"}, "37097077300": {"Name": "Ha Y.C.", "AuthorID": "37097077300", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute, The Lloyd's Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence, Pusan National University"}, "55533714400": {"Name": "Matsumoto T.", "AuthorID": "55533714400", "AffiliationID": "60015231", "AffiliationName": "Nippon Kaiji Kyokai"}, "56542943300": {"Name": "Byeon S.H.", "AuthorID": "56542943300", "AffiliationID": "112978789", "AffiliationName": "STX Offshore and Shipbuilding Co., Ltd."}}}
