The Repetitive Behaviour Questionnaire was administered to caregivers of adults with Williams (n = 96), Prader\u2013Willi (n = 103) and Down (n = 78) syndromes. There were few group differences, although participants with Williams syndrome were more likely to show body stereotypies. Individuals with Williams syndrome also showed more hoarding and less tidying behaviours than those with Down syndrome. IQ and adaptive ability were negatively associated with repetitive questioning in people with Williams syndrome. The profile of repetitive behaviour amongst individuals with Williams syndrome was similar to the comparison syndromes. The cognitive mechanisms underlying these behaviours in genetic syndromes warrant further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Down syndrome", "Prader\u2013Willi syndrome", "Repetitive behaviour", "Williams syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Caregivers", "Cognition", "Down Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prader-Willi Syndrome", "Stereotyped Behavior", "Stereotypic Movement Disorder", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Williams Syndrome", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030540540", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"57191361060": {"Name": "Royston R.", "AuthorID": "57191361060", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "57203219218": {"Name": "Oliver C.", "AuthorID": "57203219218", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "25652154200": {"Name": "Moss J.", "AuthorID": "25652154200", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "23979147800": {"Name": "Adams D.", "AuthorID": "23979147800", "AffiliationID": "60032987", "AffiliationName": "Griffith University"}, "56601719400": {"Name": "Berg K.", "AuthorID": "56601719400", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of East London"}, "25651723500": {"Name": "Burbidge C.", "AuthorID": "25651723500", "AffiliationID": "60101776", "AffiliationName": "Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust"}, "57196590272": {"Name": "Nelson L.", "AuthorID": "57196590272", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "24781337600": {"Name": "Stinton C.", "AuthorID": "24781337600", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "University of Warwick"}, "56443617600": {"Name": "Waite J.", "AuthorID": "56443617600", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Birmingham"}, "7006180876": {"Name": "Howlin P.", "AuthorID": "7006180876", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "University of Sydney"}}}
