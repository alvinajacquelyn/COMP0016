The sites are located at mid-elevation (c. 650\u20131400 m above sea level) in a mosaic landscape showing anthropogenic open habitats and plantations as well as some evergreen forests. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the landscape composition of grassland and forest over time in the region, grassland being invariably shaped by anthropogenic activities, particularly fire for cultivation. We identified and classified phytoliths into 34 morphotypes from five taxonomic groups: Poaceae (grasses), Cyperaceae (sedges), Arecaceae (palms), Pteridopsida (ferns) and woody dicotyledons (broad-leaved trees and shrubs). We also calculated the humidity\u2013aridity index (Iph). First, our results show that grasses are the most represented phytolith types in both sites, followed by broad-leaved trees and shrubs, palms, sedges, and ferns. Second, the highly variable climatic index Iph over the last 1000 years suggest that changes in phytolith percentage (e.g. broad-leaved trees) might be caused by human agro-pastoral activities, such as clearing through fires and irrigation. Prior to these human activities, the phytolith signal for early Holocene climate is congruent with the existing literature. Finally, this study compares new phytolith results with previous pollen data from the same sites. We find good agreement between these two botanical proxies throughout, thus validating our findings. We provide important evidence regarding the history of environmental change due to anthropogenic activities in the Western Ghats. This has important implications because it provides insights into how tropical forest will respond to increased intensity of human activities.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Holocene", "Land-use change", "Local dynamics", "Phytoliths", "Tropical forest", "Western Ghats"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84960830576", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"24344354300": {"Name": "Nogu\u00e9 S.", "AuthorID": "24344354300", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Geography and Environment, University of Southampton"}, "57168886400": {"Name": "Whicher K.", "AuthorID": "57168886400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Long-Term Ecology Laboratory, Biodiversity Institute, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford"}, "55543671000": {"Name": "Baker A.", "AuthorID": "55543671000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "56207846800": {"Name": "Bhagwat S.", "AuthorID": "56207846800", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, The Open University"}, "57203056321": {"Name": "Willis K.", "AuthorID": "57203056321", "AffiliationID": "60000345", "AffiliationName": "Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew"}}}
