Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A qualitative approach comprising a literature review, a case study of Webbs on the Web, a summary and analysis of the results of user testing and a critical analysis of the collaboration itself. Findings \u2013 A deeper understanding of the complementary skills of library professionals and DH researchers and how they may best be utilised in digital library development will lead, ceteris paribus, to richer and more fit-for-purpose digital scholarly resources. This is exemplified by Webbs on the Web, where the unique but complementary perspectives that such groups brought to user testing enhanced the usability of the resource for a wide range of audiences. Furthermore, the kinds of collaborations that characterised this project reflect broader changes in academic communities and digital library development, and a host of mutually beneficial outcomes can be pursued as a result of such changes. Originality/value \u2013 We demonstrate the benefits that can flow from breaking down boundaries and hierarchies between the academic library professional and DH researcher. We advance the current literature by providing concrete examples of practice; much of the current literature tends to be more abstract in nature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaboration", "Digital humanities", "Digital libraries", "Digital scholarly resources", "Librarianship", "User studies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923278660", "SubjectAreas": [["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"56525074400": {"Name": "Fay E.", "AuthorID": "56525074400", "AffiliationID": "113552571", "AffiliationName": "Open Planets Foundation"}, "56173511400": {"Name": "Nyhan J.", "AuthorID": "56173511400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
