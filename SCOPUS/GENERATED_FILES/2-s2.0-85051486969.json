Mobile phones, smart watches, and wearable activity trackers (WATs) are just some of the technologies that are guiding, nudging, monitoring, and reminding individuals in their day-to-day lives. These devices are designed to enhance and support their human users, however, there is a lack of attention to the unintended consequences, the technology non-neutrality and the darker sides of becoming human-tech hybrids. Using the extended mind theory (EMT) and agential intra-action, we aimed at exploring how human-tech hybrids gain collective skills and how these are put to use; how agency is expressed and how this affects the interactions; and what the darker sides are of being a human-tech hybrid. Using a qualitative method, we analyzed the experiences of using a WAT, with a specific focus on how the tracker and the individual solve tasks, share competences, develop new skills, and negotiate for agency and autonomy. We contributed with new insight on human-tech hybridity and presented a concept referred to as the agency pendulum, reflecting the dynamism of agency. Finally, we demonstrated how the EMT and agential intra-action as a combined theoretical lens can be used to explore human-tech hybridity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agency", "Agential intra-action", "Extended mind", "Hybridity", "Wearable activity trackers"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051486969", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"56406415100": {"Name": "Duus R.", "AuthorID": "56406415100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, University College London"}, "57203385148": {"Name": "Cooray M.", "AuthorID": "57203385148", "AffiliationID": "60108746", "AffiliationName": "Hult International Business School"}, "56340774900": {"Name": "Page N.", "AuthorID": "56340774900", "AffiliationID": "60108746", "AffiliationName": "Hult International Business School"}}}
