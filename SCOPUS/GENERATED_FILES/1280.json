The toolkit provides the option of execution on fast graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware, numerous constitutive models and solid-element options, membrane and shell elements, and contact modelling facilities, in a simple to use library. Methods: The toolkit is founded on the total Lagrangian explicit dynamics (TLEDs) algorithm, which has been shown to be efficient and accurate for simulation of soft tissues. The base code is written in C$$++$$++, and GPU execution is achieved using the nVidia CUDA framework. In most cases, interaction with the underlying solvers can be achieved through a single Simulator class, which may be embedded directly in third-party applications such as, surgical guidance systems. Advanced capabilities such as contact modelling and nonlinear constitutive models are also provided, as are more experimental technologies like reduced order modelling. A consistent description of the underlying solution algorithm, its implementation with a focus on GPU execution, and examples of the toolkit\u2019s usage in biomedical applications are provided. Results: Efficient mapping of the TLED algorithm to parallel hardware results in very high computational performance, far exceeding that available in commercial packages. Conclusion: The NiftySim toolkit provides high-performance soft tissue simulation capabilities using GPU technology for biomechanical simulation research applications in medical image computing, surgical simulation, and surgical guidance applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["FEM", "GPU", "Soft tissue biomechanics", "Software engineering", "Total Lagrangian explicit dynamics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Computer Simulation", "Computing Methodologies", "Humans", "Models, Theoretical", "Nonlinear Dynamics", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934438455", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computer Graphics and Computer-Aided Design", "COMP", "1704"]], "AuthorData": {"55199206700": {"Name": "Johnsen S.F.", "AuthorID": "55199206700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7006920406": {"Name": "Clarkson M.J.", "AuthorID": "7006920406", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602192523": {"Name": "Hipwell J.", "AuthorID": "6602192523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "42361164100": {"Name": "Eiben B.", "AuthorID": "42361164100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "55823389000": {"Name": "Han L.", "AuthorID": "55823389000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "24512208500": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "24512208500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36172530200": {"Name": "Mertzanidou T.", "AuthorID": "36172530200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.J.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "23398817700": {"Name": "Taylor Z.A.", "AuthorID": "23398817700", "AffiliationID": "60001881, 60183164", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, CISTIB Centre for Computational Imaging and Simulation Technologies in Biomedicine, Insigneo Institute for in silico Medicine, The University of Sheffield"}}}
