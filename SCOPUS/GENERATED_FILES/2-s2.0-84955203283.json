Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.The activity of HBF4 (aqueous solution) as a catalyst in propargylation reactions is presented. Diverse types of nucleophiles were employed in order to form new C-O, C-N and C-C bonds in technical acetone and in air. Good to excellent yields and good chemoselectivities were obtained using low acid loading (typically 1 mol-%) under simple reaction conditions. The activity of HBF4 (aq. solution) as a catalyst in propargylation reactions is presented. C-O, C-N and C-C bonds were formed in technical acetone and in air. Good to excellent yields were obtained using low acid loading (typically 1 mol-%) under mild reaction conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Br\u00f8nsted acid", "Friedel-Crafts reaction", "Homogeneous catalysis", "Nucleophilic substitution", "Propargylic alcohols"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955203283", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"8419710500": {"Name": "Barreiro E.", "AuthorID": "8419710500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London Exhibition Road"}, "56993732000": {"Name": "Sanz-Vidal A.", "AuthorID": "56993732000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London Exhibition Road"}, "56992143100": {"Name": "Tan E.", "AuthorID": "56992143100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London Exhibition Road"}, "56709206700": {"Name": "Lau S.", "AuthorID": "56709206700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London Exhibition Road"}, "15759398200": {"Name": "D\u00edez-Gonz\u00e1lez S.", "AuthorID": "15759398200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London Exhibition Road"}, "7006813758": {"Name": "Sheppard T.", "AuthorID": "7006813758", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London, Christopher Ingold Laboratories"}}}
