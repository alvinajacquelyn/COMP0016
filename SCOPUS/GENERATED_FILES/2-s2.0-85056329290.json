In this work, the fabrication of poly(sarcosine)-based diblock copolymer nano-objects with various morphologies via aqueous reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT)-mediated photoinitiated polymerization-induced self-assembly (photo-PISA) is reported. Poly(sarcosine) was first synthesized via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of sarcosine N-carboxyanhydride, using high-vacuum techniques. A small molecule chain transfer agent (CTA) was then coupled to the active \u03c9-amino chain end of the telechelic polymer for the synthesis of a poly(sarcosine)-based macro-CTA. Controlled chain-extensions of a commercially available water-miscible methacrylate monomer (2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate) were achieved via photo-PISA under mild reaction conditions, using PSar macro-CTA. Upon varying the degree of polymerization and concentration of the core-forming monomer, morphologies evolving from spherical micelles to worm-like micelles and vesicles were accessed, as determined by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy, resulting in the construction of a detailed phase diagram. The resistance of both colloidally stable empty vesicles and enzyme-loaded nanoreactors against degradation by a series of proteases was finally assessed. Overall, our findings underline the potential of poly(sarcosine) as an alternative corona-forming polymer to poly(ethylene glycol)-based analogues of PISA assemblies for use in various pharmaceutical and biomedical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amphiphilic block copolymers", "Biomedical applications", "Degree of polymerization", "Methacrylate monomers", "Mild reaction conditions", "Photo-initiated polymerizations", "Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer", "Telechelic polymers", "Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic", "Horseradish Peroxidase", "Nanostructures", "Peptide Hydrolases", "Photochemical Processes", "Polymerization", "Polymers", "Sarcosine", "Surface Properties", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056329290", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Polymers and Plastics", "MATE", "2507"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"57113719900": {"Name": "Varlas S.", "AuthorID": "57113719900", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "57204607478": {"Name": "Georgiou P.G.", "AuthorID": "57204607478", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}, "57195761407": {"Name": "Jones J.R.", "AuthorID": "57195761407", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "57204851443": {"Name": "O'Reilly R.K.", "AuthorID": "57204851443", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham"}, "11139880300": {"Name": "Bilalis P.", "AuthorID": "11139880300", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences and Engineering Division, KAUST Catalysis Center, Polymer Synthesis Laboratory, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "24555620500": {"Name": "Hadjichristidis N.", "AuthorID": "24555620500", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Physical Sciences and Engineering Division, KAUST Catalysis Center, Polymer Synthesis Laboratory, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}}}
