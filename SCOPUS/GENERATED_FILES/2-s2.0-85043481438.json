The incidence of CVH is rising rapidly due to increasing laparotomy rates in ever older, obese and co-morbid patients. Surgeons with a specific interest in CVH repair are now frequently referring these patients for imaging, normally computed tomography scanning. This review describes what information is required from preoperative imaging and the surgical options and techniques used for CVH repair, so that radiologists understand the postoperative appearances specific to CVH and are aware of the common complications following surgery. Key Points: \u2022 Complex ventral hernia (CVH) describes large abdominal wall hernias (e.g. width \u226510cm). \u2022 CVH patients are being referred increasingly for preoperative and postoperative imaging. \u2022 Imaging is pivotal to characterise preoperative morphology and quantify loss of domain. \u2022 Postoperative imaging appearances are contingent on the surgical methods used for CVH repair. \u2022 Postoperative complications are depicted easily by imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abdominal Wall", "Hernia, Abdominal", "Hernia, Ventral", "Incisional Hernia", "Tomography, Spiral Computed"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abdominal Wall", "Female", "Hernia, Ventral", "Herniorrhaphy", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Care", "Postoperative Complications", "Preoperative Care", "Recurrence", "Surgical Mesh", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043481438", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55642708000": {"Name": "Halligan S.", "AuthorID": "55642708000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "14834275900": {"Name": "Plumb A.A.", "AuthorID": "14834275900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55345971100": {"Name": "Parker S.G.", "AuthorID": "55345971100", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "The Abdominal Wall Unit, Department of Surgery, University College Hospital"}, "7007026011": {"Name": "Windsor A.C.J.", "AuthorID": "7007026011", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "The Abdominal Wall Unit, Department of Surgery, University College Hospital"}}}
