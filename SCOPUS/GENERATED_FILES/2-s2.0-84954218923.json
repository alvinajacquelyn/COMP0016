Drawing on a range of international literature, the article explores the concepts of \u2018restrictive\u2019 and \u2018expansive\u2019 policy learning and develops a framework of dimensions for examining what is taking place across the UK at a time of change for all four national USE systems. From an examination of recent national policy literatures and interviews with key policy actors within the \u2018UK laboratory\u2019, we found that the conditions for expansive policy learning had markedly deteriorated due to \u2018accelerating divergence\u2019 between the three smaller countries and a dominant England that has been pursuing an \u2018extreme Anglo Saxon education model\u2019. The article also notes that some aspects of policy learning continue to take place \u2018beneath the radar\u2019 between UK and wide civil society organisations. This activity is more prevalent across the three smaller countries although each, to differing degrees, is still constrained by its position in relation to the UK as a whole.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anglo-Saxon education model", "Policy learning", "United Kingdom", "upper secondary education"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954218923", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"8147973500": {"Name": "Hodgson A.", "AuthorID": "8147973500", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}, "6603348633": {"Name": "Spours K.", "AuthorID": "6603348633", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
