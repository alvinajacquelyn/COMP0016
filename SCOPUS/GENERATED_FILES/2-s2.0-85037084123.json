Twin studies have established that both genes and environment play important roles in shaping food preferences; but the aetiology of variation in non-Alcoholic beverage preferences is unknown. 2865 adolescent twins (18-19-years old) from the Twins Early Development Study were used to quantify genetic and environmental influence on variation in liking for seven non-Alcoholic beverages: SSBs; NNSBs; fruit cordials, orange juice, milk, coffee, and tea. Maximum Likelihood Structural Equation Modelling established that beverage preferences have a moderate to low genetic basis; from 18% (95% CI: 10%, 25%) for orange juice to 42% (36%, 43%) for fruit cordials. Aspects of the environment that are not shared by twin pairs explained all remaining variance in drink preferences. The sizeable unique environmental influence on beverage preferences highlights the potential for environmental modification. Policies and guidelines to change preferences for unhealthy beverages may therefore be best directed at the wider environment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Beverages", "Diet", "Energy Intake", "Environment", "Family", "Female", "Food Preferences", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Humans", "Likelihood Functions", "Male", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Twins, Dizygotic", "Twins, Monozygotic", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037084123", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57190487769": {"Name": "Smith A.D.", "AuthorID": "57190487769", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "54414058400": {"Name": "Fildes A.", "AuthorID": "54414058400", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Leeds"}, "7006351296": {"Name": "Cooke L.", "AuthorID": "7006351296", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital, Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "24471042200": {"Name": "Llewellyn C.", "AuthorID": "24471042200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "8617731000": {"Name": "Forwood S.", "AuthorID": "8617731000", "AffiliationID": "60000913", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, Anglia Ruskin University"}}}
