Despite identifying genetic variants for many conditions, they have been criticized for yielding data with minimal clinical utility. However, in this regard, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common form of blindness in the Western world, is a striking exception. Through GWAS, common genetic variants at a number of loci have been discovered. Two loci in particular, including genes of the complement cascade on chromosome 1 and the ARMS2/HTRA1 genes on chromosome 10, have been shown to convey significantly increased susceptibility to developing AMD. Today, although it is possible to screen individuals for a genetic predisposition to the disease, effective interventional strategies for those at risk of developing AMD are scarce. Ongoing research in this area is nonetheless promising. After providing brief overviews of AMD and common disease genetics, we outline the main recent advances in the understanding of AMD, particularly those made through GWAS. Finally, the true merit of these findings and their current and potential translational value is examined.Genet Med 18 4, 283-289.", "AuthorKeywords": ["age-related macular degeneration", "complement cascade", "genome-wide association studies", "novel therapeutics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genome-Wide Association Study", "Humans", "Inheritance Patterns", "Macular Degeneration", "Mutation", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Translational Medical Research"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84962374584", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"57169443100": {"Name": "Black J.", "AuthorID": "57169443100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, Sir Alexander Fleming Building, Imperial College London"}, "55553497000": {"Name": "Clark S.", "AuthorID": "55553497000", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, Institute of Human Development, University of Manchester"}}}
