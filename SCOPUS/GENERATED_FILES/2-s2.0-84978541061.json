AIH-induced spinal plasticity is inhibited by systemic inflammation in animal models. Since SCI is frequently associated with systemic inflammation in humans, we tested the hypothesis that pretreatment with the anti-inflammatory agent ibuprofen enhances the effects of AIH. Methods: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover design was used. Nine adults (mean age 51.1 \u00b1 13.1 years) with chronic motor-incomplete SCI (7.7 \u00b1 6.3 years post-injury) received a single dose of ibuprofen (800 mg) or placebo, 90 minutes prior to AIH. For AIH, 9% O2 for 90 seconds was interspersed with 21% O2 for 60 seconds. Maximal voluntary ankle plantar flexion isometric torque was assessed prior to, and at 0, 30, and 60 minutes post-AIH. Surface electromyography (EMG) of plantar flexor muscles was also recorded. Results: Torque increased significantly after AIH at 30 (P = 0.007; by \u223c20%) and 60 (P < 0.001; by \u223c30%) minutes post-AIH versus baseline. Ibuprofen did not augment the effects of AIH. EMG activity did not increase significantly after AIH; however, there was a significant association between increases in torque and EMG in both gastrocnemius (R2 = 0.17, P < 0.005) and soleus (R2 = 0.17, P < 0.005) muscles. Conclusions: AIH systematically increased lower extremity torque in individuals with chronic incomplete SCI, but there was no significant effect of ibuprofen pretreatment. Our study re-confirms the ability of AIH to enhance leg strength in persons with chronic incomplete SCI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Humans", "Hypoxia", "Ibuprofen", "Muscle strength dynamometer", "Neuronal plasticity", "Rehabilitation", "Spinal cord injury"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Analgesics, Non-Narcotic", "Female", "Humans", "Ibuprofen", "Isometric Contraction", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Oxygen", "Oxygen Inhalation Therapy", "Pilot Projects", "Spinal Cord Injuries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978541061", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55932240700": {"Name": "Lynch M.", "AuthorID": "55932240700", "AffiliationID": "60007363, 60001590", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Northwestern University"}, "57190230803": {"Name": "Srivatsan S.", "AuthorID": "57190230803", "AffiliationID": "60007363, 60001590", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Northwestern University"}, "57190223961": {"Name": "Deatsch K.", "AuthorID": "57190223961", "AffiliationID": "60007363, 60001590", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Northwestern University"}, "57190230811": {"Name": "Kessler A.", "AuthorID": "57190230811", "AffiliationID": "60007363, 60001590", "AffiliationName": "Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Northwestern University"}, "25225315900": {"Name": "Duffell L.", "AuthorID": "25225315900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "23570936200": {"Name": "Sandhu M.", "AuthorID": "23570936200", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Northwestern University"}, "13609725600": {"Name": "Jayaraman A.", "AuthorID": "13609725600", "AffiliationID": "60007363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences, Northwestern University"}, "7403103922": {"Name": "Mitchell G.", "AuthorID": "7403103922", "AffiliationID": "60013959", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical Therapy and McKnight Brain Institute, University of Florida"}, "7005240532": {"Name": "Rymer W.", "AuthorID": "7005240532", "AffiliationID": "60007363, 60001590", "AffiliationName": "Sensory Motor Performance Program, Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Professor, Northwestern University"}}}
