Within the varied biological activities found in marine products, their antimicrobial activity is one of the most relevant. Infectious diseases are responsible for high levels of morbidity and mortality and many antimicrobials lose their effectiveness with time due to the development of resistance. These facts justify the high importance of finding new, effective and safe anti-infective agents. Among the variety of biological activities of marine xanthone derivatives, one that must be highlighted is their anti-infective properties. In this work, a literature review of marine xanthones with anti-infective activity, namely antibacterial, antifungal, antiparasitic and antiviral, is presented. Their structures, biological activity, sources and the methods used for bioactivity evaluation are described. The xanthone derivatives are grouped in three sets: xanthones, hydroxanthones and glycosylated derivatives. Moreover, molecular descriptors, biophysicochemical properties, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated, and the chemical space occupied by marine xanthone derivatives is recognized. The chemical space was compared with marketed drugs and framed accordingly to the drug-likeness concept in order to profile the pharmacokinetic of anti-infective marine xanthone derivatives.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADME", "Antimicrobial", "Marine", "Physicochemical properties", "Xanthones"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anti-Infective Agents", "Aquatic Organisms", "Biological Products", "Drug Design", "Humans", "Molecular Structure", "Xanthones"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059915496", "SubjectAreas": [["Analytical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1602"], ["Chemistry (miscellaneous)", "CHEM", "1601"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57200531885": {"Name": "Loureiro D.", "AuthorID": "57200531885", "AffiliationID": "60013435", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Center of Marine and Environmental Investigation (CIIMAR/CIMAR), Edif\u00edcio do Terminal de Cruzeiros do Porto de Leix\u00f5es"}, "57207804326": {"Name": "Costa J.", "AuthorID": "57207804326", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto"}, "57195564819": {"Name": "Magalh\u00e3es \u00c1.", "AuthorID": "57195564819", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto"}, "57202660341": {"Name": "Azevedo C.", "AuthorID": "57202660341", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Department of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto"}, "35591287300": {"Name": "Pinto M.", "AuthorID": "35591287300", "AffiliationID": "60013435", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Center of Marine and Environmental Investigation (CIIMAR/CIMAR), Edif\u00edcio do Terminal de Cruzeiros do Porto de Leix\u00f5es"}, "36145043600": {"Name": "Afonso C.", "AuthorID": "36145043600", "AffiliationID": "60013435", "AffiliationName": "Interdisciplinary Center of Marine and Environmental Investigation (CIIMAR/CIMAR), Edif\u00edcio do Terminal de Cruzeiros do Porto de Leix\u00f5es"}, "55581059600": {"Name": "Soares J.", "AuthorID": "55581059600", "AffiliationID": "60007249, 60003408", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Applied Chemistry, LAQV-REQUIMTE, Department of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto"}}}
