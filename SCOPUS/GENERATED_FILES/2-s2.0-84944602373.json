The majority of this chapter focuses on summarizing this literature. The key aim was to look at potential differences in genetic and environmental influences as a function of informant, study design, age of children, and parenting dimension. Across studies we demonstrate higher heritability for negative versus positive aspects of parenting, and contextualize these findings by outlining traditional socialization theories of parenting, enabling us to draw out the implications of the behavioral genetic findings for the field of parenting more generally. Future directions for research are also suggested.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Child-based designs", "Childhood", "Negative parenting", "Parent-based designs", "Positive parenting"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944602373", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7006285069": {"Name": "Pike A.", "AuthorID": "7006285069", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "7103184743": {"Name": "Oliver B.", "AuthorID": "7103184743", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}}}
