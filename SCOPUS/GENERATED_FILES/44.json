Hunters relied heavily on the single prey species, Gazella subgutturosa. This paper reports on isotopic analyses of gazelle teeth, drawn from the Kharaneh IV assemblage, to explore the seasonal and spatial distribution of gazelle in life and examine models of long-distance seasonal gazelle migrations. Dental microwear analysis is also employed to assess hunting seasons. Results from sequential isotope analyses of 11 Epipalaeolithic gazelle molars show that, with one exception, gazelle did not move seasonally from the limestone steppe onto other geologies, nor did they seasonally relocate to areas with different climate regimes. Rather, seasonal herd mobility seems to have been local, meaning animals would have been available in the vicinity of Kharaneh IV year-round. Results from 19 microwear analyses show some gazelle to have died in spring when grass graze was available, whilst others had been browsing around their time of death, indicating non-spring hunting. Microwear evidence thus suggests gazelle were hunted in more than one restricted season. The implications of these new datasets for hunter-gatherer use of the steppe, and potential hunting methods, is highlighted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dental microwear analysis", "Early/Middle Epipalaeolithic", "Gazelle seasonal mobility", "Hunting seasonality", "Oxygen, carbon, strontium isotopes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84999634778", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"36133167100": {"Name": "Henton E.", "AuthorID": "36133167100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "55470564900": {"Name": "Martin L.", "AuthorID": "55470564900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "6506118444": {"Name": "Garrard A.", "AuthorID": "6506118444", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "57192181890": {"Name": "Boles O.", "AuthorID": "57192181890", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "56155054000": {"Name": "Jourdan A.", "AuthorID": "56155054000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Bloomsbury Environmental Isotope Facility"}, "7004811426": {"Name": "Thirlwall M.", "AuthorID": "7004811426", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Royal Holloway University of London"}}}
