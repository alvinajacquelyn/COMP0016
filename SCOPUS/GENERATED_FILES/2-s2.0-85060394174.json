Methods and results Smoking and alcohol use were assessed by questionnaires at 13, 15, and 17 years in 1266 participants (425 males and 841 females) from the ALSPAC study. Smoking status (smokers and non-smoker) and intensity ('high' \u2265100, 'moderate' 20-99, and 'low or never' <20 cigarettes in lifetime) were ascertained. Participants were classified by frequency (low or high) and intensity of drinking [light (LI <2), medium (MI 3-9), and heavy (HI >10 drinks on a typical drinking day)]. Carotid to femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was assessed at 17 years [mean \u00b1 standard deviation and/or mean difference (95% confidence intervals)]. Current smokers had higher PWV compared with non-smokers (P = 0.003). Higher smoking exposure was associated with higher PWV compared with non-smokers [5.81 \u00b1 0.725 vs. 5.71 \u00b1 0.677 m/s, mean adjusted difference 0.211 (0.087-0.334) m/s, P = 0.001]. Participants who stopped smoking had similar PWV to never smokers (P = 0.160). High-intensity drinkers had increased PWV [HI 5.85 \u00b1 0.8 vs. LI 5.67 \u00b1 0.604 m/s, mean adjusted difference 0.266 (0.055-0.476) m/s, P = 0.013]. There was an additive effect of smoking intensity and alcohol intensity, so that 'high' smokers who were also HI drinkers had higher PWV compared with never-smokers and LI drinkers [mean adjusted increase 0.603 (0.229-0.978) m/s, P = 0.002]. Conclusion Smoking exposure even at low levels and intensity of alcohol use were associated individually and together with increased arterial stiffness. Public health strategies need to prevent adoption of these habits in adolescence to preserve or restore arterial health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Alcohol", "Arterial stiffness", "Smoking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Alcohol Drinking", "Blood Pressure", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Pulse Wave Analysis", "Risk Assessment", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Time Factors", "United Kingdom", "Vascular Diseases", "Vascular Resistance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060394174", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"8528765700": {"Name": "Charakida M.", "AuthorID": "8528765700", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, King's College London, St Thomas' Hospital"}, "57188877741": {"Name": "Georgiopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "57188877741", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "14017681400": {"Name": "Dangardt F.", "AuthorID": "14017681400", "AffiliationID": "60008841", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Clinical Physiology, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital"}, "56190407900": {"Name": "Chiesa S.T.", "AuthorID": "56190407900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7401765648": {"Name": "Hughes A.D.", "AuthorID": "7401765648", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "55212114200": {"Name": "Rapala A.", "AuthorID": "55212114200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35461137000": {"Name": "Finer N.", "AuthorID": "35461137000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7004333788": {"Name": "Deanfield J.E.", "AuthorID": "7004333788", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "35354080500": {"Name": "Davey Smith G.", "AuthorID": "35354080500", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Science, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}, "57206515095": {"Name": "Lawlor D.", "AuthorID": "57206515095", "AffiliationID": "60171764, 60020650", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Science, Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol"}}}
