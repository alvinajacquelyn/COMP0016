Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimA uniform dendritic NiCo2S4@NiCo2S4 hierarchical nanostructure of width \u2248100 nm is successfully designed and synthesized. From kinetic analysis of the electrochemical reactions, those electrodes function in rechargeable alkaline batteries (RABs). The dendritic structure exhibited by the electrodes has a high discharge-specific capacity of 4.43 mAh cm\u22122 at a high current density of 240 mA cm\u22122 with a good rate capability of 70.1% after increasing the current densities from 40 to 240 mA cm\u22122. At low scan rate of 0.5 mV s\u22121 in cyclic voltammetry test, the semidiffusion controlled electrochemical reaction contributes \u224892% of the total capacity, this value decreases to \u224843% at a high scan rate of 20 mV s\u22121. These results enable a detailed analysis of the reaction mechanism for RABs and suggest design concepts for new electrode materials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dendritic nanostructures", "kinetic analysis", "nickel cobalt sulfides", "rechargeable alkaline batteries"], "IndexKeywords": ["Dendritic nanostructures", "Dendritic structures", "Discharge specific capacity", "Electrochemical reactions", "Hierarchical Nanostructures", "High current densities", "Kinetic analysis", "Rechargeable alkaline batteries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046534001", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"51763877800": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "51763877800", "AffiliationID": "112920252", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Innovation Institute for Materials"}, "7410091731": {"Name": "Zhou X.", "AuthorID": "7410091731", "AffiliationID": "112920252", "AffiliationName": "Shanghai Innovation Institute for Materials"}, "57193317645": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "57193317645", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "8242699400": {"Name": "Hu J.", "AuthorID": "8242699400", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory for Modification of Chemical Fibers and Polymer Materials, College of Materials Science and Engineering, Donghua University"}, "57199646057": {"Name": "Lin R.", "AuthorID": "57199646057", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55626024600": {"Name": "He G.", "AuthorID": "55626024600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.P.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials Chemistry Centre, Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56045228700": {"Name": "Ho-Kimura S.M.", "AuthorID": "56045228700", "AffiliationID": "60022317", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Applied Physics and Materials Engineering, University of Macau, Avenida da Universidade"}}}
