Methods A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on OCT B-scan images annotated by a senior ground truth expert retina specialist to segment the posterior eye compartments. Independent benchmark data sets (30 SDOCT and 30 SSOCT) were manually segmented by three classes of graders with varying levels of ophthalmic proficiencies. Nine graders contributed to benchmark an additional 60 images in three consecutive runs. Inter-human and intra-human class agreement was measured and compared to the CNN results. Results The CNN training data consisted of a total of 6210 manually segmented images derived from 2070 B-scans (1046 SDOCT and 1024 SSOCT; 630 C-Scans). The CNN segmentation revealed a high agreement with all grader groups. For all compartments and groups, the mean Intersection over Union (IOU) score of CNN compartmentalization versus group graders' compartmentalization was higher than the mean score for intra-grader group comparison. Conclusion The proposed deep learning segmentation algorithm (CNN) for automated eye compartment segmentation in OCT B-scans (SDOCT and SSOCT) is on par with manual segmentations by human graders.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Artificial Intelligence", "Benchmarking", "Choroid", "Deep Learning", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Neural Networks, Computer", "Observer Variation", "Retina", "Sclera", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Vitreous Body"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070780444", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6507518152": {"Name": "Maloca P.M.", "AuthorID": "6507518152", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7006706337": {"Name": "Scholl H.P.N.", "AuthorID": "7006706337", "AffiliationID": "60015891, 60005248", "AffiliationName": "Wilmer Eye Institute, Johns Hopkins University"}, "18037277400": {"Name": "Hasler P.W.", "AuthorID": "18037277400", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Basel"}, "57203991764": {"Name": "De Carvalho E.R.", "AuthorID": "57203991764", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194024408": {"Name": "Fasler K.", "AuthorID": "57194024408", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "8101026700": {"Name": "Egan C.", "AuthorID": "8101026700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55555386500": {"Name": "Heeren T.F.C.", "AuthorID": "55555386500", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "35221042600": {"Name": "Balaskas K.", "AuthorID": "35221042600", "AffiliationID": "120999614", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Ophthalmic Reading Centre"}, "15924308700": {"Name": "Tufail A.", "AuthorID": "15924308700", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26635526200": {"Name": "Lee A.Y.", "AuthorID": "26635526200", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Washington"}, "57194619974": {"Name": "Okada M.", "AuthorID": "57194619974", "AffiliationID": "60019331", "AffiliationName": "Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital"}, "57213071894": {"Name": "Leung I.", "AuthorID": "57213071894", "AffiliationID": "120999614", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Ophthalmic Reading Centre"}, "57210441418": {"Name": "H\u00f6rmann B.", "AuthorID": "57210441418", "AffiliationID": "100503187", "AffiliationName": "Supercomputing Systems"}, "57195574261": {"Name": "Kaiser P.", "AuthorID": "57195574261", "AffiliationID": "100503187", "AffiliationName": "Supercomputing Systems"}, "57210444865": {"Name": "Suter S.", "AuthorID": "57210444865", "AffiliationID": "100503187", "AffiliationName": "Supercomputing Systems"}, "24725877200": {"Name": "Zarranz-Ventura J.", "AuthorID": "24725877200", "AffiliationID": "60030315", "AffiliationName": "Institut Cl\u00ednic d'Oftalmologia, Hospital Cl\u00ednic de Barcelona"}}}
