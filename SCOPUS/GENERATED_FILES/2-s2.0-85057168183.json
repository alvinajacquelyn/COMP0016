The research focused on tracing evidence for a catastrophic flood that buried the village beneath a thick layer of debris, including examining the remains of structures and agricultural land sealed beneath the debris, and considering the social and economic implications of the event in the subsequent history of the area. First, a series of test pits was excavated within the area of the modern village to map the full extent of the damage. Following this, analysis of the stratigraphy, architectural remains, datable artefacts and radiocarbon dating contributed further details, while historical evidence revealed the privatisation of the agricultural land following the catastrophe. The findings offer a snapshot of climate change and its social contexts in a specific, under-studied area with possible implications for the study of risk behaviour and disaster response in currently inhabited areas.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Climate change archeology", "flash-flood", "Little Ice Age", "social consequences"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057168183", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"], ["Environmental Science (miscellaneous)", "ENVI", "2301"]], "AuthorData": {"57194851056": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez J.", "AuthorID": "57194851056", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "23768402400": {"Name": "Moshenska G.", "AuthorID": "23768402400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Archaeology"}, "57209570889": {"Name": "Iriarte E.", "AuthorID": "57209570889", "AffiliationID": "60022866", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Evoluci\u00f3n Humana, Departamento de Historia, Geograf\u00eda y Comunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad de Burgos"}}}
