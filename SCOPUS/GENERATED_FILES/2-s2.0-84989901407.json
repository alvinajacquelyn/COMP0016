We show for the first time a multi-modal photoacoustic tomography (PAT), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography system with an articulated probe to extract human cutaneous vasculature in vivo in various skin regions. OCT angiography supplements the microvasculature which PAT alone is unable to provide. Co-registered volumes for vessel network is further embedded in the morphologic image provided by OCT. This multi-modal system is therefore demonstrated as a valuable tool for comprehensive non-invasive human skin vasculature and morphology imaging in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiac output", "In-vivo human skin", "Micro-vasculature", "Multi-modal", "Multimodal system", "Pathological process", "Photoacoustic tomography", "Vessel networks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84989901407", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"55671457100": {"Name": "Liu M.", "AuthorID": "55671457100", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57189731255": {"Name": "Chen Z.", "AuthorID": "57189731255", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna"}, "43761658800": {"Name": "Zabihian B.", "AuthorID": "43761658800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56595277000": {"Name": "Ginner L.", "AuthorID": "56595277000", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004011596": {"Name": "Leitgeb R.A.", "AuthorID": "7004011596", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7007044980": {"Name": "Drexler W.", "AuthorID": "7007044980", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57191359387": {"Name": "Sinz C.", "AuthorID": "57191359387", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56211928800": {"Name": "Kittler H.", "AuthorID": "56211928800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7102686951": {"Name": "Zhang E.", "AuthorID": "7102686951", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006238023": {"Name": "Beard P.C.", "AuthorID": "7006238023", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "19337112000": {"Name": "Hoover E.", "AuthorID": "19337112000", "AffiliationID": "112570121", "AffiliationName": "INSIGHT Photonic Solutions, Inc"}, "6506922411": {"Name": "Minneman M.P.", "AuthorID": "6506922411", "AffiliationID": "112570121", "AffiliationName": "INSIGHT Photonic Solutions, Inc"}}}
