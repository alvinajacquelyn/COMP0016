A number of uveitic entities may be complicated by the development of choroidal neovascularization leading to a decrease in central visual acuity. In conditions such as punctate inner choroidopathy, development of choroidal neovascularization is extremely common and must be suspected in all cases. On the other hand, in patients with conditions such as serpiginous choroiditis, and multifocal choroiditis, it may be difficult to differentiate between inflammatory choroiditis lesions and choroidal neovascularization. Multimodal imaging analysis, including the recently introduced technology of optical coherence tomography angiography, greatly aid in the diagnosis and management of inflammatory choroidal neovascularization. Management of these neovascular membranes consists of anti-vascular growth factor agents, with or without concomitant anti-inflammatory and/or corticosteroid therapy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choroiditis", "EDI-OCT", "Fluorescein angiography", "Indocyanine green angiography", "Inflammatory choroidal neovascularization", "Optical coherence tomography angiography", "Posterior uveitis", "Uveitis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053260672", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57209565397": {"Name": "Agarwal A.", "AuthorID": "57209565397", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Eye Center, Department of Ophthalmology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"}, "57198315222": {"Name": "Aggarwal K.", "AuthorID": "57198315222", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Eye Center, Department of Ophthalmology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"}, "55290727300": {"Name": "Handa S.", "AuthorID": "55290727300", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Eye Center, Department of Ophthalmology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"}, "35452834800": {"Name": "Gupta V.", "AuthorID": "35452834800", "AffiliationID": "60000137", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Eye Center, Department of Ophthalmology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER)"}, "36846060800": {"Name": "Invernizzi A.", "AuthorID": "36846060800", "AffiliationID": "60002200, 60030318", "AffiliationName": "Eye Clinic, Department of Biomedical and Clinical Science \u201cL.
