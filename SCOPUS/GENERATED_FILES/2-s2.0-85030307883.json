KGaA, WeinheimThe structure and hydration of polyamide (PA) membranes are investigated with a combination of neutron and X-ray reflectivity, and their performance is benchmarked in reverse osmosis water desalination. PA membranes are synthesized by the interfacial polymerization of m-phenylenediamine (MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC), varying systematically reaction time, concentration, and stoichiometry, to yield large-area exceptionally planar films of \u224810 nm thickness. Reflectivity is employed to precisely determine membrane thickness and roughness, as well as the (TMC/MPD) concentration profile, and response to hydration in the vapor phase. PA film thickness is found to increase linearly with reaction time, albeit with a nonzero intercept, and the composition cross-sectional profile is found to be uniform, at the conditions investigated. Vapor hydration with H2O and D2O from 0 to 100% relative humidity results in considerable swelling (up to 20%), but also yields uniform cross-sectional profiles. The resulting film thickness is found to be predominantly set by the MPD concentration, while TMC regulates water uptake. A favorable correlation is found between higher swelling and water uptake with permeance. The data provide quantitative insight into the film formation mechanisms and correlate reaction conditions, cross-sectional nanostructure, and performance of the PA active layer in RO membranes for desalination.", "AuthorKeywords": ["neutron reflectivity", "polyamide active layers", "reverse osmosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concentration profiles", "Cross sectional profiles", "Interfacial polymerization", "M phenylenediamine", "Neutron reflectivity", "Polyamide active layers", "Polyamide membranes", "Reaction conditions"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030307883", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"6507657713": {"Name": "Foglia F.", "AuthorID": "6507657713", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, King\u2019s College London"}, "12647038500": {"Name": "Karan S.", "AuthorID": "12647038500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56374029600": {"Name": "Nania M.", "AuthorID": "56374029600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56701321700": {"Name": "Jiang Z.", "AuthorID": "56701321700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7102581618": {"Name": "Livingston A.G.", "AuthorID": "7102581618", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7201350220": {"Name": "Cabral J.T.", "AuthorID": "7201350220", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57204340069": {"Name": "Porter A.E.", "AuthorID": "57204340069", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Imperial College London"}, "55678441700": {"Name": "Barker R.", "AuthorID": "55678441700", "AffiliationID": "60008877", "AffiliationName": "School of Science and Engineering, University of Dundee"}}}
