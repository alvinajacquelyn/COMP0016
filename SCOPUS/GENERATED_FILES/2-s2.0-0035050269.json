The table includes 95% confidence intervals on predictions of numerical age from 87Sr/86Sr. This version includes the Triassic and Paleozoic record (0-509 Ma) omitted from previous versions because of the paucity of adequate data at the time of preparation. We highlight differences between the previous versions of the table and the current version and discuss some aspects of the 87Sr/86Sr record that may have geological significance. We give examples of how the table can be used and where it has proven useful.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-0035050269", "SubjectAreas": [["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"23047645000": {"Name": "McArthur J.", "AuthorID": "23047645000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Geological Sciences, University College London"}, "7101808739": {"Name": "Howarth R.", "AuthorID": "7101808739", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Geological Sciences, University College London"}, "9238981100": {"Name": "Bailey T.", "AuthorID": "9238981100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Geological Sciences, University College London"}}}
