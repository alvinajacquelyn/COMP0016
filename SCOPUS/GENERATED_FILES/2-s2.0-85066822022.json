All rights reserved.Objectives We have investigated the efficacy of mono- and combined therapy with green tea extract (GTE) in mobilizing redox iron, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), and improving insulin production in iron-loaded pancreatic cells. Methods Rat insulinoma pancreatic \u03b2-cells were iron-loaded using culture medium supplemented with either fetal bovine serum or ferric ammonium citrate and treated with various doses of GTE for epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) equivalence and in combination with iron chelators. Cellular iron, ROS, and secretory insulin were measured. Results The rat insulinoma pancreatic cells took up iron from fetal bovine serum more rapidly than ferric ammonium citrate. After treatment with GTE (0.23-2.29 \u03bcg EGCG equivalent), cellular levels of iron and ROS were dose dependently decreased. Importantly, secretory insulin levels were increased nearly 2.5-fold with 2.29 \u03bcg of EGCG equivalent GTE, indicating a recovery in insulin production. Conclusions Green tea EGCG ameliorated oxidative damage of iron-loaded \u03b2-cells by removing redox iron and free radicals and attenuating insulin production. The impact can result in the restoration of pancreatic functions and an increase in insulin production. Green tea extract exerts iron-chelating, free-radical scavenging, and pancreato-protective effects in the restoration of \u03b2-cell functions, all of which we believe can increase insulin production in diabetic \u03b2-thalassemia patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["green tea; EGCG", "insulin", "iron overload", "pancreatic cell", "RINm5F"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "beta-Thalassemia", "Catechin", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Diabetes Complications", "Insulin", "Insulin Secretion", "Insulin-Secreting Cells", "Iron", "Phytotherapy", "Plant Extracts", "Rats", "Reactive Oxygen Species", "Tea"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066822022", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57214922704": {"Name": "Koonyosying P.", "AuthorID": "57214922704", "AffiliationID": "60000881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University"}, "56021435200": {"Name": "Srichairatanakool S.", "AuthorID": "56021435200", "AffiliationID": "60000881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University"}, "6506745479": {"Name": "Uthaipibull C.", "AuthorID": "6506745479", "AffiliationID": "60011947, 60004391", "AffiliationName": "Protein-Ligand Engineering and Molecular Biology Laboratory, National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, National Science and Technology Development Agency"}, "7103089590": {"Name": "Fucharoen S.", "AuthorID": "7103089590", "AffiliationID": "60012718", "AffiliationName": "Thalassemia Research Center, Institute of Molecular Bioscience, Mahidol University Salaya Campus"}, "57189792638": {"Name": "Koumoutsea E.V.", "AuthorID": "57189792638", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}, "7403427269": {"Name": "Porter J.B.", "AuthorID": "7403427269", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, University College London"}}}
