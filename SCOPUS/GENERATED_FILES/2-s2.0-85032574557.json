It shows how a tendency to lump all the Cockneys together in October 1817 slowly developed into a more discriminating attitude in the course of the revamped magazine\u2019s first year. It also shows how the principles behind that discrimination lay in Lockhart\u2019s reading of Schlegel\u2019s lectures, and in the models of scholarship and genial reading that were contained therein.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cockney", "Coleridge", "Frederick Schlegel", "Genial criticism", "Hazlitt", "Lamb", "Lockhart", "Wilson"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032574557", "SubjectAreas": [["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"56726727500": {"Name": "Dart G.", "AuthorID": "56726727500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
