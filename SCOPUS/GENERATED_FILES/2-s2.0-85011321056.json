We investigate the associations between context-specific sitting and incident diabetes in a cohort of mid-aged to older British civil servants. Methods Using data from the Whitehall II study (n=4811), Cox proportional hazards models (adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, employment grade, smoking, alcohol intake, fruit and vegetable consumption, self-rated health, physical functioning, walking and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and body mass index (BMI)) were fitted to examine associations between total sitting and context-specific sitting time (work, television (TV), non-TV leisure time sitting at home) at phase 5 (1997-1999) and fasting glucose-defined incident diabetes up to 2011. Results Total sitting (HR of the top compared with the bottom group: 1.26; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.62; p=0.01) and TV sitting (1.33; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.88; p=0.05) showed associations with incident diabetes; once BMI was included in the model these associations were attenuated for both total sitting (1.19; 95% CI 0.92 to 1.55; p=0.22) and TV sitting (1.31; 95% CI 0.96 to 1.76; p=0.14). Conclusion We found limited evidence linking sitting and incident diabetes over 13 years in this occupational cohort of civil servants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetes", "Epidemiology", "Physical activity", "Sedentary", "Sitting time"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adiposity", "Adult", "Body Mass Index", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Risk Factors", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011321056", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"55847987800": {"Name": "Stamatakis E.", "AuthorID": "55847987800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "25421265100": {"Name": "Bauman A.", "AuthorID": "25421265100", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Charles Perkins Centre, School of Public Health, University of Sydney, The Hub, Charles Perkins Centre, Building D17"}, "24576354300": {"Name": "Brunner E.", "AuthorID": "24576354300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "20133865900": {"Name": "Britton A.", "AuthorID": "20133865900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "42762062500": {"Name": "Pulsford R.", "AuthorID": "42762062500", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Sport and Health Sciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "6603507307": {"Name": "Hillsdon M.", "AuthorID": "6603507307", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Sport and Health Sciences, College of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Exeter"}, "57203868033": {"Name": "Biddle S.", "AuthorID": "57203868033", "AffiliationID": "60006234", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Sport, Exercise and Active Living (ISEAL), Victoria University"}}}
