In addition to the production of autoantibodies, B cells can contribute to disease development by presenting autoantigens to autoreactive T cells and by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which leads to the amplification of the inflammatory response. Targeting both the antibody-dependent and antibody-independent function of B cells in adult rheumatic disease has led to the advent of B cell targeted therapies in clinical practice. To date, whether B cell depletion could also be utilized for the treatment of pediatric disease is relatively under explored. In this review, we will discuss the role of B cells in the pathogenesis of the pediatric rheumatic diseases Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), Juvenile Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (JSLE) and Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM). We will also explore the rationale behind the use of B cell-targeted therapies in pediatric rheumatic disease by highlighting new case studies that points to their efficacy in JIA, JSLE, and JDM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmunity", "B cells", "Biologics", "Inflammation", "Pediatric autoimmune diseases"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065921188", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57208839767": {"Name": "Ll Wilkinson M.G.", "AuthorID": "57208839767", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "40561697500": {"Name": "Rosser E.C.", "AuthorID": "40561697500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
