ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.Purpose To evaluate retinal anatomy and segmentation errors from spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging in school-aged children. Design A prospective cohort study in a referral medical center. Methods One hundred thirty-three eyes of 133 patients were enrolled. Patients were grouped as those who were treated for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (ROP-Tx group); those with spontaneously regressed ROP (ROP-non-Tx group); other premature patients (premature group); and full-term age-matched children (full-term group). Anatomy and segmentation errors of retina were evaluated by SD-OCT. Results The mean age at assessment was 9.5 years (range, 4-16 years). The external limiting membrane (ELM) and the cone outer segment tips (COST) line were least frequently identified in patients of the ROP-Tx group (65.2% and 47.8%, P =.002 and P <.001, respectively). The visual acuity of the patients did not correlate significantly with the absence of COST line (P =.140) but correlated with the absence of ELM (P <.001). The presence of artifacts, including misidentification of the inner retina, misidentification of the outer retina, out-of-register artifacts, off-center scans, and degraded scan images, was observed to range from 0.6% to 50.0% in 4 groups of patients. All types of errors occurred more frequently in the ROP-Tx group than in the full-term group (all P <.05). Conclusions Outer retinal abnormalities were commonly observed in the ROP-Tx group. The higher segmentation errors in the ROP-Tx group might be related to fine structural abnormalities in the outer retina. Future studies are needed to investigate the mechanisms for these structural changes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Artifacts", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Cryotherapy", "Diagnostic Errors", "Female", "Gestational Age", "Humans", "Laser Coagulation", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Retinal Photoreceptor Cell Outer Segment", "Retinopathy of Prematurity", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965050690", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"56003091700": {"Name": "Chen Y.H.", "AuthorID": "56003091700", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "55907419700": {"Name": "Huang C.Y.", "AuthorID": "55907419700", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "34877866400": {"Name": "Wang N.K.", "AuthorID": "34877866400", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "10439600500": {"Name": "Chen Y.P.", "AuthorID": "10439600500", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "7102702792": {"Name": "Chao A.N.", "AuthorID": "7102702792", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "26639018900": {"Name": "Chen K.J.", "AuthorID": "26639018900", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "56336877900": {"Name": "Chen T.L.", "AuthorID": "56336877900", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "7402311137": {"Name": "Hwang Y.S.", "AuthorID": "7402311137", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "7403086404": {"Name": "Lai C.C.", "AuthorID": "7403086404", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "24469425800": {"Name": "Wu W.C.", "AuthorID": "24469425800", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "7005375754": {"Name": "Lien R.", "AuthorID": "7005375754", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Chang Gung University"}, "7102873397": {"Name": "Chiang M.F.", "AuthorID": "7102873397", "AffiliationID": "60016733", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Ophthalmology and Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology, Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health and Science University"}, "56313149300": {"Name": "Chang C.J.", "AuthorID": "56313149300", "AffiliationID": "60020351", "AffiliationName": "Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, Chang Gung University"}}}
