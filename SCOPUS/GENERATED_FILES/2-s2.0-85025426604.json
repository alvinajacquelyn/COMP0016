The future of peripros- thetic joint infections may at first appear bleak. The number of arthroplasty procedures is growing, parallel with an aging population, and if the incidence of infections remains constant, the number of patients suffering will also increase. However, multiple initiatives and strategies have been, or are being, developed to help improve the fight against these infections. We may be on the brink of reducing the impact these devastating infections have upon our patients, as well as reducing their socioeconomic impact. This chapter reviews many of these encouraging strategies, which gives us hope that all is not as bad as we had first thought.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antibiofilm coatings", "Antibiotic coatings", "Bioactive glass", "Future", "Magnetic fields", "Nano-technology", "Next-generation sequencing", "Periprosthetic joint infection", "Photodynamic therapy", "Silver", "Ultra-violet light"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85025426604", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Health Professions (all)", "HEAL", "3600"]], "AuthorData": {"57200399194": {"Name": "George D.A.", "AuthorID": "57200399194", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College Hospital London"}, "7203033976": {"Name": "Haddad F.S.", "AuthorID": "7203033976", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Trauma and Orthopaedics, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
