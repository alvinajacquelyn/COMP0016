Further, the findings suggest the need for greater awareness and educational programmes to inform the general public accurately regarding BPD and to improve mental health literacy.Introduction: This study was part of a programmatic series into mental health literacy, specifically lay people\u2019s knowledge of causes, manifestations and cures of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The aim was to determine to what extent non-experts understood BDP and to what extent they held erroneous beliefs about specific aspects of the causes and cures for the disorder.Method: A convenience sample of 102 participants completed a vignette-identification task that required them to answer open-ended questions about hypothetical people with four psychological problems, one of which was BPD and a 50-item questionnaire divided into three sections about BDP.Results: Analysis of the vignette identification task revealed very low rates of recognition for BPD, with participants significantly more likely to identify depression, schizophrenia or psychopathy. Participants\u2019 generally favoured psychological and sociological treatments, as well as rating early trauma and stress as possible causes of the symptoms of the person described in the BDP vignette. There were logical relationships between perceptions of cause and cure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Borderline personality disorder lay beliefs", "Help recommendations", "Mental health disorders", "Mental health literacy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Borderline Personality Disorder", "Female", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Health Literacy", "Humans", "Male", "Mental Health", "Middle Aged", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939878776", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36045985300": {"Name": "Furnham A.", "AuthorID": "36045985300", "AffiliationID": "60007996", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Business School (BI)"}, "56281059200": {"Name": "Lee V.", "AuthorID": "56281059200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "56281138200": {"Name": "Kolzeev V.", "AuthorID": "56281138200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}}}
