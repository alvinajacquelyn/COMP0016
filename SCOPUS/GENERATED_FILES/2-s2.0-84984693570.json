First, we consider the 'active ageing' agenda and what this means for how leisure travel may be thought about in academia and beyond. Second, we turn to studies underpinned by worries about the appetite for significant consumption thought to typify the 'baby-boomer' generation and question whether these studies could inadvertently be promoting the very future they hope to avoid. Third, we explore how research on the benefits of everyday 'mobility' in later life may have morphed into a more general belief about the value of travel in older age. Finally, we reflect on how relevant studies of tourism are often underpinned by an argument about the financial rewards that now await those ready to target the older traveller. Our overall contention is that, though for different reasons, all four could be serving to encourage more later-life travel. Whilst for some this prospect is not at all troubling, the spectre of adverse energy demand consequences leads us to explore a more critical view.", "AuthorKeywords": ["active ageing", "baby boomers", "energy demand", "mobility", "Tourism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984693570", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57205914586": {"Name": "Hitchings R.", "AuthorID": "57205914586", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College"}, "8266375600": {"Name": "Venn S.", "AuthorID": "8266375600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College"}, "7402616688": {"Name": "Day R.", "AuthorID": "7402616688", "AffiliationID": "60019702", "AffiliationName": "School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham"}}}
