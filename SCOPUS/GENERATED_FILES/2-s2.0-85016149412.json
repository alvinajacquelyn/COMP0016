Cross sections are collected and reviewed for total scattering, elastic scattering, momentum transfer, excitations of rotational and vibrational states, dissociation, ionization, and dissociative attachment. The data derived from swarm experiments are also considered. For each of these processes, the recommended values of the cross sections are presented. The literature has been surveyed through early 2016.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Attachment", "Dissociation", "Electron collisions", "Evaluation", "Ionization", "Total cross sections"], "IndexKeywords": ["Attachment", "Cross section data", "Dissociative attachment", "Electron collision", "Evaluation", "Recommended values", "Total cross sections", "Vibrational state"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016149412", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"36615843600": {"Name": "Song M.Y.", "AuthorID": "36615843600", "AffiliationID": "60104266", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Technology Research Center, National Fusion Research Institute"}, "7403587920": {"Name": "Yoon J.S.", "AuthorID": "7403587920", "AffiliationID": "60104266", "AffiliationName": "Plasma Technology Research Center, National Fusion Research Institute"}, "7403936982": {"Name": "Cho H.", "AuthorID": "7403936982", "AffiliationID": "60022417", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Chungnam National University"}, "35600812200": {"Name": "Karwasz G.P.", "AuthorID": "35600812200", "AffiliationID": "60021858", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Informatics, University Nicolaus Copernicus"}, "6603870414": {"Name": "Kokoouline V.", "AuthorID": "6603870414", "AffiliationID": "60022144", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Central Florida"}, "57218971249": {"Name": "Nakamura Y.", "AuthorID": "57218971249", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
