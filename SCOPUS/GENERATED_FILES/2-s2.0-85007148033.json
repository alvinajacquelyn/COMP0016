In applications however, the utility of the approach is limited by the fact that the asymptotic sampling distribution of the estimator typically depends on third-order and fourth-order properties of the process that may be difficult to obtain. In this article, we show how the methodology can be embedded in the standard framework of estimating functions, which allows the asymptotic distribution to be estimated empirically without calculating higher-order spectra. We also demonstrate that some aspects of the inference, such as the calculation of confidence regions for the entire parameter vector, can be inaccurate but that a small adjustment, designed for application in situations where a mis-specified likelihood is used for inference, can lead to marked improvements.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Estimating function", "rainfall", "sandwich estimator", "spectral analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007148033", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55215226900": {"Name": "Jesus J.", "AuthorID": "55215226900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "7101629322": {"Name": "Chandler R.", "AuthorID": "7101629322", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
