Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light (NFL) concentration is a general marker of damage to large-calibermyelinated axons. OBJECTIVE To test whether CSF NFL concentration is associated with cognitive decline and imaging evidence of neurodegeneration and white matter change in AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A commercially available immunoassaywas used to analyze CSF NFL concentration in a cohort of patients with AD (n = 95) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 192) and in cognitively normal individuals (n = 110) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The study dates were January 2005 to December 2007. The NFL analysis was performed in November 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Correlationwas investigated among baseline CSF NFL concentration and longitudinal cognitive impairment, white matter change, and regional brain atrophy within each diagnostic group. RESULTS Cerebrospinal fluid NFL concentration (median [interquartile range]) was higher in the AD dementia group (1479 [1134-1842] pg/mL), stable MCI group (no progression to AD during follow-up; 1182 [923-1687] pg/mL), and progressive MCI group (MCI with progression to AD dementia during follow-up; 1336 [1061-1693] pg/mL) compared with control participants (1047 [809-1265] pg/mL) (P < .001 for all) and in the AD dementia group compared with the stable MCI group (P = .01). In the MCI group, a higher CSF NFL concentration was associated with faster brain atrophy over time as measured by changes in whole-brain volume (\u00df = -4177, P = .003), ventricular volume (\u00df = 1835, P < .001), and hippocampus volume (\u00df = -54.22, P < .001); faster disease progression as reflected by decreased Mini-Mental State Examination scores (\u00df = -1.077, P < .001) and increased Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale scores (\u00df = 2.30, P < .001); and faster white matter intensity change (\u00df = 598.7, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Cerebrospinal fluid NFL concentration is increased by the early clinical stage of AD and is associated with cognitive deterioration and structural brain changes over time. This finding corroborates the contention that degeneration of large-caliber axons is an important feature of AD neurodegeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Mild Cognitive Impairment", "Neurofilament Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954224391", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "55345176500": {"Name": "Skillb\u00e4ck T.", "AuthorID": "55345176500", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg"}, "23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Lund University"}, "57203177938": {"Name": "Weiner M.", "AuthorID": "57203177938", "AffiliationID": "60023691, 60105915", "AffiliationName": "Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of California"}, "57202554064": {"Name": "Trojanowski J.", "AuthorID": "57202554064", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Institute on Aging, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine"}, "57203176542": {"Name": "Shaw L.", "AuthorID": "57203176542", "AffiliationID": "60003711", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Institute on Aging, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine"}}}
