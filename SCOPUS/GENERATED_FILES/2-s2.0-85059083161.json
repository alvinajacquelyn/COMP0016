It is eminently possible that alternative spacetimes, and even alternative theories of gravity may describe the black hole candidate in our Galactic centre. To this end, we investigate the possibility of distinguishing a black hole in the Kerr-Taub-NUT (KTN) spacetime from the standard Kerr solution. Coupling ray-tracing calculations with a fully covariant general-relativistic (GR) radiative transport formalism we calculate and compare the observed electromagnetic emissions and images from the vicinity of both KTN and Kerr spacetimes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Black hole physics", "Gravitational lensing", "Relativistic processes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Black hole candidates", "Black Hole physics", "Electromagnetic emissions", "Galactic centres", "General Relativity", "Gravitational lensing", "Ray tracing calculations", "Strong field"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059083161", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"]], "AuthorData": {"55347813900": {"Name": "Younsi Z.", "AuthorID": "55347813900", "AffiliationID": "106076281", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik"}, "56224133000": {"Name": "Grenzebach A.", "AuthorID": "56224133000", "AffiliationID": "60008293", "AffiliationName": "ZARM, Universit\u00e4t Bremen"}}}
