In this regime, the Coulomb effect on the two-electron states is calculated and found to lead to four split energy levels, including two anticrossing-level and two crossing-level states. Moreover, due to the interplay of anticrossing and crossing effects, our calculations reveal that the ground two-electron state will switch from one anticrossing state (strong confinement) to a crossing state (intermediate confinement) as the channel width gradually increases and then back to the original anticrossing state (weak confinement) as the channel width becomes larger than a threshold value. This switching behavior leaves a footprint in the ballistic conductance as well as in the diffusion thermoelectric power of electrons. Such a switching is related to the triple spin degeneracy as well as to the Coulomb repulsion in the central region of the channel, which separates two electrons away and pushes them to different channel edges. The conductance reoccurrence region expands from the weak to the intermediate confinement regime with increasing electron density.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Ballistic conductance", "Ballistic transports", "Conduction channel", "Coulomb repulsions", "Low temperatures", "Quasi-one dimensional", "Strong confinement", "Switching behaviors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84948390578", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"7403890391": {"Name": "Huang D.", "AuthorID": "7403890391", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "Center for High Technology Materials, University of New Mexico"}, "7005735990": {"Name": "Gumbs G.", "AuthorID": "7005735990", "AffiliationID": "60033021", "AffiliationName": "Center for High Technology Materials, University of New Mexico"}, "6603445981": {"Name": "Abranyos Y.", "AuthorID": "6603445981", "AffiliationID": "60007033, 60002896", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Hunter College of the City University of New York"}, "56463590500": {"Name": "Pepper M.", "AuthorID": "56463590500", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "57202530291": {"Name": "Kumar S.", "AuthorID": "57202530291", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}}}
