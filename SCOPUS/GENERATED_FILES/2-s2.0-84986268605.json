The paper identifies gaps that emerge between disciplinary geographical knowledge production and area studies knowledge production, particularly connections to non-western areas on which many geographers work. It suggests these gaps are symptomatic and productive of the discipline\u2019s problematically constituted community: the \u2018we\u2019 of Geography\u2019s vanguard. The paper charts the precipitation of these tensions within Geography\u2019s disciplinary dispositif before suggesting three alternative knowledge production tactics aimed at closing any such gaps and that in turn democratically reconstitute disciplinary Geography\u2019s \u2018we\u2019.", "AuthorKeywords": ["area studies", "discipline", "EuroAmericanism", "Geography", "knowledge", "politics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986268605", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"14019662300": {"Name": "Jazeel T.", "AuthorID": "14019662300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
