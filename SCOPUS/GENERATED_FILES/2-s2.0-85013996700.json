Our results entail a revision of the ground-state enthalpy-pressure phase diagram. Specifically, we find that the C2/c HS2 structure is persistent up to 440 GPa before undergoing a phase transition into the C2/m phase. Contrary to density functional theory, our calculations suggest that the C2/m phase of HS is more stable than the I41/amd HS structure over the whole pressure range from 150 to 400 GPa. More importantly, we predict that the Im-3m phase is the most likely candidate for H3S, which is consistent with recent experimental x-ray diffraction measurements.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion monte carlo", "Diffusion quantum monte carlo", "High pressure hydrogen", "Most likely", "Pressure phase", "Whole pressure ranges", "X-ray diffraction measurements"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013996700", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"14627363100": {"Name": "Azadi S.", "AuthorID": "14627363100", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science, Royal School of Mines, Thomas Young Center, London Centre for Nanotechnology, Imperial College London"}, "57219972170": {"Name": "K\u00fchne T.D.", "AuthorID": "57219972170", "AffiliationID": "60020238", "AffiliationName": "Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing, Institute for Lightweight Design with Hybrid Systems, University of Paderborn"}}}
