Their chemical synthesis presents several challenges in establishing at least two chiral centres. Here a de novo metabolic pathway using a transketolase enzyme coupled with a transaminase enzyme has been assembled. To synthesise this motif one of the strategies to obtain high conversions from the transaminase/transketolase cascade is the use of hydroxypyruvate (HPA) as a two-carbon donor for the transketolase reaction; although commercially available it is relatively expensive limiting application of the pathway on an industrial scale. Alternately, HPA can be synthesised but this introduces a further synthetic step. In this study two different biocatalytic strategies were developed for the synthesis of (2S,3R)-2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT) without adding HPA into the reaction. Firstly, a sequential cascade of three enzymatic steps (two transaminases and one transketolase) for the synthesis of ABT from serine, pyruvate and glycolaldehyde as substrates. Secondly, a two-step recycling cascade where serine is used as donor to aminate erythrulose (catalysed by a transketolase) for the simultaneous synthesis of ABT and HPA. In order to test the novel pathways, three new transaminases are described, two \u03c9-transaminases able to accept a broad range of amine acceptors with serine as amine donor; and an \u03b1-transaminase, which showed high affinity towards serine (K<inf>M</inf>: 18mM) using pyruvate as amine acceptor. After implementation of the above enzymes in the biocatalytic pathways proposed in this paper, the two-step recycling pathway was found to be the most promising for its integration with E. coli metabolism. It was more efficient (10-fold higher conversion), more sustainable and cost-effective (use of low cost natural substrates and only two enzymes), and the reaction could be performed in a one-pot system.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cascades", "Chiral amino alcohols", "Recycling system", "Transaminase", "Transketolase"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chiral amino alcohols", "Glycosidase inhibitors", "Omega-transaminases", "Recycling pathways", "Recycling systems", "Simultaneous synthesis", "Transaminase", "Transketolase", "Amino Alcohols", "Bacterial Proteins", "Biocatalysis", "Bioengineering", "Biosynthetic Pathways", "Kinetics", "Pyruvates", "Recombinant Proteins", "Stereoisomerism", "Transaminases", "Transketolase"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939600206", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"56515416600": {"Name": "Villegas-Torres M.", "AuthorID": "56515416600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "6603502108": {"Name": "Baganz F.", "AuthorID": "6603502108", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "55547113393": {"Name": "Ward J.", "AuthorID": "55547113393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, Department of Biochemical Engineering"}, "23111047200": {"Name": "Martinez-Torres R.", "AuthorID": "23111047200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, ISMB, University College London"}, "36136654500": {"Name": "Cazeres A.", "AuthorID": "36136654500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603904305": {"Name": "Hailes H.", "AuthorID": "6603904305", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
