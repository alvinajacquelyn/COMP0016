Increased cellular and plasma levels of Gb3 and Lyso-Gb3 affect multiple organs, with specific clinical consequences for the kidneys, heart and brain. There is growing evidence that alterations in glycosphingolipids may have an oncogenic role and this prompted a review of cases of cancer and benign lesions in a large single centre cohort of Fabry patients. We also explored whether there is a difference in the risk of cancer in Fabry patients compared to the general population. Results: Our results suggest that Fabry patients may have a marginally reduced rate of all cancer (incidence rate ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.99) but possibly increased rates of melanoma, urological malignancies and meningiomas. Conclusion: Greater knowledge and awareness of cancer in patients with Fabry disease may help identify at-risk individuals and elucidate cancer mechanisms in this rare inherited disease, which may potentially be relevant to the wider cancer population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer: CNS", "Cancer: Dermatological", "Cancer: Urological", "Fabry disease", "Genetics", "Haematology", "Lysosomal storage disorders"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Confidence Intervals", "Fabry Disease", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Lysosomal Storage Diseases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasms", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028951813", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57195581017": {"Name": "Bird S.", "AuthorID": "57195581017", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56921222900": {"Name": "Mehta A.", "AuthorID": "56921222900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57214714076": {"Name": "Ramaswami U.", "AuthorID": "57214714076", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "55186237200": {"Name": "Hughes D.", "AuthorID": "55186237200", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195576343": {"Name": "Hadjimichael E.", "AuthorID": "57195576343", "AffiliationID": "60025016", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust"}}}
