MRI techniques can be used as regular monitoring to help stage patients with MS and measure disease progression. MRI can also be used to measure lesion burden, thus providing useful information for the prediction of long-term disability. With the introduction of a new generation of immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of MS, MRI also makes an important contribution to the monitoring of treatment, and can be used to determine baseline tissue damage and detect subsequent repair. This use of MRI can help predict treatment response and assess the efficacy and safety of new therapies. In the second part of the MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS) network's guidelines on the use of MRI in MS, we focus on the implementation of this technique in prognostic and monitoring tasks. We present recommendations on how and when to use MRI for disease monitoring, and discuss some promising MRI approaches that may be introduced into clinical practice in the near future.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Consensus", "Disease Progression", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Multiple Sclerosis", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942991168", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"8302719300": {"Name": "Wattjes M.P.", "AuthorID": "8302719300", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "MS Centre Amsterdam, Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine and Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "35360606800": {"Name": "Polman C.", "AuthorID": "35360606800", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "MS Centre Amsterdam, Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine and Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "MS Centre Amsterdam, Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine and Neurology, VU University Medical Centre"}, "7102462625": {"Name": "Rovira \u00c0.", "AuthorID": "7102462625", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Magnetic Resonance Unit, Autonomous University of Barcelona"}, "37025416000": {"Name": "Auger C.", "AuthorID": "37025416000", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Magnetic Resonance Unit, Autonomous University of Barcelona"}, "7007177960": {"Name": "Montalban X.", "AuthorID": "7007177960", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Magnetic Resonance Unit, Autonomous University of Barcelona"}, "35416724300": {"Name": "Tintor\u00e9 M.", "AuthorID": "35416724300", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Neurology/Neuroimmunology Unit, Autonomous University of Barcelona"}, "24463840100": {"Name": "Tur C.", "AuthorID": "24463840100", "AffiliationID": "60023020", "AffiliationName": "Neurology/Neuroimmunology Unit, Autonomous University of Barcelona"}, "57202559286": {"Name": "Miller D.", "AuthorID": "57202559286", "AffiliationID": "100521515", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre"}, "7006486284": {"Name": "Yousry T.A.", "AuthorID": "7006486284", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, UCLH National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7005617741": {"Name": "Sormani M.P.", "AuthorID": "7005617741", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Biostatistics Unit, Department of Health Sciences, University of Genoa"}, "7006800085": {"Name": "De Stefano N.", "AuthorID": "7006800085", "AffiliationID": "60002838", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurological and Behavioural Sciences, University of Siena"}, "7202268530": {"Name": "Filippi M.", "AuthorID": "7202268530", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "34973365100": {"Name": "Rocca M.A.", "AuthorID": "34973365100", "AffiliationID": "60009622, 60082964", "AffiliationName": "Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University"}, "7102945505": {"Name": "Fazekas F.", "AuthorID": "7102945505", "AffiliationID": "60006224", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Medical University of Graz"}, "7004559324": {"Name": "Kappos L.", "AuthorID": "7004559324", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University of Basel"}}}
