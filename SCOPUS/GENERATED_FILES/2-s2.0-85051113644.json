We studied the association between multiple gait and cognitive measures in a cohort of older people. Methods: One hundred and seventy-eight cognitively healthy participants from the Whitehall II Imaging Sub-study had a detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessment, as well as an MRI scan. Spatiotemporal and variability gait measures were derived from two 10 m walks at self-selected speed. We did a linear regression analysis, entering potential confounders with backwards elimination of variables with p \u2265 0.1. The remaining variables were then entered into a second regression before doing a stepwise analysis of cognitive measures, entering variables with p < 0.05 and removing those with p \u2265 0.1. Results: Amongst absolute gait measures, only greater stride length was associated with better performance on the Trail Making Test A (p = 0.023) and the Boston Naming Test (p = 0.042). The stride time variability was associated with performance on the Trail Making Test A (p = 0.031). Age was associated with poorer walking speed (p = 0.014) and stride time (p = 0.011), female sex with shorter stride time (p = 0.000) and shorter double stance (p = 0.005). Length of full-time education was associated with faster walking speed (p = 0.012) and shorter stride time (p = 0.045), and a history of muscular-skeletal disease with slower walking speed (p = 0.01) and shorter stride length (p = 0.015). Interestingly, volume of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on FLAIR MRI images did not contribute independently to any of the gait measures (p > 0.05). Conclusions: No strong relationship between gait and non-motor cognition was observed in a cognitively healthy, high functioning sample of elderly. Nevertheless, we found some relationships with spatial, but not temporal gait which warrant further investigation. WMH made no independent contributionto gait.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognition", "Gait", "Healthy elderly", "Older adults", "Walking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cognition", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Gait", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Prospective Studies", "Walking", "Walking Speed", "Aged, 80 and over", "Gait Analysis", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Spatio-Temporal Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051113644", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Rehabilitation", "MEDI", "2742"]], "AuthorData": {"55510284400": {"Name": "Valkanova V.", "AuthorID": "55510284400", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "56990043200": {"Name": "Demnitz N.", "AuthorID": "56990043200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "23989895900": {"Name": "Zsoldos E.", "AuthorID": "23989895900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "56128285900": {"Name": "Mahmood A.", "AuthorID": "56128285900", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "7004932147": {"Name": "Ebmeier K.P.", "AuthorID": "7004932147", "AffiliationID": "60002634", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford"}, "26633873000": {"Name": "Esser P.", "AuthorID": "26633873000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "7003895377": {"Name": "Dawes H.", "AuthorID": "7003895377", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "35171535800": {"Name": "Sexton C.E.", "AuthorID": "35171535800", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "41261247900": {"Name": "Griffanti L.", "AuthorID": "41261247900", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60008323, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "9734197200": {"Name": "Singh-Manoux A.", "AuthorID": "9734197200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7004391239": {"Name": "Kivim\u00e4ki M.", "AuthorID": "7004391239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
