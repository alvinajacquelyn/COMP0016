The chemistry of nitrogen bearing molecules such as formamide or methyl isocyanate is poorly constrained. We study different chemical pathways to form and destroy these molecules from both the gas phase and grain surface chemistry. From comparison with observations of four different relevant astrophysical regions, we show that both the gas phase and grain surface chemistry are required to explain the observed abundances of these species.", "AuthorKeywords": ["astrochemistry", "ISM: molecules", "molecular processes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052724611", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57003155800": {"Name": "Qu\u00e9nard D.", "AuthorID": "57003155800", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London"}, "8866110100": {"Name": "Jim\u00e9nez-Serra I.", "AuthorID": "8866110100", "AffiliationID": "60022109", "AffiliationName": "School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7003564783": {"Name": "Viti S.", "AuthorID": "7003564783", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57140841200": {"Name": "Holdship J.", "AuthorID": "57140841200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
