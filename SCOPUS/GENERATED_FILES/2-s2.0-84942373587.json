The app displays a synchronised graphical abstraction of a programme\u2019s content in the form of a concept map. Two experiments were conducted involving participants watching an astronomy documentary with the app. The first compared watching the programme with and without the app, and the second compared non-interactive and interactive versions of the app. Understanding of the programme, cross-device gaze behaviour, and user experience of the app were assessed. Our results show that the companion app improved participants\u2019 understanding and recall of the programme. Participants were found to manage their visual attention systematically when using the companion app, and correlations were found in the way they shifted their gaze from TV screen to tablet and back in response to changes in the programme content. Increasing interaction with the app disrupted understanding of the television programme and visual attention. Participants were positive about the value of companion apps for understanding and recall of programmes, but distraction and \u2018knowing where to look\u2019 were significant concerns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multi-screen interaction", "Science learning", "Television companion apps", "Visual attention"], "IndexKeywords": ["Concept maps", "Gaze behaviours", "Multi screens", "Science learning", "Television programmes", "User experience", "Visual Attention"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942373587", "SubjectAreas": [["Hardware and Architecture", "COMP", "1708"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"]], "AuthorData": {"36165166700": {"Name": "Dowell J.", "AuthorID": "36165166700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56709052600": {"Name": "Kim H.", "AuthorID": "56709052600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55532943200": {"Name": "Anstead E.", "AuthorID": "55532943200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "26767934800": {"Name": "Malacria S.", "AuthorID": "26767934800", "AffiliationID": "60013373", "AffiliationName": "Inria"}}}
