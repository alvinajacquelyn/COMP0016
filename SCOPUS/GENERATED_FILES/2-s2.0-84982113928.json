Both AGN (direct and reprocessed) and star formation (SF) emission are needed to model their SEDs. From the SEDs and their UV-optical spectra we have estimated the masses of their black holes MBH ~ 109-1010M\u2299, their intrinsic AGN bolometric luminosities LBOL ~ (0.8-20) \u00d7 1013 L\u2299, Eddington ratios LBOL/LEdd ~ 0.1-1.1 and bolometric corrections LBOL/LX,2-10 ~ 30-500. These values are common among optically and X-ray-selected type 1 QSOs (except for RX J1249), except for the bolometric corrections, which are higher. These objects show very high far-infrared luminosities LFIR ~ (2-8) \u00d7 1012M\u2299 and star formation rates SFR ~1000M\u2299 yr-1. From their LFIR and the shape of their FIR-submm emission we have estimated star-forming dust masses of MDUST ~109M\u2299.We have found evidence of a tentative correlation between the gas column densities of the ionized absorbers detected in X-ray (NHion ) and SFR. Our computed black hole masses are amongst the most massive known.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Galaxies: evolution", "Galaxies: high-redshift", "Galaxies: star formation", "Galaxies: starburst", "Quasars: general", "Quasars: supermassive black holes"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982113928", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57194287549": {"Name": "Khan-Ali A.", "AuthorID": "57194287549", "AffiliationID": "60003879", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de F\u00edsica de Cantabria (CSIC-UC)"}, "7005307803": {"Name": "Carrera F.J.", "AuthorID": "7005307803", "AffiliationID": "60003879", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de F\u00edsica de Cantabria (CSIC-UC)"}, "9940049500": {"Name": "Mateos S.", "AuthorID": "9940049500", "AffiliationID": "60003879", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de F\u00edsica de Cantabria (CSIC-UC)"}, "8740690900": {"Name": "Page M.J.", "AuthorID": "8740690900", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "16318225700": {"Name": "Symeonidis M.", "AuthorID": "16318225700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Sussex"}, "35434253400": {"Name": "Stevens J.A.", "AuthorID": "35434253400", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire"}, "55496839500": {"Name": "Cao Orjales J.M.", "AuthorID": "55496839500", "AffiliationID": "60032760", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics Research, University of Hertfordshire"}}}
