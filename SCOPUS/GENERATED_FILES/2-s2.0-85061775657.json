This Review aims to identify factors affecting implementation of digital health interventions for people affected by psychosis or bipolar disorder. We searched seven databases and synthesised data from 26 studies using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Attitudes and beliefs about interventions were crucial factors for both staff and service users, with negative attitudes and scepticism resulting in a lack of motivation to engage with interventions or complete them. The complexity of the interventions was a barrier for people with psychiatric symptoms, low premorbid intelligence quotient, or minimal information technology skills. The accessibility and adaptability of interventions were key facilitators, but insufficient resources, finances, and staff time were barriers to implementation. Interventions need to be user friendly and adaptable to the needs and capabilities of people with psychosis or bipolar disorder, and the staff who support their implementation. Service users and staff should cofacilitate the process of developing and implementing the interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bipolar Disorder", "Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice", "Humans", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Psychotic Disorders", "Telemedicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061775657", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"13003541900": {"Name": "Aref-Adib G.", "AuthorID": "13003541900", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington National Health Service Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}, "57210417090": {"Name": "McCloud T.", "AuthorID": "57210417090", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "57190138452": {"Name": "O'Hanlon P.", "AuthorID": "57190138452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "21739574100": {"Name": "Rowe S.", "AuthorID": "21739574100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60161450, 60161451", "AffiliationName": "Camden and Islington National Health Service Foundation Trust, St Pancras Hospital"}, "57200130485": {"Name": "Appleton V.", "AuthorID": "57200130485", "AffiliationID": "60117607, 60023643, 60117724", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medicine, Furness College, Lancaster University"}, "6506642330": {"Name": "Lobban F.", "AuthorID": "6506642330", "AffiliationID": "60117607, 60023643, 60117724", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Health and Medicine, Furness College, Lancaster University"}, "57206477392": {"Name": "Ross J.", "AuthorID": "57206477392", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7202670002": {"Name": "Murray E.", "AuthorID": "7202670002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}}}
