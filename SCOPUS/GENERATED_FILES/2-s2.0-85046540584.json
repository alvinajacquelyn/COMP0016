Drawing on Williams\u2019 (Marxism and literature, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1977) notion of \u201cstructures of feeling\u201d, as well as on Woolard\u2019s (Am Ethnol 12(4):738\u2013748, 1985) critical take on the concepts of integrated linguistic market and culture hegemony, we empirically analyse individuals\u2019 engagement with normative meanings and values linked to language policies. In particular, we focus on situated practices at a secondary school located in an ethnically diverse city in southwestern China in which Tibetans constitute the largest ethnic minority group. Our data show emergent communicative forms, or \u201cstructures of feeling\u201d, through which school actors enact, challenge and shape an institutional logic that marginalises the Tibetan section within the school while constructing Tibetan language education as a pedagogical space with no room for Tibetan religious content. In so doing, our analysis sheds light on complex on-the-ground dynamics, with focus on shifting values on what constitutes appropriate knowledge and a \u201cgood\u201d minority language school vis-\u00e0-vis wider socio-institutional processes of transformation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["China", "Language policy", "Minority language education", "Structures of feeling", "Tibetan"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046540584", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"57201946790": {"Name": "Zhang J.", "AuthorID": "57201946790", "AffiliationID": "60005244", "AffiliationName": "School of Foreign Languages, Southeast University"}, "36622769900": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Milans M.", "AuthorID": "36622769900", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
