Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Inconsistent terminology and variation in service models have made synthesis of the supported accommodation literature challenging. To overcome this, we developed a brief, categorical taxonomy that aimed to capture the defining features of different supported accommodation models: the simple taxonomy for supported accommodation (STAX-SA). Data from a previous review of existing classification systems were used to develop the taxonomy structure. After initial testing and amendments, the STAX-SA and an existing taxonomy were applied to 132 supported accommodation service descriptions drawn from two systematic reviews and their performance compared. To assess external validity, the STAX-SA was distributed to a sample of supported accommodation managers in England and they were asked to use it to classify their services. The final version of the STAX-SA comprised of five supported accommodation \u2018types\u2019, based on four domains; Staffing location; Level of support; Emphasis on move-on; and Physical setting. The STAX-SA accurately categorized 71.1% (n = 94) of service descriptions, outperforming the comparison tool, and was not affected by publication date or research design. The STAX-SA effectively discriminated between \u2018real world\u2019 service models in England and 53.2% (n = 17) of service managers indicated that the taxonomy was \u2018Very effective\u2019 or \u2018Extremely effective\u2019 in capturing key characteristics of their service. The STAX-SA is an effective tool for classifying supported accommodation models and represents a promising approach to synthesizing the extant effectiveness literature. The authors recommend the development of reporting guidelines for future supported accommodation publications to facilitate comparison between models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Classification", "Mental health", "Supported accommodation", "Taxonomy"], "IndexKeywords": ["England", "Humans", "Mental Health", "Mental Health Services"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041082305", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Health, Toxicology and Mutagenesis", "ENVI", "2307"]], "AuthorData": {"57188820603": {"Name": "McPherson P.", "AuthorID": "57188820603", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London (UCL)"}, "55628773900": {"Name": "Krotofil J.", "AuthorID": "55628773900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London (UCL)"}, "6602601081": {"Name": "Killaspy H.", "AuthorID": "6602601081", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London (UCL)"}}}
