Since APP is a member of a gene family that contains two other members, amyloid precursor-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1 and APLP2), it is important to determine if the related APP proteins possess the same properties as APP with respect to their interactions with NMDA receptors. Following expression in mammalian cells, both APLP1 and APLP2 behaved similarly to APP in that they both co-immunoprecipitated with the two major NMDA receptor subtypes, GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B, via interaction with the obligatory GluN1 subunit. Immunoprecipitations from detergent extracts of adult mammalian brain showed co-immunoprecipitation of APLP1 and APLP2 with GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. Furthermore, similarly to APP, APLP1 and APLP2 both enhanced GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B cell surface expression. Thus, all the three members of the APP gene family behave similarly in that they each contribute to the regulation of cell surface NMDA receptor homoeostasis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been shown to associate with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and to enhance their cell surface expression. Here, we show that the other members of the APP family, APLP1 and APLP2, behave similarly to APP in that they both associate with assembled NMDA receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum via their interaction with the NMDA receptor subunit, GluN1 and, they enhance receptor cell surface expression. Alternative scenarios are depicted since it is to be determined if respective associations are direct.
