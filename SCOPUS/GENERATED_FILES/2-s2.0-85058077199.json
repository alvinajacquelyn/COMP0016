Mercury (Hg) is characterized by its ability to migrate between continents and its adverse effects on human health, arousing great concern around the world. The transboundary transport of large anthropogenic Hg emissions from China has attracted particular attention, especially from neighboring countries. Here, we combine an atmospheric transport model, a mass budget analysis, and a multiregional input-output model to simulate the atmospheric Hg outflow from China and investigate the impacts of Chinese interprovincial trade on the outflow. The results show outflows of 423.0 Mg of anthropogenic Hg, consisting of 65.9% of the total Chinese anthropogenic emissions, from China in 2010. Chinese interprovincial trade promotes the transfer of atmospheric outflow from the eastern terrestrial boundary (6.4 Mg year -1 ) to the western terrestrial boundary (+4.5 Mg year -1 ) and a net decrease in the atmospheric outflow for the whole boundary, reducing the chance of risks to foreign countries derived from transboundary Hg pollution from China. These impacts of interprovincial trade will be amplified due to the expected strengthened interprovincial trade in the future. The synergistic promotional effects of interprovincial trade versus Hg controls should be considered to reduce the transboundary Hg pollution from China.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anthropogenic emissions", "Atmospheric mercury", "Atmospheric transport model", "Foreign countries", "Input output model", "Mercuries (Hg)", "Promotional effect", "Trans-boundary", "Air Pollutants", "China", "Environmental Monitoring", "Humans", "Internationality", "Mercury"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058077199", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"]], "AuthorData": {"55362895000": {"Name": "Chen L.", "AuthorID": "55362895000", "AffiliationID": "60021200", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University"}, "56327161000": {"Name": "Tang X.", "AuthorID": "56327161000", "AffiliationID": "60021200", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University"}, "7102477239": {"Name": "Shu J.", "AuthorID": "7102477239", "AffiliationID": "60021200", "AffiliationName": "School of Geographic Sciences, East China Normal University"}, "36453970600": {"Name": "Liang S.", "AuthorID": "36453970600", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University"}, "57204957434": {"Name": "Li Y.", "AuthorID": "57204957434", "AffiliationID": "60023237", "AffiliationName": "State Key Joint Laboratory of Environment Simulation and Pollution Control, School of Environment, Beijing Normal University"}, "57205068435": {"Name": "Zhang Y.", "AuthorID": "57205068435", "AffiliationID": "60033100", "AffiliationName": "School of Atmospheric Sciences, Nanjing University"}, "57189870268": {"Name": "Liu M.", "AuthorID": "57189870268", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Process, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "57190491740": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57190491740", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Process, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "7501856188": {"Name": "Wang X.", "AuthorID": "7501856188", "AffiliationID": "60014966, 60001604", "AffiliationName": "Ministry of Education Laboratory of Earth Surface Process, College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge"}, "36572754800": {"Name": "Tong Y.", "AuthorID": "36572754800", "AffiliationID": "60019533", "AffiliationName": "School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tianjin University"}, "7409434486": {"Name": "Zhang W.", "AuthorID": "7409434486", "AffiliationID": "60014402", "AffiliationName": "School of Environment and Natural Resources, Renmin University of China"}}}
