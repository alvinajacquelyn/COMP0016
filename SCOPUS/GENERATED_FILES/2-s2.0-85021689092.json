Recent Findings: The incidence of the small renal mass is increasing. Standard management of the SRM is partial nephrectomy. More recently, use of ablative techniques to manage the SRM has been increasing and an exciting array of technical advances is currently being made in the field. Nephron-sparing surgery looks set to become more financially viable with the advent of newer robotic platforms and, potentially, even less invasive with the evaluation of single-port access. Real-time imaging promises to improve tumour definition, nephron preservation and vascular management intraoperatively. Summary: Advances in surgical and minimally invasive therapies for the management of the SRM have the potential to improve cancer clearance and long-term renal function preservation. Patients will experience safer, more reliable and less invasive treatments for their small renal tumours. We describe the current advances underlying these changes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ablation", "Kidney cancer", "Minimally invasive surgery", "Small renal mass"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ablation Techniques", "Humans", "Kidney Neoplasms", "Laparoscopy", "Nephrectomy", "Nephrons", "Organ Sparing Treatments", "Robotic Surgical Procedures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021689092", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"55933531900": {"Name": "Withington J.", "AuthorID": "55933531900", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57194391748": {"Name": "Neves J.B.", "AuthorID": "57194391748", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "26430478700": {"Name": "Barod R.", "AuthorID": "26430478700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Specialist Centre for Kidney Cancer, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
