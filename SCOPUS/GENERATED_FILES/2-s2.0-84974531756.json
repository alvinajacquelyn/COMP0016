By reflecting on where the potential strengths of such an approach may lie it is suggested that the most effective contributions will be made where there is a significant breadth and depth of historical sources. However, in Uganda the emphasis has tended to be on archaeological sites with distant or even dubious historical associations. The situation is further complicated by the very active processes of history making that are currently taking place, particularly in association with 'traditional' spirit worship. Nevertheless there are a range of themes and contexts which could be explored through historical archaeology and there are also plentiful archaeological resources from the twentieth century. It is concluded that there is great potential for historical archaeology but that there needs to be a readjustment of the contexts and situations that are explored.", "AuthorKeywords": ["archaeology", "colonialism", "Eastern Africa", "historiography", "Uganda"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974531756", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"]], "AuthorData": {"7202690863": {"Name": "Reid A.", "AuthorID": "7202690863", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
