We have screened a library of nearly 1500 fragments by high-throughput docking into the CBP bromodomain followed by binding energy evaluation using a force field with electrostatic solvation. Twenty of the 39 fragments selected by virtual screening are positive in one or more ligand-observed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Four crystal structures of the CBP bromodomain in complex with in silico screening hits validate the pose predicted by docking. Thus, the success ratio of the high-throughput docking procedure is 50% or 10% if one considers the validation by ligand-observed NMR spectroscopy or X-ray crystallography, respectively. Compounds 1 and 3 show favorable ligand efficiency in two different in vitro binding assays. The structure of the CBP bromodomain in the complex with the brominated pyrrole 1 suggests fragment growing by Suzuki coupling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bromodomain inhibitors", "Docking", "Epigenetics", "NMR spectroscopy", "Virtual screening", "X-ray crystallography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Benzene Derivatives", "Computer Simulation", "CREB-Binding Protein", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Drug Discovery", "Heterocyclic Compounds", "High-Throughput Screening Assays", "Hydrogen Bonding", "Ligands", "Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Protein Domains", "Small Molecule Libraries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017339537", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"56091952300": {"Name": "Spiliotopoulos D.", "AuthorID": "56091952300", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "57189223300": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "57189223300", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "57193883503": {"Name": "Deerain N.", "AuthorID": "57193883503", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "56668376600": {"Name": "Marchand J.R.", "AuthorID": "56668376600", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "7006219601": {"Name": "Caflisch A.", "AuthorID": "7006219601", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "56313360600": {"Name": "Wamhoff E.C.", "AuthorID": "56313360600", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Department of Biology, Chemistry, and Pharmacy, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "56032396800": {"Name": "Aretz J.", "AuthorID": "56032396800", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Department of Biology, Chemistry, and Pharmacy, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}, "23989670000": {"Name": "Rademacher C.", "AuthorID": "23989670000", "AffiliationID": "60030718", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Department of Biology, Chemistry, and Pharmacy, Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}}}
