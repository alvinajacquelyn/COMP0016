New techniques provide information about both the macrostructure and microstructure of bone ranging from micrometre detail to the whole skeleton. Furthermore functional information about bone physiology can be used to detect disease early before structural changes occur. The future of bone imaging is in quantifying the anatomical and functional information to diagnose and monitor disease more precisely. This review explores the state of the art in quantitative MRI bone imaging.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Biomechanical Phenomena", "Bone and Bones", "Bone Diseases", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040576206", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57183312200": {"Name": "Singh S.", "AuthorID": "57183312200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "57130300100": {"Name": "Bray T.", "AuthorID": "57130300100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "7005861491": {"Name": "Hall-Craggs M.", "AuthorID": "7005861491", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}}}
