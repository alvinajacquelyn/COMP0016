Typically, language models estimate the probability of a document generating the query, where the query is considered as a set of independent search terms. We extend this approach by considering the concepts implied by both the query and words in the document. The model combines the probability of the document generating the concept embodied by the query, and the traditional language model probability of the document generating the query terms. We use a word embedding space to express concepts. The similarity between two vectors in this space is estimated using a weighted cosine distance. The weighting significantly enhances the discrimination between vectors. We evaluate our model on benchmark datasets (TREC 6-8) and empirically demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ad-hoc retrieval", "Language model", "Word embeddings"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ad Hoc retrieval", "Benchmark datasets", "Embeddings", "Language model", "Query terms", "Search terms", "State of the art", "Word embedding"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059811638", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"57188726237": {"Name": "Zou B.", "AuthorID": "57188726237", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "36610455100": {"Name": "Lampos V.", "AuthorID": "36610455100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55631770500": {"Name": "Liang S.", "AuthorID": "55631770500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "53985046100": {"Name": "Ren Z.", "AuthorID": "53985046100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57203056765": {"Name": "Yilmaz E.", "AuthorID": "57203056765", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7101864930": {"Name": "Cox I.", "AuthorID": "7101864930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
