Methods Routine microbiology diagnosis of 95 respiratory specimens from patients with severe infection were compared with those generated by the Unyvero P55 test, which detects 20 pathogens and 19 antimicrobial resistance markers. Supplementary molecular testing for antimicrobial resistance genes, comprehensive culture methodology and 16S rRNA sequencing were performed. Results Unyvero P55 produced 85 valid results, 67% of which were concordant with those from the routine laboratory. Unyvero P55 identified more potential pathogens per specimen than routine culture (1.34 vs. 0.47 per specimen). Independent verification using 16S rRNA sequencing and culture (n = 10) corroborated 58% of additional detections compared to routine microbiology. Overall the average sensitivity for organism detection by Unyvero P55 was 88.8% and specificity was 94.9%. While Unyvero P55 detected more antimicrobial resistance markers than routine culture, some instances of phenotypic resistance were missed. Conclusions The Unyvero P55 is a rapid pathogen detection test for lower respiratory specimens, which identifies a larger number of pathogens than routine microbiology. The clinical significance of these additional organisms is yet to be determined. Further studies are required to determine the effect of the test in practise on antimicrobial prescribing and patient outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["16S metagenomics", "Antimicrobial resistance", "Diagnostics", "PCR", "Pneumonia", "Rapid testing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85021256738", "SubjectAreas": [["Structural Biology", "BIOC", "1315"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"]], "AuthorData": {"57190122149": {"Name": "Ozongwu C.", "AuthorID": "57190122149", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "55446344000": {"Name": "Personne Y.", "AuthorID": "55446344000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "56800313500": {"Name": "Platt G.", "AuthorID": "56800313500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57194623670": {"Name": "Aydin S.", "AuthorID": "57194623670", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "57216905283": {"Name": "Kozato N.", "AuthorID": "57216905283", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London, Royal Free Campus"}, "6602325251": {"Name": "Enne V.I.", "AuthorID": "6602325251", "AffiliationID": "108091009", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Research Centre"}, "57192212005": {"Name": "Jeanes C.", "AuthorID": "57192212005", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "24767991700": {"Name": "O'Grady J.", "AuthorID": "24767991700", "AffiliationID": "60117932, 60000112", "AffiliationName": "Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia"}, "35546887900": {"Name": "Gant V.", "AuthorID": "35546887900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection, University College London NHS Hospitals Foundation Trust"}}}
