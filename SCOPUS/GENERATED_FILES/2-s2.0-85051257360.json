Since neurodegenerative disorders are eventually progressive, whereas primary psychiatric disorders are not, this study aimed to investigate whether the change in clinical symptoms over time differed between groups and which biomarkers predicted rate of decline. Disease trajectories (median follow-up = 3 years) of frontal and stereotyped behaviour, general and frontal cognitive functioning, and social cognition were examined in bvFTD (n = 34), other neurodegenerative (n = 28) and primary psychiatric disorders (n = 43), all presenting with late-onset frontal lobe syndrome (45\u201375 years), using linear mixed models. To gain more insight in underlying pathological processes driving disease progression, we studied the association of baseline cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (neurofilament light (NfL) and YKL-40 levels, phosphotau 181 to total tau ratio) and neuroimaging markers with disease trajectories. Frontal behavioural symptoms (e.g., disinhibition, apathy) worsened over time in bvFTD, whereas they improved in psychiatric disorders and remained stable in other neurodegenerative disorders. General and frontal cognitive decline was observed in bvFTD and other neurodegenerative disorders, but not in psychiatric disorders. None of the groups showed change in stereotypy and social cognition. For all diagnostic groups, higher CSF NfL levels were associated with faster frontal cognitive decline. A modest association was observed between caudate volume and stereotyped behaviour. Tracking frontal behavioural symptoms and cognition has potential to distinguish bvFTD from other disorders. CSF NfL levels seem to be associated with decline in frontal cognitive functioning.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD)", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Cortical thickness", "Disease trajectories", "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)", "Subcortical volumes"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Apathy", "Cognition Disorders", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Frontotemporal Dementia", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Longitudinal Studies", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Stereotyped Behavior"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051257360", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"57193263208": {"Name": "Reus L.M.", "AuthorID": "57193263208", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdan UMC"}, "57189217363": {"Name": "Vijverberg E.G.", "AuthorID": "57189217363", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdan UMC"}, "57204782423": {"Name": "Tijms B.M.", "AuthorID": "57204782423", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdan UMC"}, "57188682958": {"Name": "Kate M.t.", "AuthorID": "57188682958", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdan UMC"}, "52863842700": {"Name": "Krudop W.A.", "AuthorID": "52863842700", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "van der Flier W.M.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdan UMC"}, "7101761148": {"Name": "Visser P.J.", "AuthorID": "7101761148", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Maastricht University"}, "6601957110": {"Name": "Pijnenburg Y.A.", "AuthorID": "6601957110", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdan UMC"}, "55978739700": {"Name": "Gossink F.", "AuthorID": "55978739700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry"}, "55565174300": {"Name": "Dols A.", "AuthorID": "55565174300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Old Age Psychiatry"}, "57203315438": {"Name": "Campo M.d.", "AuthorID": "57203315438", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Lab and Biobank, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "6701704380": {"Name": "Teunissen C.E.", "AuthorID": "6701704380", "AffiliationID": "60008734, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Neurochemistry Lab and Biobank, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institutes of Neurology and Healthcare Engineering, UCL"}}}
