Published by Elsevier Ltd.The long winter time and the harsh outdoor environment cause many inconveniences of the outdoor activities to urban residents in severe cold areas. Therefore, it is urgent to study and improve the thermal environment in urban residential streets. This paper focuses on winter thermal environment of streets in open communities of northern China, by carrying out field measurements according to the characteristics of cold climate and urban residential areas. The results show that the aspect ratios of streets can directly affect their thermal environment. With the aspect ratio increases, the air temperature decreases and the wind speed increases. At the same time, facade openings can make the average globe temperature significantly increased in the streets. This paper provides basic data for the further study of thermal environment in urban streets and the optimization design of street spaces. .", "AuthorKeywords": ["northern china", "open community", "streets", "thermal environment", "winter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Northern China", "open community", "Optimization design", "Outdoor activities", "Outdoor environment", "Thermal environment", "Urban residential areas", "winter"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032573260", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57196299037": {"Name": "Jin Y.", "AuthorID": "57196299037", "AffiliationID": "118089046", "AffiliationName": "Heilongjiang Cold Region Architectural Science Key Laboratory"}, "55485135500": {"Name": "Kang J.", "AuthorID": "55485135500", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "School of Architecture, University of Sheffield, Western Bank"}, "27168583800": {"Name": "Jin H.", "AuthorID": "27168583800", "AffiliationID": "118089046", "AffiliationName": "Heilongjiang Cold Region Architectural Science Key Laboratory"}, "57196287696": {"Name": "Zhao J.", "AuthorID": "57196287696", "AffiliationID": "118089046", "AffiliationName": "Heilongjiang Cold Region Architectural Science Key Laboratory"}}}
