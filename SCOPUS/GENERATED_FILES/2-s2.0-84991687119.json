We call a curve \u03b3 in \u211dd (\u2264k)-crossing if it intersects every hyperplane at most k times (counted with multiplicity). The (\u2264d)-crossing curves in \u211dd are often called convex curves and they form an important class; a primary example is the moment curve {(t, t2, . . . , td) : t \u2208 [0, 1]}. They are also closely related to Chebyshev systems, which is a notion of considerable importance, e.g., in approximation theory. Our main result is that for every d there is M = M(d) such that every (\u2264d+1)-crossing curve in \u211dd can be subdivided into at most M (\u2264d)-crossing curve segments. As a consequence, based on the work of Eli\u00e1\u0161, Rold\u00e1n, Safernov\u00e1, and the second author, we obtain an essentially tight lower bound for a geometric Ramsey-type problem in \u211dd concerning order-type homogeneous sequences of points, investigated in several previous papers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chebyshev system", "Convex curve", "Moment curve", "Order type", "Ramsey function"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991687119", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"7005223038": {"Name": "B\u00e1r\u00e1ny I.", "AuthorID": "7005223038", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "35599272200": {"Name": "Matou\u0161ek J.", "AuthorID": "35599272200", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "6602600705": {"Name": "P\u00f3r A.", "AuthorID": "6602600705", "AffiliationID": "60014611", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, Western Kentucky University"}}}
