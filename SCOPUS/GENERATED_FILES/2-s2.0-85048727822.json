Methods: This observational study recruited extremely preterm (EP, <26 weeks\u2019 gestation; n=102, 60% female) and term-born controls (TC; n=48) aged 18\u201320 yr from the UK EPICure cohort. Thirty EP but no TC participants had neonatal surgery. Evaluation included: quantitative sensory testing (thenar eminence, chest wall); clinical pain history; questionnaires (intelligence quotient; pain catastrophising; anxiety); and structural brain imaging. Results: Reduced thermal threshold sensitivity in EP vs TC participants persisted at age 18\u201320 yr. Sex-dependent effects varied with stimulus intensity and were enhanced by neonatal surgery, with reduced threshold sensitivity in EP surgery males but increased sensitivity to prolonged noxious cold in EP surgery females (P<0.01). Sex-dependent differences in thermal sensitivity correlated with smaller amygdala volume (P<0.05) but not current intelligence quotient. While generalised decreased sensitivity encompassed mechanical and thermal modalities in EP surgery males, a mixed pattern of sensory loss and sensory gain persisted adjacent to neonatal scars in males and females. More EP participants reported moderate\u2013severe recurrent pain (22/101 vs 4/48; \u03c72=0.04) and increased pain intensity correlated with higher anxiety and pain catastrophising. Conclusions: After preterm birth and neonatal surgery, different patterns of generalised and local scar-related alterations in somatosensory function persist into early adulthood. Sex-dependent changes in generalised sensitivity may reflect central modulation by affective circuits. Early life experience and sex/gender should be considered when evaluating somatosensory function, pain experience, or future chronic pain risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["extremely Preterm", "Infant", "Pain", "Quantitative sensory testing", "surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Cognition", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Infant, Extremely Premature", "Infant, Newborn", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Neurodevelopmental Disorders", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Pain", "Premature Birth", "Sensory Thresholds", "Sex Factors", "Somatosensory Cortex", "Surgical Procedures, Operative", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048727822", "SubjectAreas": [["Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine", "MEDI", "2703"]], "AuthorData": {"8753106000": {"Name": "Walker S.M.", "AuthorID": "8753106000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesia and Pain Medicine, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Foundation Trust"}, "22980645100": {"Name": "Melbourne A.", "AuthorID": "22980645100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55890955800": {"Name": "Eaton-Rosen Z.", "AuthorID": "55890955800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "37026799300": {"Name": "O'Reilly H.", "AuthorID": "37026799300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neonatology, EGA UCL Institute for Women's Health"}, "57020993700": {"Name": "Beckmann J.", "AuthorID": "57020993700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neonatology, EGA UCL Institute for Women's Health"}, "7006171979": {"Name": "Marlow N.", "AuthorID": "7006171979", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Academic Neonatology, EGA UCL Institute for Women's Health"}}}
