Skin diseases can be a result of multi-systemic disease or an isolated condition. Due to its proteolysis resistant properties there are relatively few human skin proteomic datasets published compared with other human organs or body fluids. Skin is a challenging tissue to analyse using traditional proteomic techniques due to its high lipid content, insolubility and extensive cross-linking of proteins. This can complicate the isolation and digestion of proteins for analysis using mass spectrometry techniques. Results: We have optimised a sample preparation procedure to improve solubilisation and mass spectral compatibility of full thickness skin samples. Using this technique, we were able to obtain data for the proteome profile of full thickness human skin using on-line two-dimensional liquid chromatography, followed by ultra-high definition label-free mass spectrometry analysis (UDMSE). We were able to identify in excess of 2000 proteins from a full thickness skin sample. Conclusions: The adoption of on-line fractionation and optimised acquisition protocols utilising ion mobility separation (IMS) technology has significantly increased the scope for protein identifications ten-fold.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Mass spectrometry", "Proteomics", "Skin profiling", "Solubilisation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978915476", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"56989017700": {"Name": "Bliss E.", "AuthorID": "56989017700", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "56458521200": {"Name": "Heywood W.E.", "AuthorID": "56458521200", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7202875406": {"Name": "Mills K.", "AuthorID": "7202875406", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57190282425": {"Name": "Benatti M.", "AuthorID": "57190282425", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7004794073": {"Name": "Sebire N.J.", "AuthorID": "7004794073", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Histopathology Department, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
