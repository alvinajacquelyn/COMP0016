Systematic reviews focus on quantitative studies and there is a lack of qualitative reviews in the area. The review aimed to address this gap by exploring what existing qualitative studies reveal about the implementation, effects and processes of psychosocial interventions for dementia.Method: A systematic literature search was conducted, identifying 363 studies. Sixteen studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria and assessed for quality using pre-specified criteria. Thematic analysis was used to synthesise the findings.Results: There were 10 descriptive themes. Despite the diversity of the psychosocial interventions, there were common themes in relation to (1) contextual and individual factors affecting implementation (2) perceived impact of the interventions and (3) the processes active in achieving these effects. Study quality was adequate but variable.Conclusion: Common processes may underlie different psychosocial interventions for dementia. The synthesis of qualitative findings can offer insight into what makes interventions work and factors which may facilitate or impede their use.", "AuthorKeywords": ["dementia", "psychosocial interventions", "qualitative methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cognitive Therapy", "Dementia", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Qualitative Research", "Quality of Life", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938956623", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36979736800": {"Name": "Dugmore O.", "AuthorID": "36979736800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7203039292": {"Name": "Spector A.", "AuthorID": "7203039292", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College London"}}}
