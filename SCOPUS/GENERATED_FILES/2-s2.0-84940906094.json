The EPR Family provides data on ethnic groups\u2019 access to state power, their settlement patterns, links to rebel organizations, transborder ethnic kin relations, and intraethnic cleavages. The new 2014 version does not only extend the data set\u2019s temporal coverage from 2009 to 2013, but it also offers several new features, such as a new measure of regional autonomy that is independent of national-level executive power and a new data set component coding intraethnic identities and cleavages. Moreover, for the first time, detailed documentation of the EPR data is provided through the EPR Atlas. This article presents these novelties in detail and compares the EPR Family 2014 to the most relevant alternative data sets on ethnicity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["civil wars", "conflict", "internal armed conflict", "power"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940906094", "SubjectAreas": [["Business, Management and Accounting (all)", "BUSI", "1400"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"]], "AuthorData": {"56513312500": {"Name": "Vogt M.", "AuthorID": "56513312500", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Center for Comparative and International Studies, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "55603575000": {"Name": "Bormann N.", "AuthorID": "55603575000", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Center for Comparative and International Studies, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "56820141600": {"Name": "R\u00fcegger S.", "AuthorID": "56820141600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Center for Comparative and International Studies, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "6602313667": {"Name": "Cederman L.", "AuthorID": "6602313667", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Center for Comparative and International Studies, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "56819902600": {"Name": "Hunziker P.", "AuthorID": "56819902600", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Center for Comparative and International Studies, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "57191351396": {"Name": "Girardin L.", "AuthorID": "57191351396", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Center for Comparative and International Studies, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}}}
