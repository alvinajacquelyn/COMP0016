Therefore, collecting patient information and knowledge management is of paramount importance. General practitioners (GPS) are well placed to lead these evolving models of care delivery. However, it is unclear how they are handling these changes. To gain an insight into this matter, the HIV epidemic was chosen as a test case. Methods Data were collected and analysed from 13 semi-structured interviews with GPS, working in urban communities in Flanders. Findings GPS use various types of patient information to estimate patients' risk of HIV. The way in which sexual health information is collected and registered, depends on the type of information under discussion. General patient information and medical history data are often automatically collected and registered. Proactively collecting sexual health information is uncommon. Moreover, the registration of the latter is not obvious, mostly owing to insufficient space in the electronic medical record (EMR). Conclusions GPS seem willing to systematically collect and register sexual health information, in particular about HIV-risk factors. They expressed a need for guidance together with practical adjustments of the EMR to adequately capture and share this information.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Key words communication in health care", "proactive sexual health", "sensitive information", "sexual risk behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Belgium", "Electronic Health Records", "Evaluation Studies as Topic", "Female", "General Practitioners", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Reproductive Health", "Urban Health Services"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84981287677", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Care Planning", "NURS", "2904"]], "AuthorData": {"57194635376": {"Name": "Vos J.", "AuthorID": "57194635376", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Ghent University"}, "37081722900": {"Name": "Pype P.", "AuthorID": "37081722900", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Ghent University"}, "56282627700": {"Name": "Aelbrecht K.", "AuthorID": "56282627700", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Ghent University"}, "6603647310": {"Name": "Deveugele M.", "AuthorID": "6603647310", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Ghent University"}, "7003629113": {"Name": "Avonts D.", "AuthorID": "7003629113", "AffiliationID": "60002614, 60033316", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, Ghent University"}, "16309005000": {"Name": "Deblonde J.", "AuthorID": "16309005000", "AffiliationID": "60068592", "AffiliationName": "Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health"}, "57190567543": {"Name": "Van Den Eynde S.", "AuthorID": "57190567543", "AffiliationID": "60099099", "AffiliationName": "Sensoa"}}}
