We sought to clarify the impact of SSRIs on ICrH, accounting for study methodology. Patients and methods: A comprehensive search of Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library from 1960 to December 2017 identified studies comparing SSRIs with control. The outcomes (first-ever and recurrent ICrH) were meta-analysed using a random effects model. Results: Twenty-four observational studies and three randomised trials were available for meta-analysis, totalling 4,844,090 patient-years of follow-up. Those receiving SSRIs were more likely to be female (p = 0.01) and have depression (p < 0.001). Compared to controls, SSRI users had a significantly increased risk of ICrH (relative risk (RR) 1.26, 95%CI 1.11\u20131.42). Although SSRI use was associated with increased ICrH risk in those without previous ICrH (RR 1.31, 95%CI 1.15\u20131.48), this was not the case in those with previous ICrH (RR 0.95, 95%CI 0.83\u20131.09). Sensitivity analysis according to the bleeding definition reported demonstrated that although \u2018haemorrhagic stroke\u2019 was associated with SSRIs (RR 1.40, 95%CI 1.13\u20131.72), intracerebral haemorrhage was not (RR 1.11, 95%CI 0.86\u20131.42). Additional sensitivity analyses demonstrated a stronger association between SSRIs and ICrH in studies with a high (p < 0.001) compared to low risk of bias (p = 0.09) and with retrospective (p < 0.001) compared to prospective (p=0.31) study designs. Discussion: Although SSRIs are associated with an increased risk of ICrH, the association is partly accounted for by important biases and other methodological limitations in the available observational data. Conclusion: Our findings suggest there is insufficient high-quality data to advise restriction of SSRIs because of concern regarding ICrH risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["haemorrhagic stroke", "intracranial haemorrhage", "meta-analysis", "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor", "systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060676344", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57205598735": {"Name": "Jensen M.P.", "AuthorID": "57205598735", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "55263618500": {"Name": "Ziff O.J.", "AuthorID": "55263618500", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57130290000": {"Name": "Banerjee G.", "AuthorID": "57130290000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "6603707621": {"Name": "Werring D.J.", "AuthorID": "6603707621", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Stroke Research Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology and the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003730066": {"Name": "Ambler G.", "AuthorID": "7003730066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, UCL"}}}
