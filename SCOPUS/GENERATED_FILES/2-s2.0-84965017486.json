We test this proposition against various post-1900 British or uk church adherence data and find no evidence to support the claim. On the contrary, the trajectories of decline are remarkably smooth. We suggest that such smoothness better supports the sociological view of secularization as a long-run process with amorphous and deep causes than it supports the claim that religious change is a response to specific events.", "AuthorKeywords": ["crises", "Crisis", "religious resurgence", "religious revival", "secularization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84965017486", "SubjectAreas": [["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"]], "AuthorData": {"57214720289": {"Name": "Bruce S.", "AuthorID": "57214720289", "AffiliationID": "60015875", "AffiliationName": "University of Aberdeen"}, "6603640355": {"Name": "Voas D.", "AuthorID": "6603640355", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
