The problems are:1.Passive observations in spacetime: consider observations in an open set V\u2282 M. The light observation set corresponding to a point source at q\u2208 M is the intersection of V and the light-cone emanating from the point q.Let W\u2282 M be an unknown open, relatively compact set. We show that under natural causality conditions, the family of light observation sets corresponding to point sources at points q\u2208 W determine uniquely the conformal type of W.2.Active measurements in spacetime: we develop a new method for inverse problems for non-linear hyperbolic equations that utilizes the non-linearity as a tool. This enables us to solve inverse problems for non-linear equations for which the corresponding problems for linear equations are still unsolved. To illustrate this method, we solve an inverse problem for semilinear wave equations with quadratic non-linearities. We assume that we are given the neighborhood V of the time-like path \u03bc and the source-to-solution operator that maps the source supported on V to the restriction of the solution of the wave equation to V. When M is 4-dimensional, we show that these data determine the topological, differentiable, and conformal structures of the spacetime in the maximal set where waves can propagate from \u03bc and return back to \u03bc.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042784453", "SubjectAreas": [["Mathematics (all)", "MATH", "2600"]], "AuthorData": {"6602606312": {"Name": "Kurylev Y.", "AuthorID": "6602606312", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}, "6604064173": {"Name": "Lassas M.", "AuthorID": "6604064173", "AffiliationID": "60002952", "AffiliationName": "University of Helsinki"}, "7004576662": {"Name": "Uhlmann G.", "AuthorID": "7004576662", "AffiliationID": "60015481", "AffiliationName": "University of Washington"}}}
