Elevated expression and activity of Rho kinase (ROCK) contributes to the development of DCM. ROCK targets several sarcomeric proteins including myosin light chain 2, myosin binding protein-C (MyBP-C), troponin I (TnI) and troponin T that all have important roles in regulating CB dynamics and contractility of the myocardium. Our aim was to examine if chronic ROCK inhibition prevents impaired CB dynamics and LV dysfunction in a rat model of early diabetes, and whether these changes are associated with changes in myofilament phosphorylation state. Methods: Seven days post-diabetes induction (65 mg/kg ip, streptozotocin), diabetic rats received the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil (10 mg/kg/day ip) or vehicle for 14 days. Rats underwent cardiac catheterization to assess LV function simultaneous with X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation to assess in situ CB dynamics. Results: Compared to controls, diabetic rats developed mild systolic and diastolic dysfunction, which was attenuated by fasudil. End-diastolic and systolic myosin proximity to actin filaments were significantly reduced in diabetic rats (P < 0.05). In all rats there was an inverse correlation between ROCK1 expression and the extension of myosin CB in diastole, with the lowest ROCK expression in control and fasudil-treated diabetic rats. In diabetic and fasudil-treated diabetic rats changes in relative phosphorylation of TnI and MyBP-C were not significant from controls. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate a clear role for ROCK in the development of LV dysfunction and impaired CB dynamics in early DCM.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diabetes", "Diabetic cardiomyopathy", "Myocardium", "Rho-kinase", "Sarcomere", "Small angle X-ray scattering"], "IndexKeywords": ["1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine", "Actins", "Animals", "Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetic Cardiomyopathies", "Male", "Myocardial Contraction", "Myocardium", "Myosins", "Phosphorylation", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "rho-Associated Kinases", "Signal Transduction", "Time Factors", "Ventricular Dysfunction, Left", "Ventricular Function, Left"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937239536", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55813027700": {"Name": "Waddingham M.T.", "AuthorID": "55813027700", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60001522", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "6603194713": {"Name": "Edgley A.J.", "AuthorID": "6603194713", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, Monash University"}, "7403137489": {"Name": "Kelly D.J.", "AuthorID": "7403137489", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60001522", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, St. Vincent's Hospital, University of Melbourne"}, "7401927924": {"Name": "Pearson J.T.", "AuthorID": "7401927924", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "Monash Biomedical Imaging Facility, Monash University"}, "55985279700": {"Name": "Astolfo A.", "AuthorID": "55985279700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College of London"}, "23993553200": {"Name": "Inagaki T.", "AuthorID": "23993553200", "AffiliationID": "60016372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Physiology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute"}, "45261092200": {"Name": "Fujii Y.", "AuthorID": "45261092200", "AffiliationID": "60016372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Physiology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute"}, "7202172774": {"Name": "Du C.K.", "AuthorID": "7202172774", "AffiliationID": "60016372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Physiology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute"}, "18134850400": {"Name": "Zhan D.Y.", "AuthorID": "18134850400", "AffiliationID": "60016372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Physiology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute"}, "7003320538": {"Name": "Tsuchimochi H.", "AuthorID": "7003320538", "AffiliationID": "60016372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Physiology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute"}, "7202109621": {"Name": "Shirai M.", "AuthorID": "7202109621", "AffiliationID": "60016372", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiac Physiology, National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center Research Institute"}, "7102277714": {"Name": "Yagi N.", "AuthorID": "7102277714", "AffiliationID": "60021193", "AffiliationName": "Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute"}}}
