The most frequently used cell is mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have been used largely for their anti-inflammatory actions and in situations of tissue repair and although they have demonstrated a good safety profile, their therapeutic efficacy has been limited. In addition to these characteristics MSCs are being used for their homing and engraftment properties and have been genetically modified to enable targeted delivery of a variety of therapeutic agents in both malignant and nonmalignant conditions. This review discusses the science and technology behind genetically modified MSC therapy in malignant disease and how potential problems have been overcome to enable their use in two novel clinical trials in metastatic gastrointestinal and lung cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Genetic Therapy", "Humans", "Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Neoplasms", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992381927", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"]], "AuthorData": {"24554447800": {"Name": "Sage E.K.", "AuthorID": "24554447800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lungs for Living Research Centre, UCL Respiratory, Rayne Institute, University College London"}, "57189848085": {"Name": "Thakrar R.M.", "AuthorID": "57189848085", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Thoracic Medicine, University College London Hospital"}, "56514246800": {"Name": "Janes S.M.", "AuthorID": "56514246800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Thoracic Medicine, University College London Hospital"}}}
