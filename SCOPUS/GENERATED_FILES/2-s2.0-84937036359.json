Here we describe a 63 year old HIV-infected woman who had a history, neuropsychological test result, and PET examination consistent with characteristic Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profile was analogous to the profile typically found in AD in HIV-negative patients with increased t-tau and p-tau, a decreased level of A\u03b242 and normal levels of CSF neurofilament light protein and sAPPa\u03b1 and sAPP\u03b2, distinctly different from findings in HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Assessment of CSF biomarkers may be a valuable tool for clinicians to distinguish between HAD and AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "CSF biomarkers", "HIV"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937036359", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"8136883100": {"Name": "M\u00e4kitalo S.", "AuthorID": "8136883100", "AffiliationID": "60033043", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e4vle Hospital, Department of Infectious Diseases"}, "22634843400": {"Name": "Mellgren \u00c5.", "AuthorID": "22634843400", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Department of Infectious Diseases"}, "57201969798": {"Name": "Gissl\u00e9n M.", "AuthorID": "57201969798", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Department of Infectious Diseases"}, "56721301100": {"Name": "Borgh E.", "AuthorID": "56721301100", "AffiliationID": "60031699, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "University of Gothenburg, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Department of Respiratory Medicine"}, "6601967330": {"Name": "Kilander L.", "AuthorID": "6601967330", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Uppsala University, Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences/Geriatrics"}, "55345176500": {"Name": "Skillb\u00e4ck T.", "AuthorID": "55345176500", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
