The solution requires a trade-off between exploitation and exploration since with the limited recommendation opportunities, we need to, on one hand, allocate the most relevant resources right away, but, on the other hand, it is also necessary to allocate resources that are useful for learning the target's properties in order to recommend more relevant ones in the future. In this paper, we study a simple two-stage recommendation combining a sequential and a batch solution together. We first model the problem with the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and provide its exact solution. Then, through an in-depth analysis over the POMDP value iteration solution, we identify that an exact solution can be abstracted as selecting resources that are not only highly relevant to the target according to the initial-stage information, but also highly correlated, either positively or negatively, with other potential resources for the next stage. With this finding, we propose an approximate solution to ease the intractability of the exact solution. Our initial results on synthetic data and the MovieLens 100K dataset confirm our theoretical development and analysis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cold-start problem", "Collaborative filtering", "POMDP", "Recommender systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approximate solution", "Cold start problems", "Exploitation and explorations", "Partially observable Markov decision process", "POMDP", "Potential resources", "Theoretical development", "Theoretical framework"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964380607", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science (miscellaneous)", "COMP", "1701"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"55364823600": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "55364823600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "55902731900": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "55902731900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
