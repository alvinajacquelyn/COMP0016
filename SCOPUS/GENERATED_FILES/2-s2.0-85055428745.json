Our approach is categorical: we describe the layers of our construct as monads, and combine them using distributive laws. Finding such laws is known to be difficult and our method identifies precise sufficient conditions for two monads to distribute. We either (i) concretely build a distributive law which then provides a monad structure to the composition of layers, or (ii) pinpoint the algebraic obstacles to the existence of a distributive law and suggest a weakening of one layer that ensures distributivity. This method can be applied to a step-by-step construction of a programming language. Our running example will involve three layers: a basic imperative language enriched first by adding non-determinism and then probabilistic choice. The first extension works seamlessly, but the second encounters an obstacle, resulting in an \u2018approximate\u2019 language very similar to the probabilistic network specification language ProbNetKAT.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algebraic structures", "Distributive laws", "Distributivity", "Imperative languages", "Modular methods", "Non Determinism", "Probabilistic choices", "Probabilistic network"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85055428745", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"52463256900": {"Name": "Dahlqvist F.", "AuthorID": "52463256900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57188714703": {"Name": "Parlant L.", "AuthorID": "57188714703", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "23398564400": {"Name": "Silva A.", "AuthorID": "23398564400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
