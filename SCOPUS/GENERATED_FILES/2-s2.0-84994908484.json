While correction of strabismus may improve quality of life, this is not always the case, even if realignment surgery is clinically successful. Surgeons need to understand patients' expectations of postsurgical outcomes and the impact surgery has on their psychosocial well-being. Methods This was a prospective cross-sectional study of 220 adult patients undergoing strabismus surgery at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. Clinical assessments were performed before surgery and again 2 weeks and 3 months after surgery. Standardized psychological questionnaires were completed preoperatively and 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Results Of 220 patients included in the study (mean age, 45 years), 54% were female, 81% were white, and 58.6% had a concomitant deviation. Prior to surgery, 24% of study participants were experiencing clinical levels of anxiety; 11% were suffering clinical levels of depression. Quality of life improved and anxiety and depression were reduced after surgery. Approximately 6% of the sample regretted having undergone surgery either at 3 or 6 months after treatment. Conclusions It is important to identify patients who are experiencing significant psychosocial distress and to assess their postsurgical expectations in order to improve the outcomes of strabismus surgery. Presurgical psychosocial support should be considered for these patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Anxiety Disorders", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mood Disorders", "Oculomotor Muscles", "Ophthalmologic Surgical Procedures", "Prospective Studies", "Quality of Life", "Strabismus", "Stress, Physiological", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994908484", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"55463366200": {"Name": "Adams G.G.W.", "AuthorID": "55463366200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7202720604": {"Name": "MacKenzie K.", "AuthorID": "7202720604", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "14039221400": {"Name": "Hancox J.", "AuthorID": "14039221400", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "11439021900": {"Name": "Ezra D.G.", "AuthorID": "11439021900", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55251873500": {"Name": "McBain H.", "AuthorID": "55251873500", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University"}, "55808072084": {"Name": "Newman S.P.", "AuthorID": "55808072084", "AffiliationID": "60025704", "AffiliationName": "City University"}}}
