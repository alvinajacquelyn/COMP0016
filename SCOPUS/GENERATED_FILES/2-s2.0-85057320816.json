Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy in relapsed B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (B-ALL) and B-cell Non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma including in patients who are refractory to chemotherapy. This review summarises the development and design of Blinatumomab, the outcome of clinical studies demonstrating its efficacy and how to manage the administration, practically, including relevant toxicities. We compare and contrast it to other emerging agents for treatment of B-cell malignancies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute lymphoblastic Leukaemia", "B-cell non hodgkin Lymphoma", "blinatumomab", "immunotherapeutics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antibodies, Bispecific", "Antigens, CD19", "Antineoplastic Agents", "B-Lymphocytes", "Clinical Trials as Topic", "Disease Models, Animal", "Drug Development", "Humans", "Immunotherapy", "Lymphoma, B-Cell", "Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin", "Mice", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "T-Lymphocytes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057320816", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"57204818667": {"Name": "Burt R.", "AuthorID": "57204818667", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "7102396522": {"Name": "Fielding A.K.", "AuthorID": "7102396522", "AffiliationID": "60109234", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute"}, "57115496100": {"Name": "Warcel D.", "AuthorID": "57115496100", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "UCLH"}}}
