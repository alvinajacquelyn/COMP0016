The implications of ABR are viewed historically through the conceptual lens of two governance continua\u2013market/public (economic) and centralised/devolved (political). The research, involving repeated interviews with a range of FE social partners over a three-year period, developed the concept of two inter-related logics\u2013a dominant \u2018Logic A\u2019 focused on FE college viability and merger and a subordinate \u2018Logic B\u2019 focused on regional skills strategies and greater collaboration between social partners. The significance of ABRs is assessed in relation to the wider English policy contexts that point to a need for greater skills coordination. At the same time, a comparison of ABRs in England with the \u2018regionalisation\u2019 of FE colleges in the other three countries of the UK highlights its relatively unplanned character. The article concludes with a discussion around the evolving relationship between the two Logics and argues that, albeit hesitantly, FE colleges in England may be moving towards a \u2018Post-Incorporation\u2019 phase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["devolution", "Further education colleges", "regions and localities", "skills", "technical and vocational education", "UK comparisons"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065306049", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"6603348633": {"Name": "Spours K.", "AuthorID": "6603348633", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "8147973500": {"Name": "Hodgson A.", "AuthorID": "8147973500", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57202305010": {"Name": "Grainger P.", "AuthorID": "57202305010", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}, "57212224151": {"Name": "Smith D.", "AuthorID": "57212224151", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Education"}}}
