We included 52 posterior cortical atrophy, 29 logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, 53 early-onset and 42 late-onset AD patients, selected for abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-amyloid-beta42, with CSF and magnetic resonance imaging data available. Bootstrapping revealed no differences in the prevalence of abnormal CSF total-tau and phosphorylated-tau between probable AD variants (range total-tau: 84.9%-92.3%, phosphorylated-tau: 79.2%-93.1%, p > 0.05). Voxelwise linear regressions showed various relationships between lower CSF-A\u03b242 and syndrome-specific atrophy, involving precuneus, posterior cingulate, and medial temporal lobe in early-onset AD, occipital cortex and middle temporal gyrus in posterior cortical atrophy; anterior cingulate, insular cortex and precentral gyrus (left > right) in logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia; and medial temporal lobe, thalamus, and temporal pole in late-onset AD (all at p < 0.001 uncorrected). In contrast, CSF-tau was not related to gray matter atrophy in any group. Our findings suggest that lower CSF-amyloid-beta42 - and not increased total-tau and phosphorylated-tau - relates to reduced gray matter volumes, mostly in regions that are typically atrophied in distinct clinical variants of probable AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amyloid", "Atrophy", "Cerebrospinal fluid", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Atrophy", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Female", "Gray Matter", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Peptide Fragments", "Severity of Illness Index", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84952637054", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"40462134000": {"Name": "Ossenkoppele R.", "AuthorID": "40462134000", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "56084814900": {"Name": "Rabinovici G.", "AuthorID": "56084814900", "AffiliationID": "60025038", "AffiliationName": "Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California Berkeley"}, "6601957110": {"Name": "Pijnenburg Y.", "AuthorID": "6601957110", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center"}, "7007073571": {"Name": "Scheltens P.", "AuthorID": "7007073571", "AffiliationID": "60013779, 60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Alzheimer Center, VU University Medical Center"}, "8548678900": {"Name": "van der Flier W.", "AuthorID": "8548678900", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center"}, "23005631700": {"Name": "Mattsson N.", "AuthorID": "23005631700", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Laboratory of Clinical Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg"}, "6701704380": {"Name": "Teunissen C.", "AuthorID": "6701704380", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center"}}}
