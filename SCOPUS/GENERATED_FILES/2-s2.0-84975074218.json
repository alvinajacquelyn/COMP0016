The method proceeds from photoacoustic tomography by taking the estimated initial pressure distributions as data and estimating the absolute values of the optical parameters. Therefore, both the data and the noise of the second (optical) inverse problem are affected by the method applied to solve the first (acoustic) inverse problem. In this work, the Bayesian approach for quantitative photoacoustic tomography is taken. Modelling of noise and errors and incorporating their statistics into the solution of the inverse problem are investigated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian methods", "inverse problems", "Photoacoustic tomography", "quantitative imaging"], "IndexKeywords": ["Absolute values", "Bayesian approaches", "Bayesian methods", "Optical parameter", "Photoacoustic image", "Photoacoustic tomography", "Quantitative imaging"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975074218", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"8283868000": {"Name": "Tarvainen T.", "AuthorID": "8283868000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "35369220800": {"Name": "Pulkkinen A.", "AuthorID": "35369220800", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7005049501": {"Name": "Kaipio J.", "AuthorID": "7005049501", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University of Auckland, Auckland Mail Centre"}, "7005759823": {"Name": "Arridge S.", "AuthorID": "7005759823", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7403198742": {"Name": "Cox B.", "AuthorID": "7403198742", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}}}
