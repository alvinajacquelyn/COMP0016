We first consider the classical small- deflection (Euler-Bernoulli) beam case, where we look at tip vibrations of a cantilever as a model for a barreled launch system. Then we develop a theory for large deformations based on Cosserat rod theory. We illustrate the effect of moving loads on large-deformation structures with a few cable and arch problems. Large deformations are found to have a resonance detuning effect on the cable. For the arch we find different failure modes depending on its depth: a shallow arch fails by in-plane collapse, while a deep arch fails by sideways flopping. In both cases the speed of the traversing load is found to have a stabilising effect on the structure, with failure suppressed entirely at sufficiently high speed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cosserat rod theories", "Deformation structure", "Elastic structures", "Euler-Bernoulli", "Launch system", "Resonance detuning", "Shallow arch", "Small deflection"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978110508", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56170335400": {"Name": "Zhao X.", "AuthorID": "56170335400", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics, Tongji University"}, "7005973659": {"Name": "Van Der Heijden G.", "AuthorID": "7005973659", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, University College London"}, "55649826700": {"Name": "Hu Z.", "AuthorID": "55649826700", "AffiliationID": "60073652", "AffiliationName": "School of Aerospace Engineering and Applied Mechanics, Tongji University"}}}
