To date, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been used widely, highlighting differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) between preterm infants at term and healthy term controls; altered white matter development associated with a number of perinatal risk factors; and correlations between FA values in the white matter in the neonatal period and subsequent neurodevelopmental outcome. Recent developments, including neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and fixel-based analysis (FBA), enable white matter microstructure to be assessed in detail. Constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) enables multiple fibre populations in an imaging voxel to be resolved and allows delineation of fibres that traverse regions of fibre-crossings, such as the arcuate fasciculus and cerebellar\u2013cortical pathways. This review summarises DTI findings in the preterm brain and discusses initial findings in this population using CSD, NODDI, and FBA.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain", "Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging", "Infant"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Infant, Premature", "Neuroimaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056784615", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"57195057007": {"Name": "Pecheva D.", "AuthorID": "57195057007", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "35473055800": {"Name": "Kelly C.", "AuthorID": "35473055800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57156207200": {"Name": "Kimpton J.", "AuthorID": "57156207200", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "57191280661": {"Name": "Bonthrone A.", "AuthorID": "57191280661", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "54961012900": {"Name": "Batalle D.", "AuthorID": "54961012900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "7005059142": {"Name": "Counsell S.", "AuthorID": "7005059142", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for the Developing Brain, School of Biomedical Engineering & Imaging Sciences, King's College London"}, "36088339000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36088339000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
