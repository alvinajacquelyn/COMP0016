In these patients a rescue lesion through the DBS electrode has been suggested as an option. In this case report we present a patient where a pallidotomy was performed using the DBS electrode. Case Description: An elderly woman with bilateral Gpi DBS suffered an infection around the left burr hole involving the DBS electrode. A unilateral lesion was performed through the DBS electrode before it was removed. No side effects were encountered. Burke-Fahn-Marsden (BFM) dystonia movement scale score was 39 before DBS. With DBS before lesioning BFM score was 2.5 points. The replacement of the left sided stimulation with a pallidotomy resulted in only a minor deterioration of the score to 5 points. Conclusions: In the case presented here a small pallidotomy performed with the DBS electrode provided a satisfactory effect on the patient\u2032s dystonic symptoms. Thus, rescue lesions through the DBS electrodes, although off-label, might be considered in patients with Gpi DBS for dystonia when indicated.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "dystonia", "pallidotomy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009083990", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55928136000": {"Name": "Blomstedt P.", "AuthorID": "55928136000", "AffiliationID": "60031040", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology, Clinical Neuroscience, Ume\u00e5 University"}, "7201840568": {"Name": "Taira T.", "AuthorID": "7201840568", "AffiliationID": "60025639", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Tokyo Women' S Medical University"}, "7005641179": {"Name": "Hariz M.", "AuthorID": "7005641179", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
