All rights reserved.Services in smart environments pursue to increase the quality of people's lives. The most important issues when developing this kind of environments is testing and validating such services. These tasks usually imply high costs and annoying or unfeasible real-world testing. In such cases, artificial societies may be used to simulate the smart environment (i.e. physical environment, equipment and humans). With this aim, the CHROMUBE methodology guides test engineers when modeling human beings. Such models reproduce behaviors which are highly similar to the real ones. Originally, these models are based on automata whose transitions are governed by random variables. Automaton's structure and the probability distribution functions of each random variable are determined by a manual test and error process. In this paper, it is presented an alternative extension of this methodology which avoids the said manual process. It is based on learning human behavior patterns automatically from sensor data by using machine learning techniques. The presented approach has been tested on a real scenario, where this extension has given highly accurate human behavior models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Human behavior modeling", "Machine learning", "Smart environments testing", "Social simulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Artificial societies", "Human behavior modeling", "Human behavior models", "Human behavior patterns", "Machine learning techniques", "Physical environments", "Smart environment", "Social simulations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922598901", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"35271277300": {"Name": "Campuzano F.", "AuthorID": "35271277300", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Murcia, Facultad de Inform\u00e1tica, Campus Universitario de Espinardo"}, "30967497800": {"Name": "Garcia-Valverde T.", "AuthorID": "30967497800", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Murcia, Facultad de Inform\u00e1tica, Campus Universitario de Espinardo"}, "6603778116": {"Name": "Botia J.", "AuthorID": "6603778116", "AffiliationID": "60000130", "AffiliationName": "Universidad de Murcia, Facultad de Inform\u00e1tica, Campus Universitario de Espinardo"}, "26634305600": {"Name": "Serrano E.", "AuthorID": "26634305600", "AffiliationID": "60027282, 60028442", "AffiliationName": "Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Escuela T\u00e9cnica Superior de Ingenieros de Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Ciudad Universitaria"}}}
