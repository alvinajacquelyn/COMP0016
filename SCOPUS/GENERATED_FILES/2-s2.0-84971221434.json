Nature can be an excellent guide to rational design, as it is full of hierarchical structures that are intrinsically scaling, efficient and robust. However, much of the \"inspiration\" from nature is, at present, empirical; considering the huge design space, we advocate a methodical, fundamental approach based on mechanistic features.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84971221434", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"22954519900": {"Name": "Trogadas P.", "AuthorID": "22954519900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Frontier Engineering, Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering, University College London"}, "12803447700": {"Name": "Nigra M.M.", "AuthorID": "12803447700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Frontier Engineering, Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering, University College London"}, "54790515100": {"Name": "Coppens M.O.", "AuthorID": "54790515100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC Frontier Engineering, Centre for Nature Inspired Engineering, University College London"}}}
