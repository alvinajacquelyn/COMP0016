Evidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) is seen in 80% of patients with SSc. Currently there is no approved disease-modifying treatment for ILD and few effective treatment options are available. CYC is included in treatment guidelines, but it has limited efficacy and is associated with toxicity. MMF is becoming the most commonly used medication in clinical practice in North America and the UK, but its use is not universal. Newer agents targeting the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SSc-ILD, including fibrotic and inflammatory pathways, lymphocytes, cellcell and cellextracellular membrane interactions, hold promise for better treatment outcomes, including improved lung function, patient-related outcomes and quality of life. Here we review ongoing trials of established and novel agents that are currently recruiting patients with SSc-ILD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["abituzumab", "bortezomib", "dabigatran", "interstitial lung disease", "nintedanib", "pirfenidone", "pulmonary fibrosis", "study design", "systemic sclerosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Clinical Trials as Topic", "Humans", "Immunologic Factors", "Lung Diseases, Interstitial", "Scleroderma, Systemic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063713665", "SubjectAreas": [["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"24066781200": {"Name": "Khanna D.", "AuthorID": "24066781200", "AffiliationID": "60025778", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Scleroderma Program"}, "7102264513": {"Name": "Tashkin D.P.", "AuthorID": "7102264513", "AffiliationID": "60005247, 60027550", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California at Los Angeles"}, "7006031021": {"Name": "Denton C.P.", "AuthorID": "7006031021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Rheumatology, Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "57208076913": {"Name": "Lubell M.W.", "AuthorID": "57208076913", "AffiliationID": "60019942", "AffiliationName": "Global Clinical Development, EMD Serono Inc."}, "57063453800": {"Name": "Vazquez-Mateo C.", "AuthorID": "57063453800", "AffiliationID": "60019942", "AffiliationName": "Global Clinical Development, EMD Serono Inc."}, "50462556800": {"Name": "Wax S.", "AuthorID": "50462556800", "AffiliationID": "60019942", "AffiliationName": "Global Clinical Development, EMD Serono Inc."}}}
