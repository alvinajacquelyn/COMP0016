Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The development of age-Appropriate formulations should focus on dosage forms that can deliver variable yet accurate doses that are safe and acceptable to the child, are matched to his/her development and ability, and avoid medication errors. However, in the past decade, the medication needs of neonates have largely been neglected. The aim of this review is to expand on what differentiates the needs of preterm and term neonates from those of the older paediatric subsets, in terms of environment of care, ability to measure and administer the dose (from the perspective of the patient and carer, the routes of administration, the device and the product), neonatal bio-Pharmaceutics and regulatory challenges. This review offers insight into those challenges posed by the formulation of medicinal products for neonatal patients in order to support the development of clinically relevant products.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Administration", "Biopharmaceutics", "Device", "Dosage form", "Excipient", "Formulation", "Formulation development", "Inhaled", "Intra nasal", "Medication error", "Neonates", "NICU", "Oral", "Parenteral", "Product development", "Topical"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Chemistry, Pharmaceutical", "Drug Administration Routes", "Drug Compounding", "Drug Stability", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Pharmaceutical Preparations", "Precision Medicine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067173943", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Inorganic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1604"]], "AuthorData": {"57209778666": {"Name": "O\u2019Brien F.", "AuthorID": "57209778666", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "57193132721": {"Name": "Krysiak K.", "AuthorID": "57193132721", "AffiliationID": "60000050", "AffiliationName": "School of Pharmacy, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland"}, "36672717300": {"Name": "Clapham D.", "AuthorID": "36672717300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6602643941": {"Name": "Batchelor H.", "AuthorID": "6602643941", "AffiliationID": "60019702, 60033481", "AffiliationName": "College of Medical and Dental Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, University of Birmingham"}, "57209286456": {"Name": "Field P.", "AuthorID": "57209286456", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "37030724400": {"Name": "Caivano G.", "AuthorID": "37030724400", "AffiliationID": "60073828", "AffiliationName": "Chiesi Farmaceutici S.P.A"}, "57196940175": {"Name": "Pertile M.", "AuthorID": "57196940175", "AffiliationID": "60073828", "AffiliationName": "Chiesi Farmaceutici S.P.A"}, "7102771387": {"Name": "Nunn A.", "AuthorID": "7102771387", "AffiliationID": "60020661, 60030461", "AffiliationName": "Department of Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool Women\u2019s Hospital"}}}
