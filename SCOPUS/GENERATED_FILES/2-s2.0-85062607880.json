All rights reserved.Objective: To identify cross-border international registries for rare endocrine conditions that are led from Europe and to understand the extent of engagement with these registries within a network of reference centres (RCs) for rare endocrine conditions. Methods: Database search of international registries and a survey of RCs in the European Reference Network for rare endocrine conditions (Endo-ERN) with an overall response rate of 82%. Results: Of the 42 conditions with orphacodes currently covered within Endo-ERN, international registries exist for 32 (76%). Of 27 registries identified in the Orphanet and RD-Con nect databases, Endo-ERN RCs were aware of 11 (41%). Of 21 registries identified by the RC, RD-Connect and Orphanet d id not have a record of 10 (48%). Of the 29 glucose RCs, the awareness and participation rate in an international registry was highest for rare diabetes at 75 and 56% respectively. Of the 37 sex development RCs, the corresponding rates were highest for disorders of sex development at 70 and 52%. Of the 33 adrenal RCs, the rates were highest for adrenocortical tumours at 68 and 43%. Of the 43 pituitary RCs, the rates were highest for pituitary adenomas at 43 and 29%. Of the 31 genetic tumour RCs, the rates were highest for MEN1 at 26 and 9%. For the remaining conditions, awareness and participation in registries was less than 25%. Conclusion: Although there is a need to develop new registries for rare endocrine conditions, there is a more immediate need to improve the awareness and participation in existing registries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Endocrine System Diseases", "Europe", "Humans", "Rare Diseases", "Registries"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062607880", "SubjectAreas": [["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57210947852": {"Name": "Ali S.R.", "AuthorID": "57210947852", "AffiliationID": "60190225, 60117212", "AffiliationName": "Office for Rare Conditions, Royal Hospital for Children, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "14424069200": {"Name": "Ahmed S.F.", "AuthorID": "14424069200", "AffiliationID": "60190225, 60117212", "AffiliationName": "Office for Rare Conditions, Royal Hospital for Children, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "56080392900": {"Name": "Bryce J.", "AuthorID": "56080392900", "AffiliationID": "60190225, 60117212", "AffiliationName": "Office for Rare Conditions, Royal Hospital for Children, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "57220040292": {"Name": "Smyth A.", "AuthorID": "57220040292", "AffiliationID": "60190225, 60117212", "AffiliationName": "Office for Rare Conditions, Royal Hospital for Children, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital"}, "9943745400": {"Name": "Cools M.", "AuthorID": "9943745400", "AffiliationID": "60068590", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Endocrinology, Ghent University Hospital"}, "7004190977": {"Name": "Korbonits M.", "AuthorID": "7004190977", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Department of Endocrinology, William Harvey Research Institute Barts, London School of Medicine, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57207583610": {"Name": "Beun J.G.", "AuthorID": "57207583610", "AffiliationID": "122238848", "AffiliationName": "Dutch Adrenal Network (AdrenalNET)"}, "7003387113": {"Name": "Taruscio D.", "AuthorID": "7003387113", "AffiliationID": "60010062", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Rare Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanit"}, "7003794125": {"Name": "Danne T.", "AuthorID": "7003794125", "AffiliationID": "113036008", "AffiliationName": "Diabetes Center AUF der BULT"}, "7003534902": {"Name": "Dattani M.", "AuthorID": "7003534902", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine Programme, UCL, GOS, Institute of Child Health"}, "12792905600": {"Name": "Dekkers O.M.", "AuthorID": "12792905600", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Departments of Medicine and Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "6506354668": {"Name": "Linglart A.", "AuthorID": "6506354668", "AffiliationID": "60021567", "AffiliationName": "APHP Bic tre Paris Sud"}, "57208764300": {"Name": "Netchine I.", "AuthorID": "57208764300", "AffiliationID": "60001422", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit, Centre de Recherche Sainte Antoine, H pital des Enfants Armand Trousseau"}, "6603029236": {"Name": "Nordenstrom A.", "AuthorID": "6603029236", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Endocrinology and Inborn Errors of Metabolism, Karolinska University Hospital"}, "6602069527": {"Name": "Patocs A.", "AuthorID": "6602069527", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Genetics and Endocrinology Laboratory, Semmelweis University"}, "7006710878": {"Name": "Persani L.", "AuthorID": "7006710878", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan"}, "15052590100": {"Name": "Reisch N.", "AuthorID": "15052590100", "AffiliationID": "60000291", "AffiliationName": "Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik IV, Klinikum der Universit t M nchen"}, "6603897982": {"Name": "Sumnik Z.", "AuthorID": "6603897982", "AffiliationID": "60023469", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Motol University Hospital"}, "24350082100": {"Name": "Visser W.E.", "AuthorID": "24350082100", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus Medical Centre, Department of Internal Medicine, Academic Centre for Thyroid Diseases"}, "7005258062": {"Name": "Hiort O.", "AuthorID": "7005258062", "AffiliationID": "125125082", "AffiliationName": "Division of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of L beck"}, "7402230059": {"Name": "Pereira A.M.", "AuthorID": "7402230059", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Leiden University Medical Center"}}}
