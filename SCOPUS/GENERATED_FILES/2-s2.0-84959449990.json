As considered here, \u2018Choice and Challenge\u2019 emerges specifically from practice at the Wroxham School, led by Alison Peacock, which is the subject of the books Creating Learning Without Limits and Assessment for Learning Without Limits. The approach involves teachers providing children with a range of option set at different levels of \u2018challenge\u2019 and allowing them to work through the activities themselves, in dialogue with teachers and peers. It aims to motivate children in more enabling ways than grades and ranking, facilitating children\u2019s own reflection on and awareness of themselves as learners in a collaborative and non-competitive environment. It can be seen as inducing change by giving educators a \u2018hook\u2019 that delivers positive classroom experiences and thereby encourages openness to the broader philosophy and values on which it rests. The small-scale research project reported on here investigated the implementation of the approach in six primary schools around England. It aims to illuminate some of the issues encountered in doing so, thus stimulating reflection by those wishing to adopt similar approaches to improve schools and enhance social justice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ability grouping", "action research", "assessment", "challenge curriculum", "primary"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959449990", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"17433671300": {"Name": "Bragg S.", "AuthorID": "17433671300", "AffiliationID": "60007919", "AffiliationName": "University of Brighton"}}}
