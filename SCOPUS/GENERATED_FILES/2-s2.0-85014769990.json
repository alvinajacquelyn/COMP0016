Patients and methods In Part 1, patients received ME-344 10 mg/kg intravenously weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 in combination with topotecan 4 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Cycles were repeated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were evaluated for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in cycle 1 and ME-344 pharmacokinetic samples were obtained. In Part 2, patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCLC and ovarian cancer were enrolled in expansion cohorts treated at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) determined in Part 1. Results Fourteen patients were enrolled in Part 1 and no DLTs were observed. The RP2D of ME-344 in combination with topotecan was established as 10 mg/kg. In Part 2, 32 patients were enrolled. The most common treatment-emergent all-grade and grade 3/4 toxicities included fatigue (65.2%, 6.5%), neutropenia (56.5%, 43.5%) and thrombocytopenia (50%, 23.9%). One patient with recurrent ovarian cancer experienced a partial response by RECIST 1.1 and 21 patients achieved stable disease as best response. Conclusions The combination of ME-344 10 mg/kg weekly and topotecan 4 mg/m2 was tolerable, however, the degree of anti-cancer activity does not support further investigation of the combination in unselected patients with SCLC, ovarian and cervical cancers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ME-344", "Mitochondrial inhibitor", "Ovarian cancer", "Small cell lung cancer", "Topotecan"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Female", "Humans", "Isoflavones", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mitochondria", "Neoplasm Recurrence, Local", "Ovarian Neoplasms", "Topoisomerase I Inhibitors", "Topotecan", "Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014769990", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"26634927500": {"Name": "Diamond J.", "AuthorID": "26634927500", "AffiliationID": "60002393", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado Cancer Center"}, "55246528100": {"Name": "Ross Camidge D.", "AuthorID": "55246528100", "AffiliationID": "60002393", "AffiliationName": "University of Colorado Cancer Center"}, "7005945603": {"Name": "Goff B.", "AuthorID": "7005945603", "AffiliationID": "60031859", "AffiliationName": "University of Washington/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance"}, "57189580188": {"Name": "Forster M.", "AuthorID": "57189580188", "AffiliationID": "112801215", "AffiliationName": "Sarah Cannon Research Institute UK"}, "55995000100": {"Name": "Bendell J.", "AuthorID": "55995000100", "AffiliationID": "116518030", "AffiliationName": "Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology"}, "36992109000": {"Name": "Hamilton E.", "AuthorID": "36992109000", "AffiliationID": "116518030", "AffiliationName": "Sara Cannon Research Institute/Tennessee Oncology"}, "7004139129": {"Name": "Britten C.", "AuthorID": "7004139129", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of South Carolina"}, "7402801321": {"Name": "Gordon M.", "AuthorID": "7402801321", "AffiliationID": "110116777", "AffiliationName": "Pinnacle Oncology Hematology"}, "6603699691": {"Name": "Gabra H.", "AuthorID": "6603699691", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College London"}, "7003926868": {"Name": "Waterhouse D.", "AuthorID": "7003926868", "AffiliationID": "100396931", "AffiliationName": "Oncology Hematology Care"}, "57193548969": {"Name": "Poole M.", "AuthorID": "57193548969", "AffiliationID": "112569886", "AffiliationName": "MEI Pharma"}, "8560429300": {"Name": "Moore K.", "AuthorID": "8560429300", "AffiliationID": "60029833", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center"}}}
