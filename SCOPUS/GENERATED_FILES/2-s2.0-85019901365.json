The method provides an opportunity to precisely localise the bacterial infection sites within the animal and enables the generation of four-dimensional movies of the infection cycle. Here, we describe the use of the PerkinElmer IVIS SpectrumCT in vivo imaging system to investigate progression of lethal systemic infection in neonatal rats following colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract with the neonatal pathogen Escherichia coli K1. We confirm previous observations that these bacteria stably colonize the colon and small intestine following feeding of the infectious dose from a micropipette; invading bacteria migrate across the gut epithelium into the blood circulation and establish foci of infection in major organs, including the brain. DLIT-\u03bcCT revealed novel multiple sites of colonisation within the alimentary canal, including the tongue, oesophagus and stomach, with penetration of the non-keratinised oesophageal epithelial surface, providing strong evidence of a further major site for bacterial dissemination. We highlight technical issues associated with imaging of infections in new born rat pups and show that the whole-body and organ bioburden correlates with disease severity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-dependent susceptibility to infection", "Bioluminescence imaging", "Escherichia coli K1", "Gastrointestinal colonisation", "Neonatal meningitis", "Neonatal systemic infection"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Disease Models, Animal", "Disease Progression", "Escherichia coli Infections", "Genes, Reporter", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Luminescent Measurements", "Microorganisms, Genetically-Modified", "Rats", "Sepsis", "Tomography, Optical", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019901365", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"37041755900": {"Name": "Witcomb L.", "AuthorID": "37041755900", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "7404775765": {"Name": "Taylor P.", "AuthorID": "7404775765", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "University College London School of Pharmacy"}, "12793070300": {"Name": "Czupryna J.", "AuthorID": "12793070300", "AffiliationID": "60018611", "AffiliationName": "PerkinElmer"}, "7103208601": {"Name": "Francis K.", "AuthorID": "7103208601", "AffiliationID": "60018611", "AffiliationName": "PerkinElmer"}, "7102089790": {"Name": "Frankel G.", "AuthorID": "7102089790", "AffiliationID": "60015150, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Molecular Bacteriology and Infection, Imperial College London"}}}
