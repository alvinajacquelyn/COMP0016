This article summarizes the key ways in which personal(ized) books can enrich the language arts curriculum, drawing on a series of empirically based examples. The value of personalization in the digital stories is explained theoretically using the framework of five As: autonomy, authorship, authenticity, attachment, and aesthetics. The five As apply to personal(ized) stories created for, or by, young students and are used to generate some practical suggestions for future use of touchscreens in the classroom.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1-Early childhood", "2-Childhood", "7-Special needs", "Authentic < Assessment", "Digital/media literacies", "Instructional strategies", "methods and materials", "New literacies < Digital/media literacies", "Theoretical perspectives", "Visual literacy < Digital/media literacies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032587523", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"54408784700": {"Name": "Kucirkova N.", "AuthorID": "54408784700", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Education, University College London"}}}
