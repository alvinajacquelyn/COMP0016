Some studies suggest that the FTO gene is associated with alcohol consumption. We investigated whether a tagging variant (rs17817449)within the FTO gene is associated with alcohol intake, problem drinking and smoking behaviour. Methods: We analysed data from 26,792 Caucasian adults (47.2% of males; mean age 58.9 (\u00b17.3)years), examined through the prospective cohort HAPIEE study. The primary outcomes were daily alcohol consumption, binge drinking, problem drinking (CAGE score 2+)and smoking status in relation to tagging variants within the FTO and ADH1B genes. Results: We found no significant association of the FTO polymorphism with smoking status in either sex. The associations of the FTO polymorphism with drinking pattern were inconsistent and differed by gender. In men, GG homozygote carriers had lower odds of problem drinking (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75\u20130.96, p = 0.03). In women, the combination of the FTO/ADH1B GG/+A genotypes doubled the risk of binge drinking (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.19\u20133.71, p < 0.05), and the risk was further increased among smoking women (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.64\u201310.24, p = 0.008). Conclusions: In this large population study, the FTO gene appeared associated with binge and problem drinking, and the associations were modified by sex, smoking status and the ADH1B polymorphism.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ADH1B", "Alcohol intake", "Binge drinking", "FTO", "Polymorphism", "Sex", "Smoking"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Alcohol Dehydrogenase", "Alcohol Drinking", "Alcoholism", "Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO", "Binge Drinking", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Gene-Environment Interaction", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genotype", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Prospective Studies", "Sex Factors", "Smoking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065398795", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7102613233": {"Name": "Hubacek J.A.", "AuthorID": "7102613233", "AffiliationID": "60020529", "AffiliationName": "Center for Experimental Medicine, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine"}, "6602081223": {"Name": "Pikhart H.", "AuthorID": "6602081223", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Health and Society, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "8681509900": {"Name": "Peasey A.", "AuthorID": "8681509900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Health and Society, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7005266289": {"Name": "Bobak M.", "AuthorID": "7005266289", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "International Institute for Health and Society, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603876724": {"Name": "Malyutina S.", "AuthorID": "6603876724", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Branch of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics, SB RAS"}, "57195959148": {"Name": "Voevoda M.", "AuthorID": "57195959148", "AffiliationID": "60068684, 60017604", "AffiliationName": "Research Institute of Internal and Preventive Medicine, Branch of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics, SB RAS"}, "7004784461": {"Name": "Pajak A.", "AuthorID": "7004784461", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Population Studies, Institute of Public Health, Faculty of Health Care, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "57211811198": {"Name": "Tamosiunas A.", "AuthorID": "57211811198", "AffiliationID": "60109642, 60064285", "AffiliationName": "Department of Population Studies, Institute of Cardiology of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences"}, "35740512000": {"Name": "Holmes M.V.", "AuthorID": "35740512000", "AffiliationID": "60170323, 60172675, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford University Hospital"}}}
