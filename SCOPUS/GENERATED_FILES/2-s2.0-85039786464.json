The repair phase is a key step for the effectiveness of the subsequent regenerative process: in vertebrates, efficient re-epithelialisation, rapid inflammatory/immune response and post-injury tissue remodelling are fundamental aspects for the success of this phase, their impairment leading to an inhibition or total prevention of regeneration. Among deuterostomes, echinoderms display a unique combination of striking regenerative abilities and diversity of useful experimental models, although still largely unexplored. Therefore, the brittle star Amphiura filiformis and the starfish Echinaster sepositus were here used to comparatively investigate the main repair phase events after injury as well as the presence and expression of immune system and extracellular matrix (i.e. collagen) molecules using both microscopy and molecular tools. Our results showed that emergency reaction and re-epithelialisation are similar in both echinoderm models, being faster and more effective than in mammals. Moreover, in comparison to the latter, both echinoderms showed delayed and less abundant collagen deposition at the wound site (absence of fibrosis). The gene expression patterns of molecules related to the immune response, such as Ese-fib-like (starfishes) and Afi-ficolin (brittle stars), were described for the first time during echinoderm regeneration providing promising starting points to investigate the immune system role in these regeneration models. Overall, the similarities in repair events and timing within the echinoderms and the differences with what has been reported in mammals suggest that effective repair processes in echinoderms play an important role for their subsequent ability to regenerate. Targeted molecular and functional analyses will shed light on the evolution of these abilities in the deuterostomian lineage.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brittle stars", "Collagen", "Emergency reaction", "Immune/inflammatory response", "Starfishes", "Wound healing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Collagen", "Epidermis", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Extremities", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Genetic Association Studies", "Microscopy, Electron", "Regeneration", "Species Specificity", "Starfish", "Transcription Factors", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039786464", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56740283200": {"Name": "Ferrario C.", "AuthorID": "56740283200", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze e Politiche Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "24398279500": {"Name": "Colombo G.", "AuthorID": "24398279500", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Bioscienze, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "6602833029": {"Name": "Bonasoro F.", "AuthorID": "6602833029", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze e Politiche Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "56785865900": {"Name": "Candia Carnevali M.D.", "AuthorID": "56785865900", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze e Politiche Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "12802254400": {"Name": "Sugni M.", "AuthorID": "12802254400", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze e Politiche Ambientali, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Milano"}, "55944944500": {"Name": "Ben Khadra Y.", "AuthorID": "55944944500", "AffiliationID": "60070635, 60050038", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Recherche, G\u00e9n\u00e9tique, Biodiversit\u00e9 et Valorisation des Bioressources, Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de Biotechnologie de Monastir, Universit\u00e9 de Monastir"}, "55903227600": {"Name": "Czarkwiani A.", "AuthorID": "55903227600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "56004459200": {"Name": "Zakrzewski A.", "AuthorID": "56004459200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6602473832": {"Name": "Oliveri P.", "AuthorID": "6602473832", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "24431870500": {"Name": "Martinez P.", "AuthorID": "24431870500", "AffiliationID": "60032907", "AffiliationName": "ICREA (Institut Catal\u00e0 de Recerca i Estudis Avancats)"}}}
