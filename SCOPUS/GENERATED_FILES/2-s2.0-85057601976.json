We interviewed 27 women who had recently experienced at least one potential breast cancer symptom, and explored their symptom experience, help-seeking strategies, and whether they consulted the internet in relation to their symptoms. We conducted a thematic analysis and constructed a typology of attitudes towards, and experiences of, consulting the internet about the symptoms: i) confident; ii) neutral; iii) hesitant; and iv) avoidant. \u2018Hesitant\u2019 and \u2018avoidant\u2019 participants rarely mentioned cancer explicitly, doubted being able to interpret the information found online, and expressed concerns over finding \u2018scaremongering\u2019 information or making incorrect self-diagnosis. The \u2018avoiders\u2019 and the \u2018hesitant\u2019 participants perceived online information-seeking as being inherently risky, partly because online health content is likely to be inaccurate or exaggerated, and partly because the process of lay interpretation is likely to be flawed by lack of medical expertise. The findings suggest that not all women experiencing potential breast cancer symptoms seek health information online spontaneously or trust the internet as a legitimate source of health information. The women who did engage in online information seeking, particularly those with lower education, felt unsure about how to appraise online health sources to interpret their symptoms.", "AuthorKeywords": ["breast cancer", "early diagnosis", "internet", "online information-seeking", "trust"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057601976", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"37102403900": {"Name": "Marcu A.", "AuthorID": "37102403900", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "24167321100": {"Name": "Whitaker K.L.", "AuthorID": "24167321100", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Sciences, University of Surrey"}, "55443735800": {"Name": "Black G.", "AuthorID": "55443735800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}}}
