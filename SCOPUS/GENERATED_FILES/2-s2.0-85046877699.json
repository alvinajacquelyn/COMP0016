Background: Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, x-linked lysosomal storage disorder. Mortality is mainly cardiovascular with men exhibiting cardiac symptoms earlier than women. By cardiovascular magnetic resonance, native T1 is low in FD because of sphingolipid accumulation. Methods: A prospective, observational study of 182 FD (167 adults, 15 children; mean age 42 \u00b1 17 years, 37% male) who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance including native T1, late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), and extracellular volume fraction, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and blood biomarkers (troponin and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide). Results: In children, T1 was never below the normal range, but was lower with age (9 ms/year, r = \u22120.78 children; r = \u22120.41 whole cohort; both p < 0.001). Over the whole cohort, the T1 reduction with age was greater and more marked in men (men: \u22121.9 ms/year, r = \u22120.51, p < 0.001; women: \u22121.4 ms/year, r = \u22120.47 women, p < 0.001). Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), LGE, and electrocardiogram abnormalities occur earlier in men. Once LVH occurs, T1 demonstrates major sex dimorphism: with increasing LVH in women, T1 and LVH become uncorrelated (r = \u22120.239, p = 0.196) but in men, the correlation reverses and T1 increases (toward normal) with LVH (r = 0.631, p < 0.001), a U-shaped relationship of T1 to indexed left ventricular mass in men. Conclusions: These data suggest that myocyte storage starts in childhood and accumulates faster in men before triggering 2 processes: a sex-independent scar/inflammation regional response (LGE) and, in men, apparent myocyte hypertrophy diluting the T1 lowering of sphingolipid.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fabry disease", "gender", "native T1", "phenotype"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Arrhythmias, Cardiac", "Cardiomyopathies", "Child", "Contrast Media", "Disease Progression", "Fabry Disease", "Female", "Humans", "Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Meglumine", "Middle Aged", "Myocardium", "Organometallic Compounds", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Prospective Studies", "Sex Characteristics", "Sex Factors", "Sphingolipids", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Ventricular Remodeling", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046877699", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57190741709": {"Name": "Nordin S.", "AuthorID": "57190741709", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57199864257": {"Name": "Medina-Menacho K.", "AuthorID": "57199864257", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "56528300800": {"Name": "Abdel-Gadir A.", "AuthorID": "56528300800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "57202030544": {"Name": "Lobascio I.", "AuthorID": "57202030544", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, Barts Heart Centre"}, "7403231345": {"Name": "Moon J.C.", "AuthorID": "7403231345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "37561681400": {"Name": "Kozor R.", "AuthorID": "37561681400", "AffiliationID": "60121699, 60025709", "AffiliationName": "Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney"}, "57191835191": {"Name": "Baig S.", "AuthorID": "57191835191", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospitals Birmingham"}, "14065849200": {"Name": "Edwards N.C.", "AuthorID": "14065849200", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospitals Birmingham"}, "57189931631": {"Name": "Steeds R.P.", "AuthorID": "57189931631", "AffiliationID": "60026493", "AffiliationName": "Cardiology Department, University Hospitals Birmingham"}, "57203175810": {"Name": "Sado D.M.", "AuthorID": "57203175810", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London"}, "56497461300": {"Name": "Murphy E.", "AuthorID": "56497461300", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "7003596979": {"Name": "Lachmann R.H.", "AuthorID": "7003596979", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Charles Dent Metabolic Unit, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "56921222900": {"Name": "Mehta A.", "AuthorID": "56921222900", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Lysosomal Storage Disorder Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}, "57214714076": {"Name": "Ramaswami U.", "AuthorID": "57214714076", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Lysosomal Storage Disorder Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}, "55186237200": {"Name": "Hughes D.", "AuthorID": "55186237200", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Lysosomal Storage Disorder Unit, Royal Free Hospital"}}}
