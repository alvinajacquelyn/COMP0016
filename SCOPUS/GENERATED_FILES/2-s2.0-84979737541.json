The former type is usually static in spatial configuration and configured to support a small group of users. The latter supports only a single user. We propose a new class of actuated, reconfigurable display that can support both small groups and individual users: in particular we suggest a robotic display that can change shape. The display can change shape to support different usage conditions, and can also move rapidly to give a larger apparent field of view for an individual user. We explore the potential advantages of a display that can move independently from its user(s), and we present a prototype that demonstrates some of the potential use scenarios.", "AuthorKeywords": ["H.5.1 [Multimedia Information Systems]: Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities", "I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism - Virtual reality"], "IndexKeywords": ["H.5.1 [multimedia information systems]: artificial , augmented , and virtual realities", "Head mounted displays", "I.3.7 [computer graphics]: three-dimensional graphics and realism - virtual realities", "Immersive display", "Reconfigurable", "Shape-changing displays", "Spatial configuration", "Virtual reality system"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979737541", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"]], "AuthorData": {"18435050200": {"Name": "Steed A.", "AuthorID": "18435050200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
