Most of the current multimodal analyses in AD assume a local (spatially overlapping) relationship between MR and FDG-PET intensities. However, it is well known that atrophy and hypometabolism are prominent in different anatomical areas. The aim of this work is to describe the relationship between atrophy and hypometabolism by means of a data-driven statistical model of non-overlapping intensity correlations. For this purpose, FDG-PET and MRI signals are jointly analyzed through a computationally tractable formulation of partial least squares regression (PLSR). The PLSR model is estimated and validated on a large clinical cohort of 1049 individuals from the ADNI dataset. Results show that the proposed non-local analysis outperforms classical local approaches in terms of predictive accuracy while providing a plausible description of disease dynamics: early AD is characterised by non-overlapping temporal atrophy and temporo-parietal hypometabolism, while the later disease stages show overlapping brain atrophy and hypometabolism spread in temporal, parietal and cortical areas.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Brain", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Male", "Models, Statistical", "Multimodal Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964845330", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"26654433200": {"Name": "Lorenzi M.", "AuthorID": "26654433200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, UCL"}, "52364860800": {"Name": "Simpson I.", "AuthorID": "52364860800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, UCL"}, "55767608300": {"Name": "Mendelson A.", "AuthorID": "55767608300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, UCL"}, "36931857600": {"Name": "Vos S.", "AuthorID": "36931857600", "AffiliationID": "60030943", "AffiliationName": "MRI Unit, Epilepsy Society"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, UCL"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, UCL"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, CMIC, UCL"}, "7103177641": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177641", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, Institute of Neurology, UCL"}}}
