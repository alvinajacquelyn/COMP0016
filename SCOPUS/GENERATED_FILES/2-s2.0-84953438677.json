We report the prevalence and risk factors for elevated blood Co and Cr levels in patients with a unilateral MoM hip. Methods: From a single institution, blood Co and Cr levels were analyzed in 1748 patients (692 hip resurfacings and 1056 total hip arthroplasties [THAs]). Concentrations exceeding 7 ppb were considered elevated, and the risk factors for elevated levels were calculated with binary logistic regression. Results: Elevated blood metal ion levels were more common in MoM THA than in resurfacing patients (17.4% vs 5.9%, P < .001), and in 5 of the 7 THA brands, more than 20% of patients had elevated metal ion concentrations, whereas the proportion was less than 10% in all hip resurfacings. In resurfacings, small femoral head (odds ratio [OR] 1.30 per millimeter decrease [CI, 1.12-1.49]), high acetabular inclination (OR 1.15 per degree increase [CI 1.09-1.22]), and young age (OR 1.05 per year decrease [1.02-1.10]) were independent risk factors for elevated ions. In the THA group, female gender (OR 2.04 [CI 1.35-3.06]), longer time between surgery and ion measurement (OR 1.19 per year increase [CI 1.05-1.34]), and large headsize (OR 1.07 per millimeter increase [CI 1.01-1.13]) were risk factors for elevated ions. Conclusion: Given the high percentage of elevated levels, the systematic surveillance of especially large diameter MoM THAs seems justified.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood", "Chromium", "Cobalt", "Metal-on-metal", "Resurfacing", "Total hip arthroplasty"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip", "Chromium", "Cobalt", "Female", "Hip Prosthesis", "Humans", "Ions", "Male", "Metal-on-Metal Joint Prostheses", "Metals", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Range of Motion, Articular", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953438677", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"]], "AuthorData": {"56453505500": {"Name": "Lainiala O.S.", "AuthorID": "56453505500", "AffiliationID": "60098936", "AffiliationName": "Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement"}, "57200217927": {"Name": "Moilanen T.P.S.", "AuthorID": "57200217927", "AffiliationID": "60098936", "AffiliationName": "Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement"}, "8283685400": {"Name": "Eskelinen A.P.", "AuthorID": "8283685400", "AffiliationID": "60098936", "AffiliationName": "Coxa Hospital for Joint Replacement"}, "24597673100": {"Name": "Hart A.J.", "AuthorID": "24597673100", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "26640768800": {"Name": "Sabah S.A.", "AuthorID": "26640768800", "AffiliationID": "60024067, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London and the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital"}, "55809689700": {"Name": "Huhtala H.S.A.", "AuthorID": "55809689700", "AffiliationID": "60011170", "AffiliationName": "University of Tampere, School of Health Sciences"}}}
