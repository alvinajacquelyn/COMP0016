Objectives: To determine the diagnostic accuracy and interobserver concordance of whole-body (WB)-MRI, vs. 99m Tc bone scintigraphy (BS) and 18 fluoro-ethyl-choline ( 18 F-choline) PET/CT for the primary staging of intermediate/high-risk prostate cancer. Methods: An institutional review board approved prospective cohort study carried out between July 2012 and November 2015, whereby 56 men prospectively underwent 3.0-T multiparametric (mp)-WB-MRI in addition to BS (all patients) \u00b1 18 F-choline PET/CT (33 patients). MRI comprised pre- and post-contrast modified Dixon (mDixon), T2-weighted (T2W) imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Patients underwent follow-up mp-WB-MRI at 1 year to derive the reference standard. WB-MRIs were reviewed by two radiologists applying a 6-point scale and a locked sequential read (LSR) paradigm for the suspicion of nodal (N) and metastatic disease (M1a and M1b). Results: The mean sensitivity/specificity of WB-MRI for N1 disease was 1.00/0.96 respectively, compared with 1.00/0.82 for 18 F-choline PET/CT. The mean sensitivity and specificity of WB-MRI, 18 F-choline PET/CT, and BS were 0.90/0.88, 0.80/0.92, and 0.60/1.00 for M1b disease. ROC-AUC did not show statistically significant improvement for each component of the LSR; mean ROC-AUC 0.92, 0.94, and 0.93 (p < 0.05) for mDixon + DWI, + T2WI, and + contrast respectively. WB-MRI had an interobserver concordance (\u03ba) of 0.79, 0.68, and 0.58 for N1, M1a, and M1b diseases respectively. Conclusions: WB-MRI provides high levels of diagnostic accuracy for both nodal and metastatic bone disease, with higher levels of sensitivity than BS for metastatic disease, and similar performance to 18 F-choline PET/CT. T2 and post-contrast mDixon had no significant additive value above a protocol comprising mDixon and DWI alone. Key Points: \u2022 A whole-body MRI protocol comprising unenhanced mDixon and diffusion-weighted imaging provides high levels of diagnostic accuracy for the primary staging of intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. \u2022 The diagnostic accuracy of whole-body MRI is much higher than that of bone scintigraphy, as currently recommended for clinical use. \u2022 Staging using WB-MRI, rather than bone scintigraphy, could result in better patient stratification and treatment delivery than is currently provided to patients worldwide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Choline", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Positron emission tomography", "Prostate"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Bone Neoplasms", "Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Humans", "Lymph Nodes", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm Staging", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Prospective Studies", "Prostatic Neoplasms", "Reproducibility of Results", "ROC Curve", "Whole Body Imaging"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057987674", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56053957500": {"Name": "Johnston E.W.", "AuthorID": "56053957500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "55961544100": {"Name": "Latifoltojar A.", "AuthorID": "55961544100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "57197258948": {"Name": "Sidhu H.S.", "AuthorID": "57197258948", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "8833101600": {"Name": "Ramachandran N.", "AuthorID": "8833101600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "17036141700": {"Name": "Punwani S.", "AuthorID": "17036141700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Centre for Medical Imaging"}, "55220094000": {"Name": "Sokolska M.", "AuthorID": "55220094000", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics, University College London Hospital"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics, University College London Hospital"}, "7402982572": {"Name": "Moore C.", "AuthorID": "7402982572", "AffiliationID": "60027403", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College Hospital"}, "8147855500": {"Name": "Ahmed H.U.", "AuthorID": "8147855500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, Imperial College London"}}}
