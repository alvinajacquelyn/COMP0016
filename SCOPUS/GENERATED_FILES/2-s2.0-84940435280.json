Due to variability in absolute levels between laboratories, there is no consensus on medical cut-off value for the CSF AD signature. Thus, for full implementation of this core AD biomarker panel in clinical routine, this issue has to be solved. Variability can be explained both by pre-analytical and analytical factors. For example, the plastic tubes used for CSF collection and storage, the lack of reference material and the variability of the analytical protocols were identified as important sources of variability. The aim of this review is to highlight these pre-analytical and analytical factors and describe efforts done to counteract them in order to establish cut-off values for core CSF AD biomarkers. This review will give the current state of recommendations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer diagnosis", "Analytical confounders", "Biomarkers", "CSF", "Dementia", "Pre-analytical confounders"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Biomarkers", "Clinical Laboratory Techniques", "Diagnostic Techniques, Neurological", "Humans", "Reproducibility of Results"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940435280", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"56521519700": {"Name": "Fourier A.", "AuthorID": "56521519700", "AffiliationID": "60023578, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "University of Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5292, INSERM U1028, BioRan"}, "8095895400": {"Name": "Quadrio I.", "AuthorID": "8095895400", "AffiliationID": "60023578, 60000905", "AffiliationName": "University of Lyon 1, CNRS UMR5292, INSERM U1028, BioRan"}, "6603560410": {"Name": "Perret-Liaudet A.", "AuthorID": "6603560410", "AffiliationID": "115621450", "AffiliationName": "Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Biologie Clinique (SFBC), Alzheimer Biomarkers group co-coordination"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Clinical, Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675", "AffiliationName": "Clinical, Neurochemistry Laboratory, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}}}
