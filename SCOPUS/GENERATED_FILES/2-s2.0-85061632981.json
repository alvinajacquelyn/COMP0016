In the current work, the mechanical behaviour of PEMFCs using metal foam flow-fields is investigated across different length scales using a combination of electrochemical testing, X-ray computed tomography (CT), compression tests, and finite element analysis (FEA) numerical modelling. Fuel cell peak power was seen to improve by 42% when foam compression was increased from 20% to 70% due to a reduction in the interfacial contact resistance between the foam and GDL. X-ray CT scans at varying compression levels reveal high levels of interaction between the metal foam and gas diffusion layer (GDL), with foam ligaments penetrating over 50% of the GDL thickness under 25% cell compression. The interfacial contact area between the foam and GDL were seen to be 10 times higher than between the foam and a stainless-steel plate. Modelling results demonstrate highly uniform contact pressure distribution across the cell due to plastic deformation of the foam. The effect of stack over-tightening and operating conditions are investigated, demonstrating only small changes in load distribution when paired with a suitable sealing gasket material.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compression", "Flow-field", "Metal foam", "PEMFC", "Porosity", "X-ray CT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Different length scale", "Electrochemical testing", "Interfacial contact resistance", "Polymer electrolyte fuel cells", "Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs)", "Uniform contact pressure distribution", "X-ray computed tomography", "X-ray CT"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061632981", "SubjectAreas": [["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Fuel Technology", "ENER", "2103"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Energy Engineering and Power Technology", "ENER", "2102"]], "AuthorData": {"55943443500": {"Name": "Fly A.", "AuthorID": "55943443500", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "7406316034": {"Name": "Chen R.", "AuthorID": "7406316034", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Loughborough University"}, "57202240331": {"Name": "Meyer Q.", "AuthorID": "57202240331", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "Nanoelectrochemistry Group, School of Chemistry, UNSW"}, "56152608100": {"Name": "Whiteley M.", "AuthorID": "56152608100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "56901064000": {"Name": "Iacoviello F.", "AuthorID": "56901064000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "54962772600": {"Name": "Neville T.", "AuthorID": "54962772600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "24178516700": {"Name": "Shearing P.R.", "AuthorID": "24178516700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "13805905800": {"Name": "Brett D.J.L.", "AuthorID": "13805905800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Electrochemical Innovation Lab, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "57204594487": {"Name": "Kim C.", "AuthorID": "57204594487", "AffiliationID": "60087822", "AffiliationName": "Korea Institute of Energy Research"}}}
