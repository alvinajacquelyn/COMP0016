When O2 is in its vibrational ground state, the main contribution for both processes comes from the 2\u03a0u resonance state of O2- but with a significant contribution from the 4\u03a3u- resonant state. Vibrational excitation leads to an increased contribution from the low-lying 2\u03a0g resonance, greatly increased cross sections for both processes, and the threshold moving to lower energies. These results provide important input for models of O2-containing plasmas in nonequilibrium conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Dissociative electron attachment", "Electron impact", "Electron impact dissociation", "Nonequilibrium conditions", "Resonance curves", "Vibrational excitation", "Vibrational ground state", "Vibrationally excited"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920648967", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"6504449278": {"Name": "Laporta V.", "AuthorID": "6504449278", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603689349": {"Name": "Celiberto R.", "AuthorID": "6603689349", "AffiliationID": "60027299", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria Civile, Ambientale, Del Territorio, Edile e di Chimica, Politecnico di Bari"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
