Oxygen-vacancy formation energies (EOvac) are influenced by substituting Ce4+ cations in CeO2 by U4+ cations. The pDOS analyses indicate charge transfer mechanism from the O2p and U5f orbitals to the Ce4f orbitals upon the creation of an oxygen vacancy resulting in the reduction of three Ce4+ cations (instead of two in the un-doped system) to three Ce3+ cations. A linear correlation between EOvac and U content has been found which may explain the initially observed experimental correlation between H2 production from water on this system. The increased hydrogen production from water using mixed charged elements (such as Ce and U in this work) may be rationally designed computationally.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ce1-xUxO2 solid solution", "CeO2 reduction", "Density of states", "DFT-GGA + U", "Hydrogen production from water"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge transfer mechanisms", "Density of state", "DFT-GGA", "Experimental correlation", "Linear correlation", "Oxygen vacancy formation energies", "Redox property", "Uranium cations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84928644873", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"18435278200": {"Name": "Scaranto J.", "AuthorID": "18435278200", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SABIC Corporate Research and Innovation Center (CRI), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "SABIC Corporate Research and Innovation Center (CRI), King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}}}
