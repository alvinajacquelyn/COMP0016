Here, we used a well-validated quantitative MR protocol to measure four parameters (R1, MT, R2* PD*) that differ in their sensitivity to facets of the tissue microstructural environment (R1, MT: myelin, macromolecular content; R2*: myelin, paramagnetic ions, i.e., iron; PD*: free water content). Mapping these parameters across cortical regions in a young adult cohort (18\u201339 years, N = 93) revealed expected patterns of increased macromolecular content as well as reduced tissue water content in primary and primary adjacent cortical regions. Mapping across cortical depth within regions showed decreased expression of myelin and related processes \u2013 but increased tissue water content \u2013 when progressing from the grey/white to the grey/pial boundary, in all regions. Charting developmental change in cortical microstructure cross-sectionally, we found that parameters with sensitivity to tissue myelin (R1 & MT) showed linear increases with age across frontal and parietal cortex (change 0.5\u20131.0% per year). Overlap of robust age effects for both parameters emerged in left inferior frontal, right parietal and bilateral pre-central regions. Our findings afford an improved understanding of ontogeny in early adulthood and offer normative quantitative MR data for inter- and intra-cortical composition, which may be used as benchmarks in further studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aging", "Microstructure", "Multi-parameter maps (MPM)", "Myelination", "Quantitative MRI"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Body Water", "Cerebral Cortex", "Female", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Myelin Sheath", "Neuroimaging", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044637624", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56414248300": {"Name": "Carey D.", "AuthorID": "56414248300", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development (CBCD), Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57000515100": {"Name": "Caprini F.", "AuthorID": "57000515100", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development (CBCD), Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "14522185400": {"Name": "Dick F.", "AuthorID": "14522185400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck/UCL Centre for Neuroimaging (BUCNI)"}, "55377122200": {"Name": "Allen M.", "AuthorID": "55377122200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "12345539900": {"Name": "Lutti A.", "AuthorID": "12345539900", "AffiliationID": "60023561", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Recherche en Neuroimagerie \u2013 LREN, Departement des Neurosciences Cliniques, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV)"}, "6602786222": {"Name": "Weiskopf N.", "AuthorID": "6602786222", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurophysics, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "7202374409": {"Name": "Rees G.", "AuthorID": "7202374409", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "9736087500": {"Name": "Callaghan M.F.", "AuthorID": "9736087500", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}}}
