Traditionally, metal complexes are used as homogeneous catalysts for these organic transformations. Here we report gold-palladium and ruthenium-palladium nano-alloys supported on TiO2 acting as highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts for the one-pot synthesis of the imine N-benzylideneaniline and the secondary amine N-benzylaniline directly from the easily available and stable nitrobenzene and benzyl alcohol precursors using a hydrogen auto-transfer strategy. These reactions were carried out without any added external hydrogen, sacrificial hydrogen donor or a homogeneous base. The bimetallic catalysts were prepared by the recently developed modified impregnation strategy, giving efficient control of size and nano-alloy composition. Both bimetallic catalysts were found to be far more active than their monometallic analogues due to a synergistic effect. Based on the turnover numbers the catalytic activities follow the order Ru < Pd < Au \u226a Au-Pd < Ru-Pd. Aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAFS) studies of these catalysts revealed that the reason for the observed synergistic effect is the electronic modification of the metal sites in the case of the Au-Pd system and a size stabilisation effect in the case of the Ru-Pd catalyst.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopies", "Bimetallic catalysts", "Electronic modifications", "Functionalizations", "Heterogeneous catalyst", "Homogeneous catalyst", "Organic transformations", "Synergistic effect"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978438248", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"]], "AuthorData": {"6701530392": {"Name": "Sankar M.", "AuthorID": "6701530392", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "8283902100": {"Name": "Bruijnincx P.C.A.", "AuthorID": "8283902100", "AffiliationID": "60070173, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University"}, "7005917472": {"Name": "Weckhuysen B.M.", "AuthorID": "7005917472", "AffiliationID": "60070173, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Inorganic Chemistry and Catalysis, Debye Institute for Nanomaterials Science, Utrecht University"}, "57190219928": {"Name": "Dawson S.", "AuthorID": "57190219928", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "57197552741": {"Name": "Nowicka E.", "AuthorID": "57197552741", "AffiliationID": "60023998", "AffiliationName": "Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry, Cardiff University"}, "57195329363": {"Name": "He Q.", "AuthorID": "57195329363", "AffiliationID": "60000060", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science and Engineering, Lehigh University"}, "55991524600": {"Name": "Lu L.", "AuthorID": "55991524600", "AffiliationID": "60000060", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science and Engineering, Lehigh University"}, "7007159373": {"Name": "Kiely C.J.", "AuthorID": "7007159373", "AffiliationID": "60000060", "AffiliationName": "Department of Material Science and Engineering, Lehigh University"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
