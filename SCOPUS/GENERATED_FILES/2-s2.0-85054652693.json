Here we combine gas-phase anion photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum chemistry calculations to investigate how locking the C=C bond in the chromophore controls the competition between these electronic relaxation processes following photoexcitation in the range 400-310 nm. We find evidence to suggest that preventing trans-cis isomerization effectively turns off internal conversion to the ground electronic state and enhances electron emission from the first electronically excited state.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Electronic relaxation", "First electronically excited state", "Ground electronic state", "Photoactive yellow protein chromophores", "Photoactive yellow proteins", "Photochemical pathways", "Quantum chemistry calculations", "Trans-cis isomerization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054652693", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57189599835": {"Name": "Henley A.", "AuthorID": "57189599835", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "57199234601": {"Name": "Patel A.", "AuthorID": "57199234601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8839107300": {"Name": "Parkes M.", "AuthorID": "8839107300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55553734284": {"Name": "Anderson J.", "AuthorID": "55553734284", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7003283537": {"Name": "Fielding H.", "AuthorID": "7003283537", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
