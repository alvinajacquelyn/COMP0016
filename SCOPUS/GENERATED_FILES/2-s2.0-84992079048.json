All rights reserved.This paper evaluated the use of Three-dimensional (3D) Computer Visual Materials (CVM) to support user participation in the early design stages for a private house. A qualitative approach was identified in two stages. Firstly, a semi-structured interview with a sample of architectural firms was conducted, and secondly, data was collected from conversational dialogues between an architect and a list of clients. The results revealed that various stages of the design process have different responses with respect to the use of Visual Material (VM) and its impact on user participation. In addition, there appeared to be a direct relationship between the Level of Details (LoDs) and specific design stages.", "AuthorKeywords": ["architectural design", "computer visual material", "Design process", "user participation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Architectural firms", "Design process", "Early design stages", "Level of detail", "Qualitative approach", "Semi structured interviews", "Threedimensional (3-d)", "User participation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992079048", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Artificial Intelligence", "COMP", "1702"]], "AuthorData": {"57192121235": {"Name": "Saleh A.", "AuthorID": "57192121235", "AffiliationID": "60072733", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, An Najah National University"}, "36727578900": {"Name": "Hijazi I.", "AuthorID": "36727578900", "AffiliationID": "60072733", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Engineering, An Najah National University"}, "6701481248": {"Name": "Rafi A.", "AuthorID": "6701481248", "AffiliationID": "60012005", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Creative Multimedia, Multimedia University"}, "16065290700": {"Name": "Woods P.", "AuthorID": "16065290700", "AffiliationID": "60012005", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Creative Multimedia, Multimedia University"}, "57192490717": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57192490717", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Urban Design, Wuhan University"}, "55477979800": {"Name": "Cheng S.", "AuthorID": "55477979800", "AffiliationID": "60029306", "AffiliationName": "School of Urban Design, Wuhan University"}}}
