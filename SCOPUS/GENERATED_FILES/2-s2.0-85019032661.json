Methods: We used a case-control study design in which patients who had a first recorded diagnosis of CFS/ME during the period 01/01/2001 to 31/12/2013 were matched 1:1 with controls by age, sex, and GP practice. We compared rates of GP consultations, diagnostic tests, prescriptions, referrals, and symptoms between the two groups from 15 years (in adults) or 10 years (in children) before diagnosis to 10 years after diagnosis. Results: Data were available for 6710 adult and 916 child (age <18 years) matched case-control pairs. Rates of GP consultations, diagnostic tests, prescriptions, referrals, and symptoms spiked dramatically in the year when a CFS/ME diagnosis was recorded. GP consultation rates were 50% higher in adult cases compared to controls 11-15 years before diagnosis (rate ratio (RR) 1.49 (95% CI 1.46, 1.52)) and 56% higher 6-10 years after diagnosis (RR 1.56 (1.54, 1.57)). In children, consultation rates in cases were 45% higher 6-10 years before diagnosis (RR 1.45 (1.40, 1.51)) and 62% higher 6-10 years after diagnosis (RR 1.62 (1.54, 1.70)). For adults and children, rates of tests, prescriptions, referrals, and symptoms were higher in cases compared to controls for up to 10 years before and after diagnosis. Conclusions: Adults and children with CFS/ME have greater health care needs than the rest of the population for at least ten years before their diagnosis, and these higher levels of health care resource use continue for at least ten years after diagnosis.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adults", "CFS/ME", "Children", "Chronic fatigue syndrome", "CPRD", "Diagnosis", "fibromyalgia", "Health care resource use", "Primary care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Case-Control Studies", "Delivery of Health Care", "Fatigue Syndrome, Chronic", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Socioeconomic Factors", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019032661", "SubjectAreas": [["Family Practice", "MEDI", "2714"]], "AuthorData": {"7102643108": {"Name": "Collin S.M.", "AuthorID": "7102643108", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Oakfield House"}, "23033550500": {"Name": "Crawley E.", "AuthorID": "23033550500", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Oakfield House"}, "7003457149": {"Name": "Bakken I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003457149", "AffiliationID": "60011916", "AffiliationName": "Norwegian Institute of Public Health Nydalen"}, "55334594200": {"Name": "Nazareth I.", "AuthorID": "55334594200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care and Population Science, UCL Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL Royal Free Campus"}, "55924316400": {"Name": "White P.D.", "AuthorID": "55924316400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Psychological Medicine, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts, London, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
