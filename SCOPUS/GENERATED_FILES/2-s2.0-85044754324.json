Identifying high-risk children who may benefit from further therapeutic intervention is difficult as cardiovascular abnormalities are subtle. Although transthoracic echocardiography may be used to detect sub-clinical abnormalities, it has well-known problems with reproducibility that limit its ability to accurately detect these changes. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the reference standard method for assessing blood flow, cardiac structure and function. Furthermore, recent innovations enable the assessment of radial and longitudinal myocardial velocity, such that detection of sub-clinical changes is now possible. Thus, CMR may be ideal for cardiovascular assessment in pediatric CKD. This study aims to comprehensively assess cardiovascular function in pediatric CKD using CMR and determine its relationship with CKD severity. Methods: A total of 120 children (40 mild, 40 moderate, 20 severe pre-dialysis CKD subjects and 20 healthy controls) underwent CMR with non-invasive blood pressure (BP) measurements. Cardiovascular parameters measured included systemic vascular resistance (SVR), total arterial compliance (TAC), left ventricular (LV) structure, ejection fraction (EF), cardiac timings, radial and longitudinal systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Between group comparisons and regression modelling were used to identify abnormalities in CKD and determine the effects of renal severity on myocardial function. Results: The elevation in mean BP in CKD was accompanied by significantly increased afterload (SVR), without evidence of arterial stiffness (TAC) or increased fluid overload. Left ventricular volumes and global function were not abnormal in CKD. However, there was evidence of LV remodelling, prolongation of isovolumic relaxation time and reduced systolic and diastolic myocardial velocities. Conclusion: Abnormal cardiovascular function is evident in pre-dialysis pediatric CKD. Novel CMR biomarkers may be useful for the detection of subtle abnormalities in this population. Further studies are needed to determine to prognostic value of these biomarkers.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arterial stiffness", "Chronic renal failure", "Hypertension", "Myocardial impairment", "Pediatrics", "Systemic vascular resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Blood Vessels", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Case-Control Studies", "Child", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Heart", "Hemodynamics", "Humans", "Kidney", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Myocardial Contraction", "Phenotype", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prognosis", "Renal Insufficiency, Chronic", "Risk Factors", "Severity of Illness Index", "Ventricular Function, Left", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044754324", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiological and Ultrasound Technology", "HEAL", "3614"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56976091500": {"Name": "Cheang M.H.", "AuthorID": "56976091500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "56609890400": {"Name": "Barber N.J.", "AuthorID": "56609890400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57087011000": {"Name": "Khushnood A.", "AuthorID": "57087011000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "37034141400": {"Name": "Hauser J.A.", "AuthorID": "37034141400", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "6602362169": {"Name": "Kowalik G.T.", "AuthorID": "6602362169", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "36605240600": {"Name": "Steeden J.A.", "AuthorID": "36605240600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Imaging, UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science"}, "57213375872": {"Name": "Quail M.A.", "AuthorID": "57213375872", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7801671480": {"Name": "Muthurangu V.", "AuthorID": "7801671480", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "16409790600": {"Name": "Tullus K.", "AuthorID": "16409790600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "13604772600": {"Name": "Hothi D.", "AuthorID": "13604772600", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
