Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.Small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycan (SLRP) family proteins play important roles in a number of biological events. Here, we demonstrate that the SLRP family member Asporin (ASPN) plays a crucial role in the early stages of eye development in Xenopus embryos. During embryogenesis, ASPN is broadly expressed in the neuroectoderm of the embryo. Overexpression of ASPN causes the induction of ectopic eyes. By contrast, blocking ASPN function with a morpholino oligonucleotide (ASPN-MO) inhibits eye formation, indicating that ASPN is an essential factor for eye development. Detailed molecular analyses revealed that ASPN interacts with insulin growth factor receptor (IGFR) and is essential for activating the IGF receptor-mediated intracellular signalling pathway. Moreover, ASPN perturbed the Wnt, BMP and Activin signalling pathways, suggesting that ASPN thereby creates a favourable environment in which the IGF signal can dominate. ASPN is thus a novel secreted molecule essential for eye induction through the coordination of multiple signalling pathways.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anterior-posterior polarity", "ASPN", "Eye induction", "IGF", "Xenopus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blotting, Western", "Extracellular Matrix Proteins", "Eye", "Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental", "Immunohistochemistry", "Immunoprecipitation", "In Situ Hybridization", "Morpholinos", "Neural Plate", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Signal Transduction", "Xenopus", "Xenopus Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943563423", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"56895998200": {"Name": "Luehders K.", "AuthorID": "56895998200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Biology and Therapeutic unit (ORBIT), Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "6602070154": {"Name": "Sasai N.", "AuthorID": "6602070154", "AffiliationID": "60025017", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST)"}, "56319160300": {"Name": "Davaapil H.", "AuthorID": "56319160300", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Biology and Therapeutic unit (ORBIT), Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7003890345": {"Name": "Hiura H.", "AuthorID": "7003890345", "AffiliationID": "60180317", "AffiliationName": "Department of Informative Genetics, Environment and Genome Research Center, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine"}, "56896167700": {"Name": "Brah T.", "AuthorID": "56896167700", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Ocular Biology and Therapeutic unit (ORBIT), Institute of Ophthalmology, University College London"}, "7004830285": {"Name": "Ohnuma S.I.", "AuthorID": "7004830285", "AffiliationID": "60031101, 60031668", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, The Hutchison/MRC Research Centre, University of Cambridge"}, "56896106100": {"Name": "Kurosawa-Yoshida M.", "AuthorID": "56896106100", "AffiliationID": "60028476", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Oncology, Aichi Cancer Center"}}}
