The observation of the ammonia doublet led to attempts to find a phosphine analogous, but these have so far failed due to its considerably higher barrier. Full dimensional, variational nuclear motion calculations are used to predict splittings as a function of excitation energy. Simulated spectra suggest that such splittings should be observable in the near infrared via overtones of the \u03bd2 bending mode starting with 4\u03bd2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Bending modes", "Molecular spectra", "Near Infrared", "Simulated spectra", "Splittings", "Variational nuclear motion calculations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986247550", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"55699960200": {"Name": "Sousa-Silva C.", "AuthorID": "55699960200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
