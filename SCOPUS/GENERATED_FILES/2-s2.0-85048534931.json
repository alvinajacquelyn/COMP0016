It is shown that the tube separation and tube thickness of the inner elements have a significant effect on the confinement loss and effective material loss of the fiber in the THz band. Using TOPAS copolymer, the proposed fiber was optimized for operation at 1 THz and it is predicted from numerical simulations that loss can be reduced to as low as 0.05 dB/m with a 0.6 THz wide dispersion flattened bandwidth.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dispersion", "Fiber design and fabrication", "Fiber properties", "THz fiber"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antiresonant", "Cladding tubes", "Confinement loss", "Effective materials", "Fiber design and fabrication", "Fiber properties", "Hollow core fiber", "Transmission loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048534931", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56415113600": {"Name": "Hasanuzzaman G.", "AuthorID": "56415113600", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "57191495040": {"Name": "Iezekiel S.", "AuthorID": "57191495040", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Cyprus"}, "36621063300": {"Name": "Markos C.", "AuthorID": "36621063300", "AffiliationID": "60011373", "AffiliationName": "DTU Fotonik, Department of Photonics Engineering, Technical University of Denmark"}, "55633909500": {"Name": "Habib M.", "AuthorID": "55633909500", "AffiliationID": "60022144", "AffiliationName": "The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida"}}}
