Neonatal sepsis remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality at a global level, with evidence that MDR bacteria play an increasing role. The evidence for use of fosfomycin in neonatal subjects is limited. We summarise current knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes for the use of fosfomycin in neonatal sepsis and issues specific to neonatal physiology. While fosfomycin has a broad range of coverage, we evaluate the extent to which it may be effective against MDR bacteria in a neonatal setting, in light of recent evidence suggesting it to be most effective when administered in combination with other antibiotics. Given the urgency of clinical demand for treatment of MDR bacterial sepsis, we outline directions for further work, including the need for future clinical trials in this at-risk population.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Bacteria", "Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial", "Fosfomycin", "Humans", "Infant, Newborn", "Neonatal Sepsis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018242786", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"57192296225": {"Name": "Li G.", "AuthorID": "57192296225", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, Institute of Infection and Immunity, St George\u2019s, University of London"}, "8702431000": {"Name": "Standing J.F.", "AuthorID": "8702431000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "55751670800": {"Name": "Bielicki J.", "AuthorID": "55751670800", "AffiliationID": "60023588, 60006655", "AffiliationName": "Division of Paediatric Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, University of Basel Children\u2019s Hospital (UKBB)"}, "7006029267": {"Name": "Heath P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006029267", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, Institute of Infection and Immunity, St George\u2019s, University of London"}, "57203106412": {"Name": "Sharland M.", "AuthorID": "57203106412", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Infectious Diseases Research Group, Institute of Infection and Immunity, St George\u2019s, University of London"}, "35344753400": {"Name": "Hope W.", "AuthorID": "35344753400", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "Antimicrobial Pharmacodynamics and Therapeutics, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "7006245836": {"Name": "van den Anker J.", "AuthorID": "7006245836", "AffiliationID": "60005723", "AffiliationName": "Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Children\u2019s National Health System"}}}
