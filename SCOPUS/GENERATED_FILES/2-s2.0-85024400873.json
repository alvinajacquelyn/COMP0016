Grafted CNTs with diameters 55 nm \u00b1 36 nm and lengths around 10 \u03bcm were well attached to the carbon fibre surface, and were grown without the requirement for protective barrier coatings. The grafted CNTs increased the surface area to 185 m2 g-1 compared to the as-received sized carbon fibre 0.24 m2 g-1. The approach is not restricted to batch systems and has the potential to improve CNT grafted carbon fibre production for continuous processing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["carbon fibre", "carbon nanotube", "chemical vapour deposition", "potential difference enhanced", "synthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chemical vapour deposition", "Continuous processing", "Counter electrodes", "Fibre production", "Fibre surfaces", "Graphite foils", "Potential difference", "Protective barrier"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85024400873", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56379720700": {"Name": "Anthony D.B.", "AuthorID": "56379720700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Composites Centre, Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London"}, "49964365700": {"Name": "Qian H.", "AuthorID": "49964365700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Nanostructured Hierarchical Assemblies and Composites (NanoHAC) Group, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "56330351900": {"Name": "Clancy A.J.", "AuthorID": "56330351900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Nanostructured Hierarchical Assemblies and Composites (NanoHAC) Group, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7103369266": {"Name": "Shaffer M.S.P.", "AuthorID": "7103369266", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Nanostructured Hierarchical Assemblies and Composites (NanoHAC) Group, Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London"}, "7004175356": {"Name": "Bismarck A.", "AuthorID": "7004175356", "AffiliationID": "60025988, 60018163", "AffiliationName": "Polymer and Composites Engineering (PaCE) Group, Institute of Materials Chemistry, Facility of Chemistry, Universitat Wien"}, "57203253208": {"Name": "Greenhalgh E.S.", "AuthorID": "57203253208", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Composites Centre, Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London"}}}
