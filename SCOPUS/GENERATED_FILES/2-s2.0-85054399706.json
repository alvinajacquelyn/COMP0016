Through regression analysis, a function that captures the relationship between the variables is fitted to the data. Many methods from literature tackle this problem with various degrees of difficulty. Some simple methods include linear regression and least squares, while some are more complicated such as support vector regression. Piecewise or segmented regression is a method of analysis that partitions the independent variables into intervals and a function is fitted to each interval. In this work, the Optimal Piecewise Linear Regression Analysis (OPLRA) model is used from literature to tackle the problem of segmented analysis. This model is a mathematical programming approach that is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem that optimally partitions the data into multiple regions and calculates the regression coefficients, while minimising the Mean Absolute Error of the fitting. However, the number of regions is a known priori. For this work, an extension of the model is proposed that can optimally decide on the number of regions using information criteria. Specifically, the Akaike Information Criterion is used and the objective is to minimise its value. By using the criterion, the model no longer needs a heuristic approach to decide on the number of regions and it also deals with the problem of overfitting and model complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Information criterion", "Machine learning", "Mathematical programming", "Optimisation", "Regression analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Akaike information criterion", "Independent variables", "Information criterion", "Mixed integer linear programming problems", "Optimisations", "Piecewise linear regression", "Regression coefficient", "Support vector regression (SVR)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054399706", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"]], "AuthorData": {"36738892600": {"Name": "Gkioulekas I.", "AuthorID": "36738892600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}, "7003608896": {"Name": "Papageorgiou L.G.", "AuthorID": "7003608896", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering, UCL (University College London)"}}}
