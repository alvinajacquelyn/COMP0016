All rights reserved.This article is a case study in the creation, transmission and evolution of calendar tables in medieval and early modern Jewish sources. It looks at calendar tables in Arba ah Turim by Jacob ben Asher (early fourteenth century), one of the most influential rabbinic codes of law. Calendar tables in printed editions of Arbaah Turim (Tur Orah Hayyim, chapter 428) deviate from the normative rabbinic calendar and can lead to celebrating religious holidays at the wrong times. The inclusion of non-standard tables in an authoritative code of law has long raised questions about their authenticity. This article examines the history of calendar tables in Tur Orah Hayyim by investigating all extant manuscripts and fifteenth-to sixteenth-century printed editions of the code. The article highlights the unstable connection of calendar tables with authorial compositions and the lack of calendar expertise among copyists and users of calendar tables.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046549386", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Religious Studies", "ARTS", "1212"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"57008317600": {"Name": "Vidro N.", "AuthorID": "57008317600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
