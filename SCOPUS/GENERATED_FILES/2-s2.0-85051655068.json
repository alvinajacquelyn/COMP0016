In particular, the distributed remote radio heads (RRHs), which are conventionally distributed in the network to enhance the performance, are also used to increase the energy harvesting (EH) at the energy-constrained users. Based on this idea, the network area is divided into two zones, namely: 1) EH zone and 2) interference zone. The users in the EH zones are guaranteed to harvest sufficient energy from the closed RRH, while the users in the interference zones harvest energy from the surrounding RRHs. A harvest-then-transmit protocol is adopted, where in the power transfer phase the multiple antennas RRHs broadcast energy signals to the users. In the information transmission phase, the users utilize the harvested energy to transmit their signals to the RRHs. In addition, zero-forcing is applied at the RRHs receivers, to mitigate the interference. The system spectral efficiency is evaluated in two different scenarios based on the channel state information (CSI) namely: 1) CSI is unknown at the RRHs 2) CSI is perfectly known at the RRHs. In contrast to conventional EH-muliple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, performance analysis of EH DAS-MIMO is a challenging problem, because the channels are characterized by non-identical path-loss and EH effects which make the classical analytical methods non-tractable. In light of this, new analytical expressions of the ergodic spectral efficiency are derived and then Monte Carlo simulations are provided to verify the accuracy of our analysis. The effects of main system parameters on the EH-DAS performance are investigated. The results show that there is an optimal value of the EH time for each users locations that maximizes the system performance. In addition, size of the EH-zone area depends on the required harvested power at the users which is dependent essentially on the target spectral efficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CSI", "DAS", "Spectral efficiency", "Wireless power transfer", "Zero forcing"], "IndexKeywords": ["MIMO communication", "Spectral efficiencies", "Wireless communications", "Wireless power transfer", "Zero-forcing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051655068", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"57044158800": {"Name": "Salem A.", "AuthorID": "57044158800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "8668799900": {"Name": "Musavian L.", "AuthorID": "8668799900", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, University of Essex"}, "8914581700": {"Name": "Hamdi K.", "AuthorID": "8914581700", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Manchester"}}}
