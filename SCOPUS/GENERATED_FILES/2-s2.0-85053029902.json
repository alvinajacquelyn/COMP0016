The genetic association of Gabra2 haplotypes with cocaine addiction appears to be evident primarily in individuals who had experienced childhood trauma. Given this association of childhood trauma, cocaine abuse and the Gabra2 haplotypes, we have explored in a mouse model of early life adversity (ELA) whether such events influence the behavioral effects of cocaine and if, as suggested by the human studies, \u03b12-GABAARs in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) are involved in these perturbed behaviors. In adult mice prior ELA caused a selective decrease of accumbal \u03b12-subunit mRNA, resulting in a selective decrease in the number and size of the \u03b12-subunit (but not the \u03b11-subunit) immunoreactive clusters in NAc core medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Functionally, in adult MSNs ELA decreased the amplitude and frequency of GABAAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs), a profile similar to that of \u03b12 \u201cknock-out\u201d (\u03b12\u2212/\u2212) mice. Behaviourally, adult male ELA and \u03b12\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited an enhanced locomotor response to acute cocaine and blunted sensitisation upon repeated cocaine administration, when compared to their appropriate controls. Collectively, these findings reveal a neurobiological mechanism which may relate to the clinical observation that early trauma increases the risk for substance abuse disorder (SAD) in individuals harbouring haplotypic variations in the Gabra2 gene.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cocaine", "Early-life adversity", "Early-life stress", "GABAA receptors", "Nucleus accumbens"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Central Nervous System Sensitization", "Cocaine", "Female", "Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Locomotion", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Knockout", "Miniature Postsynaptic Potentials", "Neurons", "Nucleus Accumbens", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Stress, Physiological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053029902", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57095367600": {"Name": "Mitchell S.J.", "AuthorID": "57095367600", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience, Medical Research Institute, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, Dundee University"}, "55954258300": {"Name": "Maguire E.P.", "AuthorID": "55954258300", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience, Medical Research Institute, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, Dundee University"}, "55957282000": {"Name": "Cunningham L.", "AuthorID": "55957282000", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience, Medical Research Institute, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, Dundee University"}, "23477090100": {"Name": "Gunn B.G.", "AuthorID": "23477090100", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience, Medical Research Institute, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, Dundee University"}, "7004615923": {"Name": "Belelli D.", "AuthorID": "7004615923", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience, Medical Research Institute, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, Dundee University"}, "7401837250": {"Name": "Lambert J.J.", "AuthorID": "7401837250", "AffiliationID": "60171138, 60008877", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neuroscience, Medical Research Institute, Ninewells Hospital & Medical School, Dundee University"}, "53868117800": {"Name": "Linke M.", "AuthorID": "53868117800", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Genetics, Mainz University, Medical Center"}, "56257295200": {"Name": "Zechner U.", "AuthorID": "56257295200", "AffiliationID": "60031216", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Human Genetics, Mainz University, Medical Center"}, "6506457509": {"Name": "Swinny J.D.", "AuthorID": "6506457509", "AffiliationID": "60025475", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Biomedical & Biomolecular Sciences, School of Pharmacy & Biomedical Sciences, University of Portsmouth"}, "13808193500": {"Name": "Dixon C.I.", "AuthorID": "13808193500", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "35515617700": {"Name": "King S.L.", "AuthorID": "35515617700", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}, "57210530017": {"Name": "Stephens D.N.", "AuthorID": "57210530017", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Sussex"}}}
