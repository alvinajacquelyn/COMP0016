Published by Elsevier Ltd.The snake neurotoxin \u03b1-bungarotoxin (\u03b1-Bgtx) is a competitive antagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and is widely used to study their function and cell-surface expression. Increasingly, \u03b1-Bgtx is also used as an imaging tool for fluorophore-labelling studies, and given the structural conservation within the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family, we assessed whether \u03b1-Bgtx could bind to recombinant and native \u03b3-aminobutyric type-A receptors (GABAARs). Applying fluorophore-linked \u03b1-Bgtx to recombinant \u03b1x\u03b21/2\u03b32 GABAARs expressed in HEK-293 cells enabled clear cell-surface labelling of \u03b12\u03b21/2\u03b32 contrasting with the weaker staining of \u03b11/4\u03b21/2\u03b32, and no labelling for \u03b13/5/6\u03b21/2\u03b32. The labelling of \u03b12\u03b22\u03b32 was abolished by bicuculline, a competitive antagonist at GABAARs, and by d-tubocurarine (d-Tc), which acts in a similar manner at nAChRs and GABAARs. Labelling by \u03b1-Bgtx was also reduced by GABA, suggesting that the GABA binding site at the receptor \u03b2-\u03b1 subunit interface forms part of the \u03b1-Bgtx binding site. Using whole-cell recording, high concentrations of \u03b1-Bgtx (20 \u03bcM) inhibited GABA-activated currents at all \u03b1x\u03b22\u03b32 receptors examined, but at lower concentrations (5 \u03bcM), \u03b1-Bgtx was selective for \u03b12\u03b22\u03b32. Using \u03b1-Bgtx, at low concentrations, permitted the selective inhibition of \u03b12 subunit-containing GABAARs in hippocampal dentate gyrus granule cells, reducing synaptic current amplitudes without affecting the GABA-mediated tonic current. In conclusion, \u03b1-Bgtx can act as an inhibitor at recombinant and native GABAARs and may be used as a selective tool to inhibit phasic but not tonic currents in the hippocampus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dentate gyrus", "Electrophysiology", "GABA receptor", "Immunofluorescence", "Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor", "\u03b1-bungarotoxin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Brain", "Bungarotoxins", "Embryo, Mammalian", "GABA Antagonists", "gamma-Aminobutyric Acid", "Humans", "In Vitro Techniques", "Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potentials", "Male", "Membrane Potentials", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Neurons", "Nicotinic Antagonists", "Patch-Clamp Techniques", "Protein Binding", "Rats", "Receptors, GABA-A", "Receptors, Nicotinic", "Tubocurarine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922484016", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"56654984900": {"Name": "Hannan S.", "AuthorID": "56654984900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7006427065": {"Name": "Mortensen M.", "AuthorID": "7006427065", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7102576252": {"Name": "Smart T.G.", "AuthorID": "7102576252", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
