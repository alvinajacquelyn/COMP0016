Japan was the first country in the world to introduce criteria for recognizing overwork-related CVDs in 1961. Taiwan followed Japan in putting in place new policies and then updating these in 2010. We aimed to investigate the effect of introducing the new criteria for recognizing overwork-related CVDs in both countries. We defined the baseline period as the 5 years before launch of the new criteria, then collected data to 5 years after the new criteria. We applied a Poisson regression model to analyze the longitudinal change in rates of overwork-related CVDs before and after, adjusting for indicators of working conditions. Implementation of the new criteria was associated with a 2.58-fold increase in the rate of overwork-related CVDs (p-value < 0.05). However, the examined policy framework in Taiwan still appears to miss a substantial number of cases compared to that are captured by a similar policy framework used to capture overwork-related CVD rates in Japan by a factor of 0.42 (p-value < 0.05). Accordingly, we make a case for enhancements of Taiwan's system for reporting and recognizing overwork-related diseases and deaths.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039070678", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"15123000400": {"Name": "Lin R.T.", "AuthorID": "15123000400", "AffiliationID": "60006988", "AffiliationName": "Department of Occupational Safety and Health, China Medical University"}, "56953688700": {"Name": "Lin C.K.", "AuthorID": "56953688700", "AffiliationID": "60032499", "AffiliationName": "Department of Environmental Health, Harvard T.H.
