Such continuous Petri nets are an appealing object to study, since they over-approximate the set of reachable configurations of their discrete counterparts, and their reachability problem is known to be decidable in polynomial time. The starting point of this article is to show that the reachability relation for continuous Petri nets is definable by a sentence of linear size in the existential theory of the rationals with addition and order. Using this characterization, we obtain decidability and complexity results for a number of classical decision problems for continuous Petri nets. In particular, we settle the open problem about the precise complexity of reachability set inclusion. Finally, we show how continuous Petri nets can be incorporated inside the classical backward coverability algorithm for discrete Petri nets as a pruning heuristic to tackle the symbolic state explosion problem. The cornerstone of the approach we present is that our logical characterization enables us to leverage the power of modern SMT-solvers to yield a highly performant and robust decision procedure for coverability in Petri nets.We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a set of standard benchmarks from the literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Arithmetic theories", "Coverability", "Linear programming", "Petri nets", "Vector addition systems"], "IndexKeywords": ["Classical decision problems", "Continuous Petri net", "Coverability", "Discrete Petri nets", "Logical characterization", "Reachability problem", "Reachability relations", "Vector addition systems"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027415385", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Logic", "MATH", "2609"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"]], "AuthorData": {"55347391600": {"Name": "Blondin M.", "AuthorID": "55347391600", "AffiliationID": "60019722", "AffiliationName": "Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen"}, "7005243284": {"Name": "Finkel A.", "AuthorID": "7005243284", "AffiliationID": "60105997", "AffiliationName": "LSV, CNRS and ENS Cachan"}, "55831988100": {"Name": "Haddad S.", "AuthorID": "55831988100", "AffiliationID": "60105997", "AffiliationName": "LSV, CNRS and ENS Cachan"}, "35090201500": {"Name": "Haase C.", "AuthorID": "35090201500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"}}}
