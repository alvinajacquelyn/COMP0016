Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a condition characterized by micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate and related to a difficult airway. Both the Airtraq\u2122 and GlideScope\u00ae have never been previously directly compared in PRS. Our aim was to evaluate the performance of these two airway devices in a PRS manikin for ethical and practical reasons. Between April and July 2017, 26, pediatric intensive care clinical fellows or trainees from a tertiary pediatric center were recruited to participate. In this prospective and randomized crossover trial, all participants first set up the Airtraq\u2122 and the GlideScope\u00ae and then used these videolaryngoscopes to intubate an AirSim\u00ae PRS manikin. Our primary outcome measure was the duration of the successful intubation attempt. Duration of the successful intubation attempt was 18.1 (14.2\u201334.9 [10.2\u201351.3]) s for the Airtraq\u2122 compared to 31.1 (18.7\u201355.6 [6.2\u2013119]) s for the GlideScope\u00ae (p = 0.045). Setup time was 50.0 \u00b1 6.9 s for the Airtraq\u2122 and 27.8 \u00b1 8.6 s for the GlideScope\u00ae (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Even though setup time was longer, the characteristics of intubation performance were superior with the Airtraq\u2122 relative to the GlideScope\u00ae in an AirSim\u00ae PRS manikin.What is Known:\u2022 Several case reports have described the successful use of Airtraq\u2122 to intubate children with Pierre Robin sequence.\u2022 The GlideScope\u00ae has demonstrated similar rates of first-attempt successful intubation to flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy in a Pierre Robin sequence manikin.What is New:\u2022 In the hands of pediatric non-airway specialists, the characteristics of intubation performance, including the duration of the successful intubation attempt, are superior with the Airtraq\u2122 compared with the GlideScope\u00ae in a Pierre Robin sequence manikin.\u2022 Setup time for the Airtraq\u2122 is, however, longer relative to that for the GlideScope\u00ae.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Intubation", "Laryngoscopy", "Manikins", "Pediatrics", "Pierre Robin syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": ["Airway Obstruction", "Child", "Cross-Over Studies", "Humans", "Intubation, Intratracheal", "Laryngoscopes", "Laryngoscopy", "Manikins", "Time Factors", "Video-Assisted Surgery"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85066130594", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"57195348065": {"Name": "Desai N.", "AuthorID": "57195348065", "AffiliationID": "60005518", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthetics, Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57195185403": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "57195185403", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57208927917": {"Name": "Priddis K.", "AuthorID": "57208927917", "AffiliationID": "100733378", "AffiliationName": "Children\u2019s Acute Transport Service"}, "56801266700": {"Name": "Ray S.", "AuthorID": "56801266700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Respiratory, Critical Care and Anaesthesia Section, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57191371896": {"Name": "Chigaru L.", "AuthorID": "57191371896", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthetics, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
