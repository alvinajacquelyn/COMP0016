The objective of this report is to produce evidence-based recommendations to guide rheumatologists and other health professionals in the treatment and follow-up of patients with FMF. A multidisciplinary panel, including rheumatologists, internists, paediatricians, a nurse, a methodologist and a patient representative, was assembled. Panellists came from the Eastern Mediterranean area, Europe and North America. A preliminary systematic literature search on the pharmacological treatment of FMF was performed following which the expert group convened to define aims, scope and users of the guidelines and established the need for additional reviews on controversial topics. In a second meeting, recommendations were discussed and refined in light of available evidence. Finally, agreement with the recommendations was obtained from a larger group of experts through a Delphi survey. The level of evidence (LoE) and grade of recommendation (GR) were then incorporated. The final document comprises 18 recommendations, each presented with its degree of agreement (0-10), LoE, GR and rationale. The degree of agreement was greater than 7/10 in all instances. The more controversial statements were those related to follow-up and dose change, for which supporting evidence is limited. A set of widely accepted recommendations for the treatment and monitoring of FMF is presented, supported by the best available evidence and expert opinion. It is believed that these recommendations will be useful in guiding physicians in the care of patients with FMF.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Amyloidosis", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Antirheumatic Agents", "Colchicine", "Delphi Technique", "Drug-Induced Liver Injury", "Europe", "Familial Mediterranean Fever", "Glucocorticoids", "Humans", "Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein", "Tubulin Modulators"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961990789", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Rheumatology", "MEDI", "2745"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"]], "AuthorData": {"7103280649": {"Name": "Ozen S.", "AuthorID": "7103280649", "AffiliationID": "60020484", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Rheumatology, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine"}, "6507346726": {"Name": "Demirkaya E.", "AuthorID": "6507346726", "AffiliationID": "60026716", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, G\u00fclhane Military Medical Academy, FMF Arthritis Vasculitis and Orphan Disease Research Center (FAVOR)"}, "6701534587": {"Name": "Erer B.", "AuthorID": "6701534587", "AffiliationID": "60012324, 60028502", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul Faculty of Medicine"}, "7005916345": {"Name": "Livneh A.", "AuthorID": "7005916345", "AffiliationID": "60005037, 60005681, 60011766, 60091819", "AffiliationName": "Heller Institute of Medical Research and Medicine F, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University"}, "7005411729": {"Name": "Ben-Chetrit E.", "AuthorID": "7005411729", "AffiliationID": "60000087", "AffiliationName": "Rheumatology Unit, Hadassah-Hebrew University, Medical Center"}, "36004587700": {"Name": "Giancane G.", "AuthorID": "36004587700", "AffiliationID": "60016041", "AffiliationName": "Pediatria II-Reumatologia, Istituto G.
