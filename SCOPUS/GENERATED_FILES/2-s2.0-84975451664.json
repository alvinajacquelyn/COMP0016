Controlling nucleus size is a particular challenge in early development, where the nucleus must downscale in size with progressive reductive cell divisions. Here we use live and fixed imaging, micromanipulation approaches, and small molecule analyses during preimplantation mouse development to probe the mechanisms by which nucleus size is determined. We find a close correlation between cell and nuclear size at any given developmental stage, and show that experimental cytoplasmic reduction can alter nuclear size, together indicating that cell size helps dictate nuclear proportions. Additionally, however, by creating embryos with over-sized blastomeres we present evidence of a developmental program that drives nuclear downscaling independently of cell size. We show that this developmental program does not correspond with nuclear import rates, but provide evidence that PKC activity may contribute to this mechanism. We propose a model in which nuclear size regulation during early development is a multi-mode process wherein nucleus size is set by cytoplasmic factors, and fine-tuned on a cell-by-cell basis according to cell size.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Blastomeres", "Cell Nucleus", "Cytoplasm", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Embryonic Development", "Mice", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Protein Kinase C", "Protein Kinase Inhibitors", "Zygote"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84975451664", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6505474301": {"Name": "Tsichlaki E.", "AuthorID": "6505474301", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "6602891780": {"Name": "Fitzharris G.", "AuthorID": "6602891780", "AffiliationID": "60009507", "AffiliationName": "Department Obst\u00e9rique-Gyn\u00e9cologie, Universit\u00e9 de Montre\u00e1l"}}}
