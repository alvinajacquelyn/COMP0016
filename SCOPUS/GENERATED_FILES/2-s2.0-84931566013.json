Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: We investigated whether parental eating disorders (ED) predict ED in children, using a large multigeneration register-based sample. Method: We used a subset of the Stockholm Youth Cohort born 1984-1995 and resident in Stockholm County in 2001-2007 (N = 286 232), The exposure was a diagnosed eating disorder in a parent; the outcome was any eating disorder diagnosis in their offspring, given by a specialist clinician, or inferred from an appointment at a specialist eating disorder clinic. A final study sample of 158 697 (55.4%) had data on these variables and confounding factors and contributed a total of 886 241 person years to the analysis. Results: We found good evidence in support of the hypothesis that ED in either parent are independently associated with ED in their female children (HR 1.97 (95% CI: 1.17-3.33), P = 0.01) and that ED in mothers are independently associated with ED in their female children (HR 2.35 (95% CI: 1.39-3.97) P = 0.001). Numbers were too low to permit separate analysis of ED in parents and their male children. Conclusion: Eating disorders in parents were associated with ED in children. This study adds to our knowledge about the intergenerational transmission of ED, which will help identify high-risk groups and brings about the possibility of targeted prevention.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anorexia nervosa", "Bulimia nervosa", "Eating disorder not otherwise specified", "Eating disorders", "Intergenerational"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Child Behavior", "Child of Impaired Parents", "Cohort Studies", "Feeding and Eating Disorders", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Parent-Child Relations", "Parents", "Sweden"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84931566013", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"36975240400": {"Name": "Bould H.", "AuthorID": "36975240400", "AffiliationID": "60026851, 60000940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford"}, "55988253600": {"Name": "Sovio U.", "AuthorID": "55988253600", "AffiliationID": "60119998", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, The Rosie Hospital"}, "8932321000": {"Name": "Koupil I.", "AuthorID": "8932321000", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Health Equity Studies, Stockholm University/Karolinska Institute"}, "6701846593": {"Name": "Dalman C.", "AuthorID": "6701846593", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet"}, "7006321127": {"Name": "Magnusson C.", "AuthorID": "7006321127", "AffiliationID": "60012311", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology, Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institutet"}, "16031429800": {"Name": "Micali N.", "AuthorID": "16031429800", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural and Brain Sciences Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mental Health Sciences Unit, Faculty of Brain Sciences, UCL"}}}
