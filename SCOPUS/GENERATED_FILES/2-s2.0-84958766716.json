PENTA is a framework for conceptually and computationally linking communicative meanings to fine-grained prosodic details, based on an articulatory-functional view of speech. Target Approximation simulates the articulatory realisation of underlying pitch targets - the prosodic primitives in the framework. Parallel Encoding provides an operational scheme that enables simultaneous encoding of multiple communicative functions. We also outline how PENTA can be computationally tested with a set of software tools. With the help of one of the tools, we offer a PENTA-based hypothetical account of the Greek intonational patterns reported by Arvaniti & Ladd, showing how it is possible to predict the prosodic shapes of an utterance based on the lexical and postlexical meanings it conveys.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958766716", "SubjectAreas": [["Language and Linguistics", "ARTS", "1203"], ["Linguistics and Language", "SOCI", "3310"]], "AuthorData": {"55695016900": {"Name": "Xu Y.", "AuthorID": "55695016900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Speech, Hearing and Phonetic Sciences, University College London, Chandler House"}, "55658303800": {"Name": "Lee A.", "AuthorID": "55658303800", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Linguistics, University of Hong Kong, Run Run Shaw Tower"}, "24833387100": {"Name": "Prom-On S.", "AuthorID": "24833387100", "AffiliationID": "60008786", "AffiliationName": "King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi"}, "55717265000": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "55717265000", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "Department of Language and Linguistics, University of Essex"}}}
