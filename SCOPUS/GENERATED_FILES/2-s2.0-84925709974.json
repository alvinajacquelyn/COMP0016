Importance of the immune system in the gut is endorsed by the presence of IBD-like symptoms in several primary immunodeficiencies. A fraction of early-onset IBDs presenting with more severe disease course and incomplete response to conventional treatment is assumed to be inherited in a Mendelian fashion, as exemplified by the recent discovery of interleukin (IL)-10 (receptor) deficiency. Methods: We analyzed a patient born to consanguineous parents suffering from severe intestinal manifestations since 6 months of age and later diagnosed as IBD. Eventually, she developed autoimmune manifestations including thyroiditis and type I diabetes at the age of 6 and 9 years, respectively. Combined single-nucleotide polymorphism array-based homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing was performed to identify the underlying genetic defect. Protein structural predictions were calculated using I-TASSER. Immunoblot was performed to assess protein expression. Flow cytometric analysis was applied to investigate B-cell subpopulations. Results: We identified a homozygous missense mutation (p.Ile2824Pro) in lipopolysaccharide-responsive and beige-like anchor (LRBA) affecting the C-terminal WD40 domain of the protein. In contrast to previously published LRBA-deficient patients, the mutant protein was expressed at similar levels to healthy controls. Immunophenotyping of the index patient revealed normal B-cell subpopulations except increased CD21low B cells. Conclusions: We describe a patient with a novel missense mutation in LRBA who presented with IBD-like symptoms at early age, illustrating that LRBA deficiency should be considered in the differential diagnosis for IBD(-like) disease even in the absence of overt immunodeficiency.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autoimmunity", "Exome sequencing", "Inflammatory bowel disease", "LRBA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Blotting, Western", "Codon, Nonsense", "Exome", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Immunoenzyme Techniques", "Infant", "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "Phenotype", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925709974", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"56293986300": {"Name": "Serwas N.K.", "AuthorID": "56293986300", "AffiliationID": "60003156", "AffiliationName": "CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "55358898800": {"Name": "Santos-Valente E.", "AuthorID": "55358898800", "AffiliationID": "60003156", "AffiliationName": "CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Austrian Academy of Sciences"}, "23472047500": {"Name": "Boztug K.", "AuthorID": "23472047500", "AffiliationID": "60011394, 60026929", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6604072273": {"Name": "Kansu A.", "AuthorID": "6604072273", "AffiliationID": "60012603", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Ankara University"}, "6507620559": {"Name": "Kulo\u01e7lu Z.", "AuthorID": "6507620559", "AffiliationID": "60012603", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Ankara University"}, "56113307600": {"Name": "Demir A.", "AuthorID": "56113307600", "AffiliationID": "60012603", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Ankara University"}, "55697653700": {"Name": "Yaman A.", "AuthorID": "55697653700", "AffiliationID": "60012603", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Ankara University"}, "56573440000": {"Name": "Diaz L.Y.G.", "AuthorID": "56573440000", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg"}, "26643476400": {"Name": "Grimbacher B.", "AuthorID": "26643476400", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg"}, "7003798133": {"Name": "Artan R.", "AuthorID": "7003798133", "AffiliationID": "60010104", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Akdeniz University"}, "54390078600": {"Name": "Sayar E.", "AuthorID": "54390078600", "AffiliationID": "60090202", "AffiliationName": "Konya Training and Research Hospital"}, "7004056978": {"Name": "Ensari A.", "AuthorID": "7004056978", "AffiliationID": "60012603, 60027000", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology, Ankara University"}}}
