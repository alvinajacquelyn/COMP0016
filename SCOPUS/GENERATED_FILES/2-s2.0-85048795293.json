However, recent terror attacks and concern over serious violent crime have prompted increased funding for armed officers and even calls for routine arming of police. In this paper, we present results from the first in-depth study of public attitudes towards the arming of more police. Starting from the assumption that most people have little concrete knowledge of the potential benefits and risks of doing so, we show that trust, and particularly affective responses to the idea of armed police, are central in shaping support for the routine arming of more officers. A range of other sociological and psychological variables are also important, but only in as much as they are correlated with trust and, again, particularly affect. Our findings have implications not only for this specific policy development, but also wider consideration of lay reactions to changes in police policy and technology.", "AuthorKeywords": ["affect", "Armed police", "attitudes", "public trust"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048795293", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"54893765200": {"Name": "Yesberg J.A.", "AuthorID": "54893765200", "AffiliationID": "60090044, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}, "30367516400": {"Name": "Bradford B.", "AuthorID": "30367516400", "AffiliationID": "60090044, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science, University College London"}}}
