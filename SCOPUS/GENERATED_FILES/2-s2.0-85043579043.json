The Modern Law Review and The Modern Law Review Limited.This note considers the decision of the Singapore Court of Appeal in ACB v Thomson Medical in which the plaintiff sought damages for the upkeep costs of a child conceived using sperm from someone other than her husband as a result of negligence by a fertility clinic. The Court held that upkeep costs could not be recovered as a matter of public policy, but recognised a new head of loss, namely damages for loss of genetic affinity. In a controversial ruling, the Court quantified these damages at thirty per cent of the upkeep costs of the child. While holding that punitive damages could be recovered outside the categories recognised in Rookes v Barnard, the Court rejected such an award on the facts of the case.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85043579043", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"57201151035": {"Name": "Foxton T.", "AuthorID": "57201151035", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Pembroke College, University of Oxford"}}}
