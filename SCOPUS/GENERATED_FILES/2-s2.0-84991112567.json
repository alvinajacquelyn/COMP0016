Many of us are beginning to carry multiple mobile devices and we seek to re-evaluate the traditional view of a mobile device as only accepting energy. In our vision, we can leverage the energy stored in our devices to wirelessly distribute energy between our friends, family, colleagues and strangers devices. In this paper we explore the opportunities and interactions presented by such spontaneous energy transfer interactions and present some envisaged collaborative energy sharing futures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Collaborative energy transfer", "Energy sharing", "Inductive power transfer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Energy sharings", "Inductive power transfer", "Task-needs"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991112567", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Software", "COMP", "1712"]], "AuthorData": {"56158143300": {"Name": "Worgan P.", "AuthorID": "56158143300", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Interaction Group, University of Bristol"}, "7201441361": {"Name": "Fraser M.", "AuthorID": "7201441361", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "Bristol Interaction Group, University of Bristol"}, "57215517228": {"Name": "Plasencia D.M.", "AuthorID": "57215517228", "AffiliationID": "60017317", "AffiliationName": "Interact Lab., University of Sussex"}, "56121554600": {"Name": "Knibbe J.", "AuthorID": "56121554600", "AffiliationID": "60030840", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen"}}}
