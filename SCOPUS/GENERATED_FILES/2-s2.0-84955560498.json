Methods: Reliable and validated psychodiagnostic scales including the BDI (Beck Depression Inventory), STAI-Y1 and 2 (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Y; 1 and 2), MMPI-2 (Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory - 2), and QoLIE-31 (Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory - 31) were administered to 20 patients with ADCME, 20 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), and 20 healthy controls. Results: There was a higher prevalence of mood disorders in patients with ADCME compared to patients with JME and healthy controls, particularly depression (p = 0.035 and p = 0.017, respectively) and state anxiety (p = 0.024 and p = 0.019, respectively). Trait anxiety was not different from JME (p = 0.102) but higher than healthy controls (p = 0.017). The myoclonus score positively correlated with both state (rho: 0.58, p = 0.042) and trait anxiety (rho: 0.65, p = 0.011). These psychiatric features were also often associated with pathological traits of personality: paranoid (OR: 25.7, p = 0.003), psychasthenia (OR: 7.0, p = 0.023), schizophrenia (OR: 8.5, p = 0.011), and hypomania (OR: 5.5, p = 0.022). Finally, in patients with ADCME, decreased quality of life correlated with these psychiatric symptoms. Significance: Patients with ADCME show a significant psychiatric burden that impairs their quality of life. A comprehensive psychiatric evaluation should be offered at the time of diagnosis to detect these comorbidities and to treat them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Depression", "Epilepsy", "Myoclonus", "Personality disorders", "Quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Anxiety", "Depression", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Italy", "Male", "Mental Disorders", "Middle Aged", "Mood Disorders", "Myoclonic Epilepsy, Juvenile", "Myoclonus", "Personality Disorders", "Prevalence", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Psychotic Disorders", "Quality of Life", "Tremor", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84955560498", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"14026453100": {"Name": "Coppola A.", "AuthorID": "14026453100", "AffiliationID": "60025153, 60016041", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Neurology and Muscular Diseases Unit, Department of Neurosciences, University of Genoa, G.
