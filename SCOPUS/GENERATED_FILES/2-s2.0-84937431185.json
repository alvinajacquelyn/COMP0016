Using contemporary, clinical data, we report the yield and cost-effectiveness of testing all HIV attendees, two current UK strategies and no LTBI testing. Economic modelling was performed utilising 10-year follow up data from a large HIV clinical cohort. Outcomes were numbers of cases of active TB and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Between 2000 and 2010, 256 people were treated for TB/HIV co-infection. 72 (28%) occurred \u22653 months after HIV diagnosis and may have been prevented by LTBI testing. Between 2000 and 2005, the incremental cost per QALY gained for the British HIV Association (BHIVA) and UK National Institute of Care Excellence (NICE) strategies, and testing all clinic attendees was \u20ac6270, \u20ac6998 and \u20ac33 473, respectively. These rose to \u20ac9332, \u20ac32 564 and \u20ac74 067, respectively, between 2005 and 2010. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that at a threshold of \u20ac24 000 per additional QALY, the most cost-effective strategies would be NICE or testing all in 2000-2005 and BHIVA during 2005-2010. Both UK testing regimens missed cases but are cost-effective compared with no testing. Using recent data, they all became more expensive, suggesting that alternative or more targeted TB testing strategies must be considered.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Cohort Studies", "Coinfection", "Communicable Disease Control", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Incidence", "Latent Tuberculosis", "London", "Mass Screening", "Models, Economic", "Prevalence", "Probability", "Quality-Adjusted Life Years"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937431185", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"55363218700": {"Name": "Capocci S.", "AuthorID": "55363218700", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and Thoracic Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56339842100": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "56339842100", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of HIV and Thoracic Medicine, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005890471": {"Name": "Lipman M.", "AuthorID": "7005890471", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, University College London"}, "7501658889": {"Name": "Smith C.", "AuthorID": "7501658889", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Population Health, University College London"}, "56449994300": {"Name": "Morris S.", "AuthorID": "56449994300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Applied Health Research, University College London"}, "8203699300": {"Name": "Bhagani S.", "AuthorID": "8203699300", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602228387": {"Name": "Cropley I.", "AuthorID": "6602228387", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infectious Diseases, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6602338051": {"Name": "Abubakar I.", "AuthorID": "6602338051", "AffiliationID": "60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit"}}}
