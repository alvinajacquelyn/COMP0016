Here, we report the clinical application of whole exome sequencing for the ultimate diagnosis of a ciliary chondrodysplasia case presented with an initial clinical diagnosis of Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy (ATD, Jeune Syndrome). We have identified a novel homozygous missense mutation in WDR35 (c.206G > A), a gene previously associated with Sensenbrenner Syndrome, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and Short-rib polydactyly syndrome type V. The genetic findings in this family led to the re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis and a differential diagnosis of Sensenbrenner Syndrome was made after cautious re-examination of the patient. Cell culture studies revealed normal subcellular localization of the mutant WDR35 protein in comparison to wildtype protein, pointing towards impaired protein-protein interaction and/or altered cell signaling pathways as a consequence of the mutated allele. This research study highlights the importance of including pathogenic variant identification in the diagnosis pipeline of ciliary chondrodysplasias, especially for clinically not fully defined phenotypes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ciliary chondrodysplasias", "Exome sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Bone and Bones", "Cells, Cultured", "Child", "Ciliopathies", "Craniosynostoses", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Ectodermal Dysplasia", "Ellis-Van Creveld Syndrome", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mutation, Missense", "Pedigree", "Protein Binding", "Protein Transport", "Proteins", "Whole Exome Sequencing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029006264", "SubjectAreas": [["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Genetics (clinical)", "MEDI", "2716"]], "AuthorData": {"55524166800": {"Name": "Antony D.", "AuthorID": "55524166800", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Genome Research, Human Genetics Department, Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS)"}, "55449576400": {"Name": "Melhem M.", "AuthorID": "55449576400", "AffiliationID": "60121864", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Unit, Dasman Diabetes Institute"}, "56540468200": {"Name": "Thomas D.", "AuthorID": "56540468200", "AffiliationID": "60121864", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Unit, Dasman Diabetes Institute"}, "13614098200": {"Name": "Alsmadi O.", "AuthorID": "13614098200", "AffiliationID": "60121864", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomics Unit, Dasman Diabetes Institute"}, "21135514600": {"Name": "Nampoory N.", "AuthorID": "21135514600", "AffiliationID": "60121864", "AffiliationName": "Dasman Diabetes Institute"}, "55503273300": {"Name": "Behbehani K.", "AuthorID": "55503273300", "AffiliationID": "60121864", "AffiliationName": "Dasman Diabetes Institute"}, "6507375825": {"Name": "Bacchelli C.", "AuthorID": "6507375825", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7203017689": {"Name": "James C.T.", "AuthorID": "7203017689", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "7004556611": {"Name": "Beales P.L.", "AuthorID": "7004556611", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57203072549": {"Name": "Hubank M.", "AuthorID": "57203072549", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Genetics and Genomic Medicine, UCL Institute of Child Health"}, "57109624000": {"Name": "Wu K.", "AuthorID": "57109624000", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Genome Research, Human Genetics Department, Radboud University Medical Center, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences (RIMLS)"}, "6603658830": {"Name": "Schmidts M.", "AuthorID": "6603658830", "AffiliationID": "60024805", "AffiliationName": "Center for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Freiburg"}, "6505817047": {"Name": "Mashankar A.", "AuthorID": "6505817047", "AffiliationID": "60121864", "AffiliationName": "Diagnostic Imaging Center, Dasman Diabetes Institute"}}}
