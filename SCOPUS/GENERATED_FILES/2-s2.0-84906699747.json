Each soil was sampled to a depth of ~1m. The maximum soil ages based on 14C analysis of the humin fraction of the soil are 15,600 and 4400years for the Dartmoor and Glen Dye soil profiles, respectively. The measured BET surface areas of the soil minerals are close to 5m2/g in the B and C horizons, but decrease to less than 1m2/g close to the surface. Retrieved geometric surface area normalised mineral dissolution rates are most rapid at the surface and at the bedrock-soil interface; this behaviour is interpreted to stem from a combination of the approach to equilibrium of the soil waters with depth and more rapid dissolution rates of fresh versus weathered surfaces. At the soil surface, the relative mineral dissolution rate order is found to be quartz>feldspar>mica, with quartz geometric surface area dissolution rates as fast as 2.6 to 4.1\u00d710-13mol/m2/s. As observed in a number of past studies, field based rates obtained in this study are significantly slower than corresponding rates obtained from laboratory studies, suggesting that these latter rates may not accurately describe the reactivity of primary minerals in soils. \u00a9 2014.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Critical zone", "Mineral dissolution kinetics", "Soil production rate (SPR)", "Soil weathering"], "IndexKeywords": ["Approach to equilibrium", "Critical zones", "Field observations", "Geometric surface area", "Laboratory studies", "Mineral dissolution", "Soil production", "Soil weathering", "Dissolution rates", "Granitic soils", "Surface area"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84906699747", "SubjectAreas": [["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"]], "AuthorData": {"7101887457": {"Name": "Parry S.", "AuthorID": "7101887457", "AffiliationID": "60012197", "AffiliationName": "Soil Research Centre, Dept.
