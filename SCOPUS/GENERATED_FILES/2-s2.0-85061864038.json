As a result, age-related changes to the proteins of the ECM have far reaching consequences with the potential to disrupt many different aspects of homeostasis and healthy function. The proteins collagen and elastin are the most abundant in the ECM and their ability to function as a structural support and provide mechanical stability results from the formation of supra-molecular structures. Collagen and elastin have a long half-life, as required by their structural role, which leaves them vulnerable to a range of post-translational modifications. In this chapter the role of the ECM is discussed and the component proteins introduced. Major age-related modifications including glycation, carbamylation and fragmentation and the impact these have on ECM function are reviewed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Advanced glycation end-products", "Ageing", "Collagen", "Elastin", "Fragmentation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Collagen", "Elastin", "Extracellular Matrix", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061864038", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"7005706824": {"Name": "Birch H.", "AuthorID": "7005706824", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL"}}}
