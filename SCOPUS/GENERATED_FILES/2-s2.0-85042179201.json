To address this, we developed a serum-stable, nanoparticle catalyst-labeled LFIA with a sensitivity surpassing that of both current commercial and published sensitivities for paper-based detection of p24, one of the earliest and most conserved biomarkers of HIV. We report the synthesis and characterization of porous platinum core-shell nanocatalysts (PtNCs), which show high catalytic activity when exposed to complex human blood serum samples. We explored the application of antibody-functionalized PtNCs with strategically and orthogonally modified nanobodies with high affinity and specificity toward p24 and established the key larger nanoparticle size regimes needed for efficient amplification and performance in LFIA. Harnessing the catalytic amplification of PtNCs enabled naked-eye detection of p24 spiked into sera in the low femtomolar range (ca. 0.8 pg\u00b7mL-1) and the detection of acute-phase HIV in clinical human plasma samples in under 20 min. This provides a versatile absorbance-based and rapid LFIA with sensitivity capable of significantly reducing the HIV acute phase detection window. This diagnostic may be readily adapted for detection of other biomolecules as an ultrasensitive screening tool for infectious and noncommunicable diseases and can be capitalized upon in PoC settings for early disease detection.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biorthogonal chemistry", "broad dynamic range", "enzyme mimic", "HIV detection", "lateral flow immunoassay", "nanobodies", "point-of-care", "porous platinum core-shell nanoparticles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biorthogonal", "Dynamic range", "Enzyme mimics", "Lateral flow immunoassay", "Nanobodies", "Point of care", "Porous platinum", "Antibodies, Immobilized", "Catalysis", "Equipment Design", "Gold", "HIV", "HIV Core Protein p24", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Immunoassay", "Metal Nanoparticles", "Platinum", "Point-of-Care Testing", "Porosity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042179201", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"55519752300": {"Name": "Loynachan C.N.", "AuthorID": "55519752300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57192977228": {"Name": "Thomas M.R.", "AuthorID": "57192977228", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57200686800": {"Name": "Kim J.", "AuthorID": "57200686800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57194104721": {"Name": "Agarwal S.", "AuthorID": "57194104721", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7402243195": {"Name": "Stevens M.M.", "AuthorID": "7402243195", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "36730986800": {"Name": "Gray E.R.", "AuthorID": "36730986800", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine"}, "57195275473": {"Name": "Miller B.S.", "AuthorID": "57195275473", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine"}, "15821926400": {"Name": "Brookes J.C.", "AuthorID": "15821926400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7006090296": {"Name": "McKendry R.A.", "AuthorID": "7006090296", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology, Division of Medicine"}, "57037847400": {"Name": "Richards D.A.", "AuthorID": "57037847400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24536976100": {"Name": "Chudasama V.", "AuthorID": "24536976100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
