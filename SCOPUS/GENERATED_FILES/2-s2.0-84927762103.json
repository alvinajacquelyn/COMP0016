Recently, ATP1A3 mutations were shown to account for the majority of AHC patients. In addition, a mutation in the SLC2A1 gene was reported in a patient with atypical AHC. We therefore investigated whether mutations in these genes may also be involved in HM. Furthermore, we studied the role of SLC2A1 mutations in a small set of AHC patients without ATP1A3 mutations. Methods: We screened 42 HM patients (21 familial and 21 sporadic patients) for ATP1A3 and SLC2A1 mutations. In addition, four typical AHC patients and one atypical patient with overlapping symptoms of both disorders were screened for SLC2A1 mutations. Results: A pathogenic de novo SLC2A1 mutation (p.Gly18Arg) was found in the atypical patient with overlapping symptoms of AHC and hemiplegic migraine. No mutations were found in the HM and the other AHC patients. Conclusion: Screening for a mutation in the SLC2A1 gene should be considered in patients with a complex phenotype with overlapping symptoms of hemiplegic migraine and AHC.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC)", "Exercise-induced dystonia", "GLUT1 deficiency syndrome", "Hemiplegic migraine (HM)", "SLC2A1 gene"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age of Onset", "Child", "DNA Mutational Analysis", "Female", "Glucose Transporter Type 1", "Hemiplegia", "Humans", "Migraine with Aura", "Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Mutation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927762103", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55665387500": {"Name": "Weller C.M.", "AuthorID": "55665387500", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "57202617120": {"Name": "De Vries B.", "AuthorID": "57202617120", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "55349965800": {"Name": "Geilenkirchen M.A.", "AuthorID": "55349965800", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Leiden University Medical Centre"}, "7003477455": {"Name": "Van Den Maagdenberg A.M.J.M.", "AuthorID": "7003477455", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "15755610200": {"Name": "Leen W.G.", "AuthorID": "15755610200", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.R.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Neurosciences Unit, Institute of Child Health, UCL Medical School"}, "34771020700": {"Name": "Haan J.", "AuthorID": "34771020700", "AffiliationID": "60070236", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Rijnland Hospital"}, "7401893026": {"Name": "Duncan J.S.", "AuthorID": "7401893026", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603436473": {"Name": "Kamsteeg E.J.", "AuthorID": "6603436473", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Institute for Genetic and Metabolic Disease, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "7006534904": {"Name": "Scheffer H.", "AuthorID": "7006534904", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Genetics, Institute for Genetic and Metabolic Disease, Radboud University Medical Centre"}, "55349930200": {"Name": "Ferrari M.D.", "AuthorID": "55349930200", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6603720069": {"Name": "Terwindt G.M.", "AuthorID": "6603720069", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "35953081600": {"Name": "Willemsen M.A.A.P.", "AuthorID": "35953081600", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Medical Centre"}}}
