Herein, the facile bifunctional redox tagging of carbon nanoparticles (diameter 27 nm) and its characterization is undertaken using the industrial dye Reactive Blue 2. The modification route is demonstrated to be via exceptionally strong physisorption. The modified carbon is found to exhibit both well-defined oxidative and reductive voltammetric redox features which are quantitatively interpreted. The method provides a generic approach to monolayer modifications of carbon and carbon nanoparticle surfaces.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Carbon Nano-Particles", "Complex chemistry", "Generic approach", "Modified carbon", "Monolayer modification", "Reactive blues", "Redox features", "Redox moieties"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921793312", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"56494457500": {"Name": "Poon J.", "AuthorID": "56494457500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "11639408100": {"Name": "Batchelor-McAuley C.", "AuthorID": "11639408100", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "28168050500": {"Name": "Tschulik K.", "AuthorID": "28168050500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "55950127500": {"Name": "Compton R.", "AuthorID": "55950127500", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford"}, "8227436900": {"Name": "Palgrave R.", "AuthorID": "8227436900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
