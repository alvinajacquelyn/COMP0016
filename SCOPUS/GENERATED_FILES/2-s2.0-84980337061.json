At present, there is no comprehensive, reliable and valid questionnaire for assessing this capacity and measuring change in response to self-regulation interventions in adults. This paper reports the development of the Self-regulation of Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (SREBQ) for use in UK adults, and presents evidence for its reliability and construct validity. The development of the SREBQ involved generation of an item pool, followed by two pilot studies (Samples 1 and 2) and a test of the questionnaire's underlying factor structure (Sample 3). The final version of the SREBQ was then assessed for reliability and construct validity (Sample 4). Results: Development of the SREBQ resulted in a 5-item questionnaire. The face validity was satisfactory, as assessed by the pilot studies. The factor structure analysis (Sample 3) suggested that it has a single underlying factor, which was confirmed in a second sample (Sample 4). The SREBQ had strong construct validity, showing a positive correlation with general measures of self-regulation. It was also positively correlated with motivation and behavioural automaticity, and negatively correlated with food responsiveness and emotional over-eating (p < 0.001). It showed good discriminant validity, as it was only weakly associated with satiety responsiveness, food fussiness and slowness in eating. Conclusions: The SREBQ is a reliable and valid measure for assessment of eating self-regulatory capacity in the general UK adult population.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Eating behaviour", "Measurement", "Questionnaire", "Reliability", "Self-control", "Self-regulation", "Validity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Body Weight", "Diet", "Eating", "Emotions", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Humans", "Hyperphagia", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Pilot Projects", "Psychometrics", "Reproducibility of Results", "Self-Control", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84980337061", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"], ["Nutrition and Dietetics", "NURS", "2916"]], "AuthorData": {"55543645200": {"Name": "Kliemann N.", "AuthorID": "55543645200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "36196242700": {"Name": "Beeken R.", "AuthorID": "36196242700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "7102146930": {"Name": "Wardle J.", "AuthorID": "7102146930", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}, "7401522015": {"Name": "Johnson F.", "AuthorID": "7401522015", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}}}
