Current research is focused on the evaluation of amide proton transfer (APT) chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MR imaging for brain tumour imaging. In this hybrid MR-PET study, brain tumours were compared using 3D data derived from APT-CEST MRI and amino acid PET using O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET). Methods: Eight patients with gliomas were investigated simultaneously with 18F-FET PET and APT-CEST MRI using a 3-T MR-BrainPET scanner. CEST imaging was based on a steady-state approach using a B1 average power of 1\u03bcT. B0 field inhomogeneities were corrected a Prametric images of magnetisation transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) and differences to the extrapolated semi-solid magnetisation transfer reference method, APT# and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE#), were calculated. Statistical analysis of the tumour-to-brain ratio of the CEST data was performed against PET data using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test. Results: A tumour-to-brain ratio derived from APT# and 18F-FET presented no significant differences, and no correlation was found between APT# and 18F-FET PET data. The distance between local hot spot APT# and 18F-FET were different (average 20 \u00b1 13 mm, range 4\u201345 mm). Conclusion: For the first time, CEST images were compared with 18F-FET in a simultaneous MR-PET measurement. Imaging findings derived from18F-FET PET and APT CEST MRI seem to provide different biological information. The validation of these imaging findings by histological confirmation is necessary, ideally using stereotactic biopsy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["18F-FET PET", "APT", "CEST", "Glioma", "Hybrid MR-PET"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Brain Neoplasms", "Female", "Glioma", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", "Protons", "Tyrosine", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042443322", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"55348928500": {"Name": "da Silva N.A.", "AuthorID": "55348928500", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "55359170000": {"Name": "Lohmann P.", "AuthorID": "55359170000", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "48662194200": {"Name": "Magill A.W.", "AuthorID": "48662194200", "AffiliationID": "60017059", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics in Radiology, German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ)"}, "6603263568": {"Name": "Oros Peusquens A.M.", "AuthorID": "6603263568", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "35519420000": {"Name": "Choi C.H.", "AuthorID": "35519420000", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "56020979300": {"Name": "Stirnberg R.", "AuthorID": "56020979300", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)"}, "11440988400": {"Name": "Stoffels G.", "AuthorID": "11440988400", "AffiliationID": "60007774", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine, Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich GmbH"}, "8057355400": {"Name": "Galldiks N.", "AuthorID": "8057355400", "AffiliationID": "60121290, 60024025", "AffiliationName": "Center of Integrated Oncology (CIO), Universities of Cologne and Bonn"}, "24383825000": {"Name": "Langen K.J.", "AuthorID": "24383825000", "AffiliationID": "60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, RWTH University of Aachen"}, "8508072500": {"Name": "Jon Shah N.", "AuthorID": "8508072500", "AffiliationID": "60120200, 60016653", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University"}, "57200695347": {"Name": "Fairney J.", "AuthorID": "57200695347", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
