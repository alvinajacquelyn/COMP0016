Almost 70% of assaults occur in the mental health sector, and although serious, non-fatal injury is rare, the individual and economic impact can be substantial. In the present study, we analysed mandatory incident reports from a national database to examine whether there were identifiable precursors to incidents leading to staff injury, and whether staff characteristics were associated with injury. In line with previous descriptions, we found injury occurred either as a direct result of patient assault or during physical interventions employed by staff to contain aggression. Importantly, we found little evidence from staff reports that patients' symptoms were driving aggression, and we found less evidence of patient perspectives among reports. We make several recommendations regarding the reporting of these events that could inform policy and interventions aimed at minimizing the likelihood of injury.", "AuthorKeywords": ["aggression", "inpatient", "staff injury", "violence"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Hospitals, Psychiatric", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Occupational Injuries", "Restraint, Physical", "United Kingdom", "Violence", "Workplace", "Wounds and Injuries", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85028249765", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"]], "AuthorData": {"23571242000": {"Name": "Renwick L.", "AuthorID": "23571242000", "AffiliationID": "119124336", "AffiliationName": null}, "37020648100": {"Name": "Price O.", "AuthorID": "37020648100", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": null}, "55804303900": {"Name": "Williams H.", "AuthorID": "55804303900", "AffiliationID": "60028884", "AffiliationName": null}, "7102732657": {"Name": "Bowers L.", "AuthorID": "7102732657", "AffiliationID": "119124336", "AffiliationName": null}, "55786464300": {"Name": "Lavelle M.", "AuthorID": "55786464300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": null}, "56723670200": {"Name": "Brennan G.", "AuthorID": "56723670200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "16640434900": {"Name": "Stewart D.", "AuthorID": "16640434900", "AffiliationID": "60004814", "AffiliationName": null}, "22985170000": {"Name": "James K.", "AuthorID": "22985170000", "AffiliationID": "60117587", "AffiliationName": null}, "36053555200": {"Name": "Richardson M.", "AuthorID": "36053555200", "AffiliationID": "60006242, 60022148", "AffiliationName": null}}}
