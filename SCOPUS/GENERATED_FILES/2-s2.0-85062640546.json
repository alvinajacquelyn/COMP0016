Molecular genetics has identified 7 clades of VZV (1-6 and 9), with 2 more mooted. Differences between the vOka vaccine strain and wild-type VZVs have been used to distinguish the cause of postimmunization events and to provide insight into the natural history of VZV infections. Importantly molecular genetics has shown that reinfection with establishment of latency by the reinfecting strain is common, that dual infections with different viruses can occur, and that reactivation of the superinfecting genotype can both occur. Whole-genome sequencing of the vOka vaccine has been used to show that vesicles form from a single virion, that latency is established within a few days of inoculation, and that all vaccine strains are capable of establishing latency and reactivating. Novel molecular tools have characterized the transcripts expressed during latent infection in vitro.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Genotype", "Herpesvirus 3, Human", "Humans", "Molecular Epidemiology", "Varicella Zoster Virus Infection", "Virus Activation", "Virus Latency"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062640546", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"55498702100": {"Name": "Breuer J.", "AuthorID": "55498702100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}}}
