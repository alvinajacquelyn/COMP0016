All rights reserved.The research presented here outlines an application of Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) used to support strategic decision-making in the emergency services. Here the resulting ABM-driven Decision Support System (DSS) (called 'Premonition') is designed to help practitioners engage with a complex and dynamic environment of co-evolving fire risk behaviours through time. Social change is presented here as a process by which behaviours co-evolve within connected networks of agents. ABM is identified as a beneficial approach to simulate changing household behaviours and the influence of social networks, environmental factors, and also fire service interventions within the Sheffield City region, UK. This project seeks to develop a DSS which supports the stages of 'intelligence', 'design', and 'choice' as the decision-maker moves from identifying problem areas, establishing possible strategies for intervention, and predicting possible outcomes of alternative courses of action.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agent-based model", "Co-evolution", "Connectivity", "Decision support system", "Domestic fire risk behaviour"], "IndexKeywords": ["Agent-based model", "Agent-based modelling", "Co-evolution", "Connectivity", "Decision support system (dss)", "Environmental factors", "Fire risks", "Strategic decision making"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979570921", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"51664794000": {"Name": "Dobson S.", "AuthorID": "51664794000", "AffiliationID": "60017326", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Transformational Entrepreneurship, Coventry University"}, "36987854900": {"Name": "Burkitt M.", "AuthorID": "36987854900", "AffiliationID": "60001881", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, University of Sheffield"}, "25644027900": {"Name": "Breslin D.", "AuthorID": "25644027900", "AffiliationID": "60116262", "AffiliationName": "Management School, University of Sheffield"}, "23390339500": {"Name": "Romano D.", "AuthorID": "23390339500", "AffiliationID": "60022506, 60117772", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computing, Edge Hill University"}}}
