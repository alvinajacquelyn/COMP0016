We show that in high-z QSO environments both the central QSO and the surrounding galaxies concertedly control the reionization morphology of hydrogen and helium and have a non-linear impact on the thermal structure of the IGM. A QSO imprints a distinctive morphology on HII regions if its total ionizing photon budget exceeds that of the surrounding galaxies since the onset of hydrogen reionization; otherwise, the morphology shows little difference from that of HII regions produced only by galaxies. In addition, the spectral shape of the collective radiation field from galaxies and QSOs controls the thickness of the I-fronts. While a UV-obscured QSO can broaden the I-front, the contribution from other UV sources, either galaxies or unobscured QSOs, is sufficient to maintain a sharp I-front. X-ray photons from the QSO are responsible for a prominent extended tail of partial ionization ahead of the I-front. QSOs leave a unique imprint on the morphology of He II/He III regions. We suggest that, while the physical state of the IGM is modified by QSOs, the most direct test to understand the role of galaxies and QSOs during reionization is to perform galaxy surveys in a region of sky imaged by 21 cm tomography.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark ages", "First stars", "Intergalactic medium", "Methods: numerical", "Radiative transfer", "Reionization"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85023778845", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55413049700": {"Name": "Kakiichi K.", "AuthorID": "55413049700", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "36160330800": {"Name": "Graziani L.", "AuthorID": "36160330800", "AffiliationID": "60024986", "AffiliationName": "INAF Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma"}, "6603692623": {"Name": "Ciardi B.", "AuthorID": "6603692623", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "55888628500": {"Name": "Compostella M.", "AuthorID": "55888628500", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "57201658046": {"Name": "Eide M.B.", "AuthorID": "57201658046", "AffiliationID": "60023091", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics"}, "55966310700": {"Name": "Meiksin A.", "AuthorID": "55966310700", "AffiliationID": "60110880, 60027272", "AffiliationName": "SUPA, Institute for Astronomy, University of Edinburgh"}, "7003603348": {"Name": "Zaroubi S.", "AuthorID": "7003603348", "AffiliationID": "60011173, 60010023", "AffiliationName": "Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen"}}}
