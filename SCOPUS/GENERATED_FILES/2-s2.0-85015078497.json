Design Data were from 2423 men and 3057 women aged \u226550 years participating in Wave 5 (2010/11) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Participants reported experiences of weight discrimination in everyday life and frequency of light, moderate and vigorous physical activities. We used logistic regression to test associations between perceived weight discrimination and physical activity, controlling for age, sex, socioeconomic status and body mass index (BMI). Results Perceived weight discrimination was associated with almost 60% higher odds of being inactive (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.40, p=.028) and 30% lower odds of engaging in moderate or vigorous activity at least once a week (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.94, p=.017). Conclusions Independent of BMI, individuals who perceive unfair treatment on the basis of their weight are less physically active than those who do not perceive discrimination. This has important implications for the health and well-being of individuals who experience weight-based discrimination, and may also contribute to a cycle of weight gain and further mistreatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["physical activity", "population studies", "stigma", "Weight-Related discrimination"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aging", "Attitude to Health", "Body Weight", "England", "Exercise", "Female", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Self Concept", "Social Class", "Social Discrimination"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015078497", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57196323380": {"Name": "Jackson S.", "AuthorID": "57196323380", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "7102289942": {"Name": "Steptoe A.", "AuthorID": "7102289942", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
