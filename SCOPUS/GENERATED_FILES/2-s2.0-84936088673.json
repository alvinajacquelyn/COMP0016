Absence of ligands providing either signal 1 or 2 provides NK resistance. We manufactured a lysate of a tumour cell line which provides signal 1 to resting NK cells without signal 2. The tumor-primed NK cells (TpNK) lyse NK resistant Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) blasts expressing signal 2 ligands. We conducted a clinical trial to determine the toxicity of TpNK cell infusions from haploidentical donors. 15 patients with high risk AML were screened, 13 enrolled and 7 patients treated. The remaining 6 either failed to respond to re-induction chemotherapy or the donor refused to undergo peripheral blood apheresis. The conditioning consisted of fludarabine and total body irradiation. This was the first UK trial of a cell therapy regulated as a medicine. The complexity of Good Clinical Practice compliance was underestimated and led to failures requiring retrospective independent data review. The lessons learned are an important aspect of this report. There was no evidence of infusional toxicity. Profound myelosuppression was seen in the majority (median neutrophil recovery day 55). At six months follow-up, three patients treated in Complete Remission (CR) remained in remission, one patient infused in Partial Remission had achieved CR1, two had relapsed and one had died. One year post-treatment one patient remained in CR. Four patients remained in CR after treatment for longer than their most recent previous CR. During the 2 year follow-up six of seven patients died; median overall survival was 400 days post infusion (range 141-910). This is the first clinical trial of an NK therapy in the absence of IL-2 or other cytokine support. The HLA-mismatched NK cells survived and expanded in vivo without on-going host immunosuppression and appeared to exert an anti-leukemia effect in 4/7 patients treated.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Cell Transplantation", "Female", "Humans", "Killer Cells, Natural", "Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Monitoring, Physiologic", "Transplantation Conditioning", "Transplantation, Homologous", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936088673", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"6701389817": {"Name": "Kottaridis P.D.", "AuthorID": "6701389817", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "7103048234": {"Name": "North J.", "AuthorID": "7103048234", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "54584544300": {"Name": "Tsirogianni M.", "AuthorID": "54584544300", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "57217980571": {"Name": "Marden C.", "AuthorID": "57217980571", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "34973630700": {"Name": "Samuel E.R.", "AuthorID": "34973630700", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "52263779200": {"Name": "Jide-Banwo S.", "AuthorID": "52263779200", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "7006091031": {"Name": "Grace S.", "AuthorID": "7006091031", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}, "7003930276": {"Name": "Lowdell M.W.", "AuthorID": "7003930276", "AffiliationID": "60029950, 60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, UCL Medical School"}}}
