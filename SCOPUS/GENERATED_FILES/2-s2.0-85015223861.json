Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.This paper deals with the problem of assessing probabilistic models that represent the evolution of a target graph. Such models have long been a topic of interest for a number of networks, especially communications networks. The solution developed in this paper gives a rigorous way to calculate the likelihood of the observed graph evolution having arisen from a wide variety of hypothesized models encompassing many already present in the literature. The framework is shown to recover parameters from artificial data and is tested on real data sets from Facebook and from emails from the company Enron.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dynamic networks", "Network evolution", "Network likelihood"], "IndexKeywords": ["Artificial data", "Communications networks", "Dynamic network", "Facebook", "Network evolution", "Probabilistic models", "Real data sets"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015223861", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Management Science and Operations Research", "DECI", "1803"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"], ["Computational Mathematics", "MATH", "2605"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56186242800": {"Name": "Clegg R.", "AuthorID": "56186242800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College"}, "26641923800": {"Name": "Parker B.", "AuthorID": "26641923800", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Southampton University"}, "15124049200": {"Name": "Rio M.", "AuthorID": "15124049200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
