In situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is capable of monitoring the change of metal ion valences and formation of active sites during redox reactions, allowing for the identification of ongoing redox pathways. Here in situ EPR spectroscopy combined with online gas analysis, supported by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), temporal analysis of product (TAP), and mass spectrometry (MS) studies, was utilized to study the redox behavior of CuO-CeO2 catalysts under PROX conditions (preferential oxidation of carbon monoxide in hydrogen). Two redox mechanisms are revealed: (i) a synergetic mechanism that involves the redox pair Ce4+/Ce3+ during oxidation of Cu0/Cu+ species to Cu2+ and (ii) a direct mechanism that bypasses the redox pair Ce4+/Ce3+. In addition, EPR experiments with isotopically enriched 17O2 established the synergetic mechanism as the major redox reaction pathway. The results emphasize the importance of the interactions between Cu and Ce atoms for catalyst performance. With the guidance of these results, an optimized CuO-CeO2 catalyst could be designed. A rather wide temperature operation window of 11 K (from 377 to 388 K), with 99% conversion efficiency and 99% selectivity, was achieved for the preferential oxidation of CO in a H2 feed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CuO-CeO2 catalyst", "EPR", "in situ spectroscopy", "preferential CO oxidation", "redox mechanism"], "IndexKeywords": ["CuO-CeO", "Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy", "In-situ spectroscopy", "Preferential CO oxidation", "Preferential oxidation of carbon monoxides", "Redox mechanism", "Temporal analysis of product", "X-ray absorption near-edge structure"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84973644330", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"57196463946": {"Name": "Wang F.", "AuthorID": "57196463946", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Materials and Catalysis Laboratory, Department of Chemical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006419362": {"Name": "Sch\u00fcth F.", "AuthorID": "7006419362", "AffiliationID": "60018135", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung"}, "23993594800": {"Name": "B\u00fcchel R.", "AuthorID": "23993594800", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "7103264156": {"Name": "Pratsinis S.", "AuthorID": "7103264156", "AffiliationID": "60025858", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering, ETH Z\u00fcrich"}, "7006929876": {"Name": "Savitsky A.", "AuthorID": "7006929876", "AffiliationID": "60072285", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Chemische Energiekonversion"}, "8621556700": {"Name": "Zalibera M.", "AuthorID": "8621556700", "AffiliationID": "60006861", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry and Chemical Physics, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology"}, "7102659552": {"Name": "Lubitz W.", "AuthorID": "7102659552", "AffiliationID": "60072285", "AffiliationName": "Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Chemische Energiekonversion"}, "22037183600": {"Name": "Widmann D.", "AuthorID": "22037183600", "AffiliationID": "60010586", "AffiliationName": "Ulm University, Institute of Surface Chemistry and Catalysis"}}}
