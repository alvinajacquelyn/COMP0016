Methods: A series of in vitro experiments were undertaken to establish the feasibility of iohexol reverse iontophoresis and to determine the optimal conditions for the approach. Subsequently, a pilot study in paediatric patients was performed to provide proof-of-concept. Results: The iontophoretic extraction fluxes of iohexol in vitro were proportional to the marker subdermal concentration and the reverse iontophoretic technique was able to track changes dynamically in simulated pharmacokinetic profiles. Reverse iontophoresis sampling was well tolerated by the four paediatric participants. The deduced values of the iohexol terminal elimination rate constant from transdermal reverse iontophoresis sampling agreed with those estimated by conventional blood sampling. Conclusions: Reverse iontophoretic transdermal extraction fluxes mirrored the subdermal concentration profiles of iohexol, a relatively large neutral marker of glomerular filtration both in vitro and in vivo. The efficiency of extraction in vivo was well predicted by the in vitro model used.", "AuthorKeywords": ["GFR", "Iohexol", "Iontophoresis", "Non-invasive monitoring", "Transdermal sampling"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Cutaneous", "Adolescent", "Animals", "Child", "Female", "Glomerular Filtration Rate", "Humans", "Iohexol", "Iontophoresis", "Male", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Pilot Projects", "Skin Absorption", "Swine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921491415", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55110484300": {"Name": "Djabri A.", "AuthorID": "55110484300", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "7201580157": {"Name": "Guy R.H.", "AuthorID": "7201580157", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "7003434711": {"Name": "Delgado-Charro M.B.", "AuthorID": "7003434711", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath"}, "7004098195": {"Name": "Van'T Hoff W.", "AuthorID": "7004098195", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7005783608": {"Name": "Brock P.", "AuthorID": "7005783608", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "7102513915": {"Name": "Wong I.C.K.", "AuthorID": "7102513915", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Safe Medication Practice and Research, Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy, University of Hong Kong"}}}
