All rights reserved.Recent studies show that apoptosis affects surrounding tissue, playing a role in diseases such as fibrosis, a significant global disease burden. Elucidating the mechanisms by which the different apoptotic cells present during fibrotic wound healing affect their environment would enable development of new therapies. We describe here a simple, rapid, and cost-effective method for inducing apoptosis of primary normal human dermal fibroblasts without affecting the overall cell viability of the population. Such population could be used for in vitro models of fibrotic wound healing in co-culture with other cells involved in this process to study events such as apoptosis-induced proliferation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Apoptosis", "Cell viability", "Ethanol", "Fibrosis", "Primary normal human dermal fibroblasts"], "IndexKeywords": ["Apoptotic cells", "Cell viability", "Cost-effective methods", "Disease burdens", "Fibrosis", "In-vitro models", "Normal human dermal fibroblasts", "Wound healing", "Apoptosis", "Cell Proliferation", "Cost-Benefit Analysis", "Cytological Techniques", "Fibroblasts", "Fibrosis", "Humans", "Skin", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84913586130", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"55375422500": {"Name": "Garc\u00eda-Gareta E.", "AuthorID": "55375422500", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "RAFT Institute of Plastic Surgery, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "57217801277": {"Name": "Ravindran N.", "AuthorID": "57217801277", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "RAFT Institute of Plastic Surgery, Mount Vernon Hospital"}, "57214486916": {"Name": "Dye J.F.", "AuthorID": "57214486916", "AffiliationID": "60006776", "AffiliationName": "RAFT Institute of Plastic Surgery, Mount Vernon Hospital"}}}
