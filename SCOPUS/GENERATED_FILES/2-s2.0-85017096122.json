It has been suggested that the distinct regional distribution profile of tau pathology in AD may be a consequence of the intrinsic network structure of the human brain. The spatially distributed brain regions that are most affected by the spread of tau pathology may hence reflect an interconnected neuronal system. Here, we characterized the brain-wide regional distribution profile of tau pathology in AD using 18F-AV 1451 tau-sensitive positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and studied this pattern in relation to the functional network organization of the human brain. Specifically, we quantified the spatial correspondence of the regional distribution pattern of PET-evidenced tau pathology in AD with functional brain networks characterized by large-scale resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data in healthy subjects. Regional distribution patterns of increased PET-evidenced tau pathology in AD compared to controls were characterized in two independent samples of prodromal and manifest AD cases (the Swedish BioFINDER study, n = 44; the ADNI study, n = 35). In the BioFINDER study we found that the typical AD tau pattern involved predominantly inferior, medial, and lateral temporal cortical areas, as well as the precuneus/posterior cingulate, and lateral parts of the parietal and occipital cortex. This pattern overlapped primarily with the dorsal attention, and to some extent with higher visual, limbic and parts of the default-mode network. PET-evidenced tau pathology in the ADNI replication sample, which represented a more prodromal group of AD cases, was less pronounced but showed a highly similar spatial distribution profile, suggesting an earlier-stage snapshot of a consistently progressing regional pattern. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the regional deposition of tau aggregates in AD predominantly affects higher-order cognitive over primary sensory-motor networks, but does not appear to be specific for the default-mode or related limbic networks.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Functional brain networks", "Positron emission tomography", "Tau"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017096122", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7006190615": {"Name": "Hansson O.", "AuthorID": "7006190615", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Memory Clinic, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "57193846395": {"Name": "Strandberg T.", "AuthorID": "57193846395", "AffiliationID": "60029170", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Memory Research Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, Lund University"}, "9233528000": {"Name": "Smith R.", "AuthorID": "9233528000", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "35070295800": {"Name": "Sch\u00f6ll M.", "AuthorID": "35070295800", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "MedTech West and the Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, University of Gothenburg"}, "36174929100": {"Name": "Grothe M.", "AuthorID": "36174929100", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "35588643800": {"Name": "Ohlsson T.", "AuthorID": "35588643800", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiation Physics, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "35332200300": {"Name": "H\u00e4gerstr\u00f6m D.", "AuthorID": "35332200300", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "25632316100": {"Name": "J\u00f6gi J.", "AuthorID": "25632316100", "AffiliationID": "60014077", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Physiology and Nuclear Medicine, Sk\u00e5ne University Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
