However, the physico-chemical mechanisms underpinning this approach are still poorly known. In the present study, we theoretically determine the equilibrium isotopic fractionation properties of structural boron species in calcium carbonates, BO33\u2212, BO2(OH)2\u2212 and B(OH)4\u2212 anions substituted for carbonate groups, as well as those of B(OH)4\u2212 and B(OH)3 species in vacuum. Significant variability of equilibrium isotopic fractionation properties is observed among these structural species which is related to their contrasted coordination state, B\u2013O bond lengths and atomic-scale environment. The isotopic composition of structural boron does not only depend on its coordination number but also on its medium range environment, i.e. farther than its first coordination shell. The isotopic fractionation between aqueous species and their counterparts in vacuum are assessed using previous investigations based on similar quantum-mechanical modeling approaches. At 300 K, the equilibrium isotope composition of structural trigonal species is 7\u201315\u2030 lighter than that of aqueous boric acid molecules, whereas substituted tetrahedral borate ions are heavier than their aqueous counterparts by 10\u201313\u2030. Although significant uncertainties are known to affect the theoretical prediction of fractionation factors between solids and solutions, the usually assumed lack of isotopic fractionation during borate incorporation in carbonates is challenged by these theoretical results. The present theoretical equilibrium fractionation factors between structural boron and aqueous species differ from those inferred from experiments which may indicate that isotopic equilibrium, unlike chemical equilibrium, was not reached in most experiments. Further research into the isotopic fractionation processes at the interface between calcium carbonates and aqueous solution as well as long duration experiments aimed at investigating the kinetics of equilibration of boron environment and isotopic composition are therefore required to refine our understanding of boron coprecipitation in carbonates and thus the theory behind the use of boron isotopes as an ocean pH proxy.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ab initio modeling", "Boron pH-proxy", "Calcium carbonates", "Theoretical isotopic fractionation factors"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032888201", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"7006375157": {"Name": "Balan E.", "AuthorID": "7006375157", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60028993, 60028311, 60157961", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s \u2013 Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie, de Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie (IMPMC), UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 6, UMR CNRS 7590, UMR IRD 206, MNHN"}, "56070111800": {"Name": "Pietrucci F.", "AuthorID": "56070111800", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60028993, 60028311, 60157961", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s \u2013 Institut de Min\u00e9ralogie, de Physique des Mat\u00e9riaux et de Cosmochimie (IMPMC), UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 6, UMR CNRS 7590, UMR IRD 206, MNHN"}, "56317139800": {"Name": "Noireaux J.", "AuthorID": "56317139800", "AffiliationID": "60001970, 60123796, 60008134", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9, Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot, CNRS"}, "6602183200": {"Name": "Gaillardet J.", "AuthorID": "6602183200", "AffiliationID": "60029631", "AffiliationName": "Institut Universitaire de France"}, "45761422700": {"Name": "Mavromatis V.", "AuthorID": "45761422700", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60104363, 60025468", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse, Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "6507453027": {"Name": "Saldi G.D.", "AuthorID": "6507453027", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60104363, 60025468", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse, Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "10440413800": {"Name": "Blanchard M.", "AuthorID": "10440413800", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60104363, 60025468", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse, Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "7103177603": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177603", "AffiliationID": "60102124, 60104363, 60025468", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9osciences Environnement Toulouse, Observatoire Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, CNRS-Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse"}, "6603723558": {"Name": "Montouillout V.", "AuthorID": "6603723558", "AffiliationID": "60029689", "AffiliationName": "CEMHTI CNRS UPR3079, Universit\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans"}, "7005326651": {"Name": "Gervais C.", "AuthorID": "7005326651", "AffiliationID": "60001422, 60158061", "AffiliationName": "Sorbonne Universit\u00e9s \u2013 Laboratoire de Chimie de la Mati\u00e8re Condens\u00e9e de Paris (LCMCP), UPMC Universit\u00e9 Paris 6, UMR CNRS 7574"}, "7004200539": {"Name": "Rustad J.R.", "AuthorID": "7004200539", "AffiliationID": "60027757", "AffiliationName": "Office of Basic Energy Sciences, SC-22.1/Germantown Building, U.S. Department of Energy"}}}
