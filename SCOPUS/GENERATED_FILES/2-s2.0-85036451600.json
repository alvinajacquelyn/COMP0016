The International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Recent studies have suggested that the use of robotic surgery for prostatectomy has been increasing, but characterization of the diffusion of robotic surgery in other procedures has not been available. Methods: Data were analysed for the years 2006\u20132014 using hospital episode statistics (HES), a database of all admissions to National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in England. OPCS codes were used to determine the annual number of prostatectomy, partial nephrectomy, and total abdominal hysterectomy procedures. Concurrent OPCS codes were then used to identify whether these procedures were robotic, conventional laparoscopic or open surgery. Results: The proportion of robotic cases varied depending on the surgical procedure. Diffusion of robotic surgery was relatively rapid in prostatectomy, moderate in partial nephrectomy, and slow in total abdominal hysterectomy. Conclusions: Although high institutional cost might explain the earliest delays in diffusion, this barrier does not fully account for the different rates of diffusion among surgical procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Diffusion of Innovation", "England", "Female", "Humans", "Hysterectomy", "Male", "National Health Programs", "Nephrectomy", "Prostatectomy", "Regression Analysis", "Retrospective Studies", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Robotics", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036451600", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"16643089500": {"Name": "Marcus H.J.", "AuthorID": "16643089500", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "55694086700": {"Name": "Hughes-Hallett A.", "AuthorID": "55694086700", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "36622128200": {"Name": "Payne C.J.", "AuthorID": "36622128200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "55642413300": {"Name": "Cundy T.P.", "AuthorID": "55642413300", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "55539304100": {"Name": "Yang G.Z.", "AuthorID": "55539304100", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "14633357600": {"Name": "Darzi A.", "AuthorID": "14633357600", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "The Hamlyn Centre, Institute of Global Health Innovation, Imperial College London"}, "7005763096": {"Name": "Nandi D.", "AuthorID": "7005763096", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}}}
