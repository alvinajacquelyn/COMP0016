Even though colonoscopy is considered the most effective method for screening and diagnosis, the success of the procedure is highly dependent on the operator skills and level of hand-eye coordination. In this work, we propose to adapt fully convolution neural networks (FCN), to identify and segment polyps in colonoscopy images. We converted three established networks into a fully convolution architecture and fine-tuned their learned representations to the polyp segmentation task. We validate our framework on the 2015 MICCAI polyp detection challenge dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art in automated polyp detection. Our method obtained high segmentation accuracy and a detection precision and recall of 73.61% and 86.31%, respectively.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Colorectal cancers (CRC)", "Convolution neural network", "Convolutional neural network", "Detection precision", "Established networks", "Hand eye coordination", "Polyp segmentation", "Segmentation accuracy"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020289695", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"57194468794": {"Name": "Brandao P.", "AuthorID": "57194468794", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35097627900": {"Name": "Mazomenos E.", "AuthorID": "35097627900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35098386200": {"Name": "Ciuti G.", "AuthorID": "35098386200", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "BioRobotics Institute, Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "56073871800": {"Name": "Cali\u00f2 R.", "AuthorID": "56073871800", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "BioRobotics Institute, Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "57189889091": {"Name": "Bianchi F.", "AuthorID": "57189889091", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "BioRobotics Institute, Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "7004244810": {"Name": "Menciassi A.", "AuthorID": "7004244810", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "BioRobotics Institute, Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "36040468400": {"Name": "Dario P.", "AuthorID": "36040468400", "AffiliationID": "60028039", "AffiliationName": "BioRobotics Institute, Scuola Superiore sant'Anna"}, "14627591700": {"Name": "Koulaouzidis A.", "AuthorID": "14627591700", "AffiliationID": "60002975", "AffiliationName": "Endoscopy Unit, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh"}, "6701795382": {"Name": "Arezzo A.", "AuthorID": "6701795382", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgical Sciences, University of Turin"}}}
