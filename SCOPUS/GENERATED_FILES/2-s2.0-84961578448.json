Many real-world applications present this labelling structure and that has increased the number of methods and algorithms developed over the last years in this field. Although ordinal regression can be faced using standard nominal classification techniques, there are several algorithms which can specifically benefit from the ordering information. Therefore, this paper is aimed at reviewing the state of the art on these techniques and proposing a taxonomy based on how the models are constructed to take the order into account. Furthermore, a thorough experimental study is proposed to check if the use of the order information improves the performance of the models obtained, considering some of the approaches within the taxonomy. The results confirm that ordering information benefits ordinal models improving their accuracy and the closeness of the predictions to actual targets in the ordinal scale.", "AuthorKeywords": ["artificial neural networks", "augmented binary classification", "binary decomposition", "discriminant learning", "ordinal classification", "Ordinal regression", "proportional odds model", "support vector machines", "threshold methods"], "IndexKeywords": ["Augmented binaries", "Binary decompositions", "discriminant learning", "Ordinal classification", "Ordinal regression", "Proportional odds model", "Threshold methods"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961578448", "SubjectAreas": [["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Computational Theory and Mathematics", "COMP", "1703"]], "AuthorData": {"23473354200": {"Name": "Guti\u00e9rrez P.A.", "AuthorID": "23473354200", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "57217862239": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Monedero J.", "AuthorID": "57217862239", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "6603240334": {"Name": "Herv\u00e1s-Mart\u00ednez C.", "AuthorID": "6603240334", "AffiliationID": "60003138", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science and Numerical Analysis, University of C\u00f3rdoba"}, "35068542300": {"Name": "P\u00e9rez-Ortiz M.", "AuthorID": "35068542300", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Engineering, Loyola University Andaluc\u00eda"}, "35208362300": {"Name": "Fern\u00e1ndez-Navarro F.", "AuthorID": "35208362300", "AffiliationID": "60086940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics and Engineering, Loyola University Andaluc\u00eda"}}}
