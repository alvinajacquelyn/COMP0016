Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdBackground: Only a handful of studies have assessed tooth loss risk in chronic periodontitis patients following active therapy and factors associated with it. Aims: The aim of this retrospective study was to assess tooth loss in a cohort of chronic periodontitis patients undergoing maintenance care in a UK private practice setting. Materials and Methods: One hundred chronic periodontitis patients treated with active periodontal therapy were followed up in supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) for at least 5 years. Tooth loss rates and the effect of patient and tooth factors on tooth loss were assessed. Existing patient-based prognosis systems and a novel tooth-based prognosis system were tested for their association with tooth loss. Results: Excluding third molars, 34 teeth were extracted during SPT, with an overall average tooth loss of 0.06 teeth/patient/year (0.02 for periodontal reasons). Multivariable analysis showed that age, patient prognosis based on the Periodontal Risk Assessment system, tooth prognosis, furcation involvement and previous endodontic therapy were significantly associated with tooth loss during SPT. Conclusion: Good overall stability and a small tooth loss rate were observed in this cohort of chronic periodontitis cases under SPT in private practice. Patient-based and tooth-based prognosis systems may be used to estimate the risk of tooth loss.", "AuthorKeywords": ["maintenance", "periodontitis", "progression", "stability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic Periodontitis", "Disease Progression", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Private Practice", "Retrospective Studies", "Tooth Loss", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007470975", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"22835642700": {"Name": "Nibali L.", "AuthorID": "22835642700", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "55330279000": {"Name": "Akcal\u0131 A.", "AuthorID": "55330279000", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Oral Clinical Research, Institute of Dentistry, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University London (QMUL)"}, "57191727502": {"Name": "Sun C.", "AuthorID": "57191727502", "AffiliationID": "106430966", "AffiliationName": "Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Suzhou Health College"}, "57192694565": {"Name": "Meng X.", "AuthorID": "57192694565", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"}, "7201525590": {"Name": "Tu Y.", "AuthorID": "7201525590", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"}}}
