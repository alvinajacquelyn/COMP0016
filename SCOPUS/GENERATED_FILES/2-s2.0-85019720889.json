A first introductory section proposes a normative framework for this inquiry, arguing for a more inclusive approach to relational scope where collective labour rights are engaged and finding a basis for this approach in ILO Recommendation No 198. A second section demonstrates the way in which the relevant jurisprudence of UK labour/employment law has seemed to be out of accord with that normative approach. A third section demonstrates how the case law of the ECJ and CJEU has also in its own way been unsympathetic to claims that selfemployed workers should be brought within the fold of collective labour law, particularly with regard to collective bargaining. A fourth section further develops a supranational perspective upon these arguments, concentrating on arguments and pronouncements emanating from the European Committee for Social Rights. A fifth section considers ways in which novel scenarios of differentiation between 'labour' and 'capital' are presenting themselves in the context of the so-called 'gig economy', focusing on the very recent UK Employment Tribunal decision in the Uber case. A sixth concluding section expresses the hope that the article has opened up a largely untrodden path towards an authentically collective view of the debate about the personal scope of labour/employment law.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85019720889", "SubjectAreas": [["Law", "SOCI", "3308"]], "AuthorData": {"6506058637": {"Name": "Freedland M.", "AuthorID": "6506058637", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "University of Oxford"}, "23976268800": {"Name": "Kountouris N.", "AuthorID": "23976268800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
