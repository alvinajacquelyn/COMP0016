All rights reserved.This chapter highlights challenges facing conservation of the most threatened antelopes by focusing on the situation in the Sahara desert and the bordering Sahelian grasslands. Sahelo-Saharan ungulates are uniquely adapted, physiologically, morphologically, and behaviourally, to deal with the ecology and climate of the region. The chapter provides a broad overview of the current conservation status and distribution of the gazelles and larger antelopes in the region. The dorcas gazelle is also the most versatile of the group, inhabiting not only the typical grasslands of the Sahel and sub-desert but also open desert and mountain systems where suitable habitat occurs. The chapter presents the threats they face, and discusses options for their conservation and future valorization. The conservation of Sahelo-Saharan gazelles and antelopes has been consistently beggared by a lack of resources and interest on the part of the international conservation community.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Desert antelopes", "Dorcas gazelle", "Habitat", "International conservation community", "Mountain systems", "Sahara desert", "Sahelo-Saharan gazelles"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84984670492", "SubjectAreas": [["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"7006140222": {"Name": "Newby J.", "AuthorID": "7006140222", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Sahara Conservation Fund"}, "6602367976": {"Name": "Wacher T.", "AuthorID": "6602367976", "AffiliationID": "60009498", "AffiliationName": "Zoological Society of London"}, "7003589897": {"Name": "Durant S.M.", "AuthorID": "7003589897", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "8536629700": {"Name": "Pettorelli N.", "AuthorID": "8536629700", "AffiliationID": "60005453, 60009498", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London"}, "14015549900": {"Name": "Gilbert T.", "AuthorID": "14015549900", "AffiliationID": "108719050", "AffiliationName": "Marwell Wildlife"}}}
