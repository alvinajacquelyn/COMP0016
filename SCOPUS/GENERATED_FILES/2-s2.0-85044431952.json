Histopathology published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAims: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) remains an important therapeutic option for advanced oesophageal cancer (OC). Pathological tumour regression grade (TRG) may offer additional information by directing adjuvant treatment and/or follow-up but its clinical value remains unclear. We analysed the prognostic value of TRG and associated pathological factors in OC patients enrolled in the Medical Research Council (MRC) OE02 trial. Methods and results: Histopathology was reviewed in 497 resections from OE02 trial participants randomised to surgery (S group; n = 244) or NAC followed by surgery [chemotherapy plus surgery (CS) group; n = 253]. The association between TRG groups [responders (TRG1\u20133) versus non-responders (TRG4\u20135)], pathological lymph node (LN) status and overall survival (OS) was analysed. One hundred and ninety-five of 253 (77%) CS patients were classified as \u2018non-responders\u2019, with a significantly higher mortality risk compared to responders [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05\u20132.24, P = 0.026]. OS was significantly better in patients without LN metastases irrespective of TRG [non-responders HR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.33\u20132.63, P < 0.001 versus responders HR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.11\u20134.10, P = 0.024]. In multivariate analyses, LN status was the only independent factor predictive of OS in CS patients (HR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.42\u20132.62, P < 0.001). Exploratory subgroup analyses excluding radiotherapy-exposed patients (n = 48) showed similar prognostic outcomes. Conclusion: Lymph node status post-NAC is the most important prognostic factor in patients with resectable oesophageal cancer, irrespective of TRG. Potential clinical implications, e.g. adjuvant treatment or intensified follow-up, reinforce the importance of LN dissection for staging and prognostication.", "AuthorKeywords": ["neoadjuvant chemotherapy", "oesophageal carcinoma", "tumour regression grade"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Chemotherapy, Adjuvant", "Esophageal Neoplasms", "Female", "Humans", "Lymph Nodes", "Lymphatic Metastasis", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoadjuvant Therapy", "Neoplasm Grading", "Prognosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044431952", "SubjectAreas": [["Pathology and Forensic Medicine", "MEDI", "2734"], ["Histology", "MEDI", "2722"]], "AuthorData": {"35799494400": {"Name": "Davarzani N.", "AuthorID": "35799494400", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering, Maastricht University"}, "56600142200": {"Name": "Hewitt L.C.", "AuthorID": "56600142200", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Department of Pathology, Maastricht University Medical Centre"}, "6602510654": {"Name": "Grabsch H.I.", "AuthorID": "6602510654", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Section of Pathology and Tumour Biology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "35262029700": {"Name": "Hutchins G.G.A.", "AuthorID": "35262029700", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Section of Pathology and Tumour Biology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "24478125000": {"Name": "West N.P.", "AuthorID": "24478125000", "AffiliationID": "60023959", "AffiliationName": "Section of Pathology and Tumour Biology, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology, University of Leeds"}, "24177295600": {"Name": "Nankivell M.", "AuthorID": "24177295600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7201699564": {"Name": "Langley R.E.", "AuthorID": "7201699564", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "36071300500": {"Name": "Cunningham D.", "AuthorID": "36071300500", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal and Lymphoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "36103192800": {"Name": "Smyth E.", "AuthorID": "36103192800", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal and Lymphoma Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital"}, "14029373500": {"Name": "Valeri N.", "AuthorID": "14029373500", "AffiliationID": "60010337", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research"}, "7004433354": {"Name": "Allum W.H.", "AuthorID": "7004433354", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Royal Marsden Hospital"}}}
