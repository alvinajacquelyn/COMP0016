To minimize channel interaction during parallel stimulation, the system is implemented with a power isolation method for crosstalk reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that, with this method, electrodes for different stimulation channels located in close proximity ({<} 2 mm) can deliver current pulses simultaneously with minimum inter-channel crosstalk. The design features a memory-based scheme that manages stimulation to the three canals in parallel. A vestibular evoked potential (VEP) recording unit is included for closed-loop adaptive stimulation control. The main components of the prototype vestibular prosthesis are three ASICs, all implemented in a 0.6-\\mum high-voltage CMOS technology. The measured performance was verified using vestibular electrodes in vitro.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC)", "crosstalk", "implanted device", "parallel stimulation", "power isolation", "stimulation control", "vestibular evoked potential (VEP) recording", "vestibular prosthesis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Channel interactions", "Crosstalk reduction", "Implanted device", "Interchannel cross talk", "parallel stimulation", "Power isolation", "Stimulation systems", "vestibular evoked potential (VEP) recording", "Electric Stimulation Therapy", "Electrodes, Implanted", "Humans", "Prosthesis Design", "Semicircular Canals", "Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921882329", "SubjectAreas": [["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"15922999900": {"Name": "Jiang D.", "AuthorID": "15922999900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "35316911100": {"Name": "Cirmirakis D.", "AuthorID": "35316911100", "AffiliationID": "108957991", "AffiliationName": "BlueCrest CapitalManagement (U.K.) LLP"}, "6603720155": {"Name": "Demosthenous A.", "AuthorID": "6603720155", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
