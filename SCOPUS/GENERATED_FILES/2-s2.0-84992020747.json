We focus on fully-connected analog beamforming networks (FC-ABFNs) and on discrete Fourier transform implementations, and decompose these as a bank of commonly used RF components. We then model their losses based on their S-parameters. Our results reveal that the performance and energy efficiency of hybrid precoding systems are severely affected once these, commonly ignored, losses are considered in the overall design. In this context, we also show that hybrid precoder designs similar to Butler matrices are capable of providing better performances than FC-ABFN for systems with a large number of RF chains.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Analog beamforming networks", "Butler matrix", "hybrid precoding", "massive MIMO", "millimeter wave"], "IndexKeywords": ["Analog beamforming", "Butler matrices", "Overall design", "Precoder design", "Precoding", "Radio frequencies", "RF components", "RF modeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992020747", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56349424500": {"Name": "Garcia-Rodriguez A.", "AuthorID": "56349424500", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "8283849600": {"Name": "Rulikowski P.", "AuthorID": "8283849600", "AffiliationID": "60021378", "AffiliationName": "Nokia Bell Labs"}, "18042693700": {"Name": "Venkateswaran V.", "AuthorID": "18042693700", "AffiliationID": "112560255", "AffiliationName": "Huawei Technologies"}, "23009493900": {"Name": "Masouros C.", "AuthorID": "23009493900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
