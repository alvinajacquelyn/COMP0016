Medical and Veterinary Entomology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Entomological Society. Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), an important vector of West Nile virus (WNV) in the U.S.A., was first detected on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (Ecuador) in the 1980s. However, little is known of its ecology, distribution or capacity for arbovirus transmission in the Gal\u00e1pagos. We characterize details of lifecycle (including gonotrophic period), temporal abundance, spatial distribution, vector competence and host-feeding behaviour. Culex quinquefasciatus was detected on five islands of the Gal\u00e1pagos during 2006\u20132011. A period of 7\u201314 days was required for egg\u2013adult emergence; water salinity above 5 ppt was demonstrated to hinder larval development. Blood-meal analysis indicated feeding on reptiles, birds and mammals. Assessment of WNV vector competency of Gal\u00e1pagos C. quinquefasciatus showed a median infectious dose of 7.41 log 10 plaque-forming units per millilitre and evidence of vertical transmission (minimal filial infection rate of 3.7 per 1000 progeny). The distribution of C. quinquefasciatus across the archipelago could be limited by salt intolerance, and its abundance constrained by high temperatures. Feeding behaviour indicates potential to act as a bridge vector for transmission of pathogens across multiple taxa. Vertical transmission is a potential persistence mechanism for WNV on Gal\u00e1pagos. Together, our results can be used for epidemiological assessments of WNV and target vector control, should this pathogen reach the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands.", "AuthorKeywords": ["disease ecology", "Gal\u00e1pagos Islands", "invasive species", "mosquito biology", "vector-borne disease", "West Nile virus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animal Distribution", "Animals", "Culex", "Ecuador", "Feeding Behavior", "Female", "Introduced Species", "Life History Traits", "Male", "Mosquito Vectors", "Risk", "Salt Tolerance", "West Nile Fever", "West Nile virus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85052820527", "SubjectAreas": [["Parasitology", "IMMU", "2405"], ["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Veterinary (all)", "VETE", "3400"], ["Insect Science", "AGRI", "1109"]], "AuthorData": {"35198035500": {"Name": "Eastwood G.", "AuthorID": "35198035500", "AffiliationID": "60010971, 60028134", "AffiliationName": "New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center"}, "7402115258": {"Name": "Goodman S.J.", "AuthorID": "7402115258", "AffiliationID": "112661522", "AffiliationName": "Gal\u00e1pagos Genetics, Epidemiology and Pathology Laboratory"}, "57203051586": {"Name": "Cunningham A.A.", "AuthorID": "57203051586", "AffiliationID": "112661522", "AffiliationName": "Gal\u00e1pagos Genetics, Epidemiology and Pathology Laboratory"}, "57203054116": {"Name": "Kramer L.D.", "AuthorID": "57203054116", "AffiliationID": "60010971, 60028134", "AffiliationName": "New York State Department of Health, Wadsworth Center"}}}
