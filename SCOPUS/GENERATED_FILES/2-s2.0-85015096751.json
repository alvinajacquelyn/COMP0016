Using a combined ecological and multi-proxy palaeoecological approach we investigated long-term changes in the pathways and processes that underlie eutrophication and water depth effects on lake macrophyte and invertebrate communities across three basins in a shallow lake\u2014Castle Lough, Northern Ireland, UK. Contemporary data allow us to assess how macrophyte assemblages vary in composition and heterogeneity according to basin-specific factors (e.g. variation in water depth), while palaeoecological data (macrophytes and co-occurring invertebrates) enable us to infer basin-specific impacts and susceptibilities to nutrient-enrichment. Results indicate that variability in water depth promotes assemblage variation amongst the lake basins, stimulating within-lake macrophyte assemblage heterogeneity and hence higher lake biodiversity. The palaeo-data indicate that eutrophication has acted as a strong homogenising agent of macrophyte and invertebrate diversities and abundances over time at the whole-lake scale. This novel finding strongly suggests that, as eutrophication advances, the influence of water depth on community heterogeneity is gradually eroded and that ultimately a limited set of eutrophication-tolerant species will become homogeneously distributed across the entire lake.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anthropogenic impact", "Community heterogeneity", "Historical dynamics", "Light limitation", "Lough Erne System", "Multi-proxy study"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015096751", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"35105977100": {"Name": "Salgado J.", "AuthorID": "35105977100", "AffiliationID": "60052106", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio de Palinolog\u00eda y Paleoecolog\u00eda Tropical, Departamento de Ciencias Biol\u00f3gicas, Universidad de Los Andes"}, "7401651179": {"Name": "Brooks S.", "AuthorID": "7401651179", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "7003497830": {"Name": "Okamura B.", "AuthorID": "7003497830", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Life Sciences, Natural History Museum"}, "7003314493": {"Name": "Sayer C.", "AuthorID": "7003314493", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Environmental Change Research Centre, Department of Geography, University College London"}, "7103293305": {"Name": "Davidson T.", "AuthorID": "7103293305", "AffiliationID": "109277982", "AffiliationName": "Department of Bioscience, Section for Ecoinformatics and Biodiversity"}}}
