These isolated anomalies are often not identified in the prenatal period. We describe two cases of isolated anomalies of the left pulmonary artery which were identified on fetal echocardiography and confirmed postnatally, an anomalous left pulmonary artery arising from the base of the left-sided brachiocephalic artery in the setting of a right-sided aortic arch, and a left pulmonary artery sling. These two cases support our current understanding of normal and abnormal development of the extrapericardial arterial vessels and highlight the importance of meticulous attention when sweeping from the three-vessel tracheal view.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anomalous left pulmonary artery", "fetal echocardiography", "left pulmonary artery", "left pulmonary artery sling"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983459851", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"55940194400": {"Name": "Tretter J.T.", "AuthorID": "55940194400", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "57023835000": {"Name": "Rafii D.Y.", "AuthorID": "57023835000", "AffiliationID": "60031167", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Maimonides Medical Center"}, "55302839800": {"Name": "Bhatla P.", "AuthorID": "55302839800", "AffiliationID": "60032105", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pediatric Cardiology, New York University Langone Medical Center"}, "57188998510": {"Name": "Tretter E.M.", "AuthorID": "57188998510", "AffiliationID": "60032497", "AffiliationName": "Ohio State University College of Medicine"}, "55574190847": {"Name": "Anderson R.H.", "AuthorID": "55574190847", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle University"}}}
