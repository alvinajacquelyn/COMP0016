All rights reserved.The evolutionary origin of innovativeness remains puzzling because innovating means responding to novel or unusual problems and hence is unlikely to be selected by itself. A plausible alternative is considering innovativeness as a co-opted product of traits that have evolved for other functions yet together predispose individuals to solve problems by adopting novel behaviours. However, this raises the question of why these adaptations should evolve together in an animal. Here, we develop the argument that the adaptations enabling animals to innovate evolve together because they are jointly part of a life-history strategy for coping with environmental changes. In support of this claim, we present comparative evidence showing that in birds, (i) innovative propensity is linked to life histories that prioritize future over current reproduction, (ii) the link is in part explained by differences in brain size, and (iii) innovative propensity and life-history traits may evolve together in generalist species that frequently expose themselves to novel or unusual conditions. Combined with previous evidence, these findings suggest that innovativeness is not a specialized adaptation but more likely part of a broader general adaptive system to cope with changes in the environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Behavioural plasticity", "Brain evolution", "Creativity", "Developmental constrains", "Pace-of-life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptation, Physiological", "Animals", "Bayes Theorem", "Biological Evolution", "Birds", "Brain", "Feeding Behavior", "Longevity", "Models, Biological", "Organ Size"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959419816", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"]], "AuthorData": {"8928241600": {"Name": "Sol D.", "AuthorID": "8928241600", "AffiliationID": "60006754", "AffiliationName": "CSIC"}, "57148498300": {"Name": "Sayol F.", "AuthorID": "57148498300", "AffiliationID": "60022367", "AffiliationName": "CREAF"}, "34571062100": {"Name": "Lefebvre L.", "AuthorID": "34571062100", "AffiliationID": "60002494", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, McGill University"}, "24536712400": {"Name": "Ducatez S.", "AuthorID": "24536712400", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Biological Sciences, University of Sydney"}}}
