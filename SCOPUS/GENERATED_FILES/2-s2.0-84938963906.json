Focusing on a participatory mapping experience undertaken by the authors in collaboration with local residents in the steep slopes of Bogot\u00e1's eastern hills - an area threatened by forced evictions in the name of ecological preservation and risk protection arguments - we explore why and under what conditions participatory mapping might have the potential to disrupt conflicting interpretations of place and space held both by local residents and state agencies, which in turn can open the room to rework what types of interventions are actually needed and why. We hypothesise that this depends on the extent to which mapping can abridge the different scales at which the state and marginalised communities make sense of a site historically underpinned by different forms of spatial myopia and territorial stigma. This is in our view not just a consequence of the application of participatory mapping techniques per se, but depends on the way in which mapping is used to expand the political space in which different conceptions of a territory can effectively talk to each other.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bogot\u00e1", "Dwelling practices", "Knowledge production", "Participatory mapping", "Spatial politics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938963906", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"7402802360": {"Name": "Allen A.", "AuthorID": "7402802360", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit, The Bartlett, UCL Faculty of the Built Environment"}, "56623902000": {"Name": "Lambert R.", "AuthorID": "56623902000", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit, The Bartlett, UCL Faculty of the Built Environment"}, "55780110300": {"Name": "Apsan Frediani A.", "AuthorID": "55780110300", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit, The Bartlett, UCL Faculty of the Built Environment"}, "56624502000": {"Name": "Ome T.", "AuthorID": "56624502000", "AffiliationID": "60084282", "AffiliationName": "Development Planning Unit, The Bartlett, UCL Faculty of the Built Environment"}}}
