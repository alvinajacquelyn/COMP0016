All rights reserved.Argentina passed a law for humanized birth in 2004 and another law against obstetric violence in 2009, both of which stipulate the rights of women to achieve respectful maternity care. Clinicians and women might still be unaware of these laws, however. In this article, we discuss the case of a fourth-year medical student who, while visiting Argentina from the United States for his obstetric rotation, witnesses an act of obstetric violence. We show that the student\u2019s situation can be understood as one of moral distress and argue that, in this specific instance, it would be appropriate for the student to intervene by providing supportive care to the patient. However, we suggest that medical schools have an obligation to better prepare students for rotations conducted abroad.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Argentina", "Bioethical Issues", "Delivery, Obstetric", "Education, Medical", "Ethics, Medical", "Female", "Humans", "International Educational Exchange", "Legislation, Medical", "Moral Obligations", "Parturition", "Perinatal Care", "Physician-Patient Relations", "Pregnancy", "Schools, Medical", "Stress, Psychological", "Students, Medical", "United States", "Violence", "Women's Rights"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064176741", "SubjectAreas": [["Issues, Ethics and Legal Aspects", "NURS", "2910"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"8928741600": {"Name": "Rubashkin N.", "AuthorID": "8928741600", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Health Sciences, University of California"}, "57190140605": {"Name": "Minckas N.", "AuthorID": "57190140605", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London (UCL)"}}}
