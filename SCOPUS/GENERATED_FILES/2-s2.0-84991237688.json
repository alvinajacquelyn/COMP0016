We provide a first exploration of the implications of bilateral diplomatic missions for the formation of preferential trade agreements (PTAs). We argue that high-level diplomatic relations increase the likelihood of PTA ratification between two countries because diplomats have a number of political and economic incentives to see these agreements implemented. Evidence from a global panel of country dyads spanning 1960\u20132005 indicates that the presence of ambassadors is linked to an increased probability that a PTA will be concluded within a dyad, opening new avenues for further research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["diplomacy", "international trade", "preferential trade agreements", "regionalism"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991237688", "SubjectAreas": [["Political Science and International Relations", "SOCI", "3320"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"37049349800": {"Name": "Plouffe M.", "AuthorID": "37049349800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57191514474": {"Name": "van der Sterren R.", "AuthorID": "57191514474", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
