Using data for 866 mutants from 16 proteins, we examine the relationship between \u0394\u0394G\u00b0 and \u0394TM. A linear relationship is observed for each protein. The slopes of the plots of \u0394TM vs \u0394\u0394G\u00b0 for different proteins scale as N-1, where N is the number of residues in the protein. Thus, a given change in \u0394G\u00b0 causes a much larger change in TM for a small protein relative to the effect observed for a large protein. The analysis suggests that reasonable estimates of \u0394\u0394G\u00b0 for a mutant can be obtained by interpolating measured values of TM. The relationship between \u0394\u0394G\u00b0 and \u0394TM has implications for the design and interpretation of high-throughput assays of protein-ligand binding. So-called thermal shift assays rely upon the increase in stability which results from ligand binding to the folded state. Quantitative relationships are derived which show that the observed thermal shift, \u0394TM, scales as N-1. Hence, thermal shift assays are considerably less sensitive for ligand binding to larger proteins.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["High-throughput assays", "Linear relationships", "Measured values", "Protein energetics", "Protein ligands", "Protein stability", "Protein-ligand interactions", "Thermal unfolding", "Databases, Factual", "Ligands", "Mutagenesis", "Protein Binding", "Protein Stability", "Protein Unfolding", "Proteins", "Thermodynamics", "Transition Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048006998", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Surfaces, Coatings and Films", "MATE", "2508"], ["Materials Chemistry", "MATE", "2505"]], "AuthorData": {"56277144400": {"Name": "Watson M.", "AuthorID": "56277144400", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "57202347323": {"Name": "Monroe J.", "AuthorID": "57202347323", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, Stony Brook University"}, "7006500064": {"Name": "Raleigh D.", "AuthorID": "7006500064", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}}}
