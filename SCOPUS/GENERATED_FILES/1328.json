The standard paradigm for the design and analysis of computer experiments is to employ Gaussian random fields to model computer simulators. Gaussian process models are trained on input-output data obtained from simulation runs at various input values. Following this approach, we propose a sequential design algorithm MICE (mutual information for computer experiments) that adaptively selects the input values at which to run the computer simulator in order to maximize the expected information gain (mutual information) over the input space. The superior computational efficiency of the MICE algorithm compared to other algorithms is demonstrated by test functions and by a tsunami simulator with overall gains of up to 20% in that case.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active learning", "Best linear unbiased prediction", "Gaussian process", "Shallow water equations"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017652998", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Statistics, Probability and Uncertainty", "DECI", "1804"], ["Discrete Mathematics and Combinatorics", "MATH", "2607"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"55262982300": {"Name": "Beck J.", "AuthorID": "55262982300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}, "6602921518": {"Name": "Guillas S.", "AuthorID": "6602921518", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Statistical Science, University College London"}}}
