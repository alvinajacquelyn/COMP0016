This chapter focuses on the multiplicity of activities undertaken by the navy in Irish waters\u2019. Principal among these was the navy\u2019s role in protecting Irish trade in times of both peace and war. The discussion also considers the contribution of Irish resources, both in terms of men and materials, to the eighteenth-century navy. Historians have largely neglected the substantial numbers of Irishmen, both Catholics and Protestants, serving in the eighteenth-century navy, preferring instead to concentrate on the barriers that restricted access to the army or on Ireland\u2019s role in provisioning the fleet. This chapter argues that Ireland\u2019s contribution to the navy was greater than many have previously realised and went far beyond the provision of bread, beef and beer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986596715", "SubjectAreas": [["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"38262073700": {"Name": "Walsh P.", "AuthorID": "38262073700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
