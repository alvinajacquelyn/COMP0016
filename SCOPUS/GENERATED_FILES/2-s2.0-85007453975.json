Here, polycrystalline Ni54Mn25Ga21 is examined using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The initial martensite (Mf) and austenite (Af) finish temperatures were found to be 232 \u00b0 C and 298 \u00b0 C respectively. Mf was observed to decline by 8 \u00b0 C/cycle and Af increased by 1 \u00b0 C/cycle. Both below and surprisingly, above the Curie temperature, the application of an e.m.f. was found to affect the lattice parameters measured. A change in the thermal expansion of the two phases was found around the Curie temperature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ferromagnetic shape memory alloy", "Intermetallic compounds", "Synchrotron radiation", "Thermal expansion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Electrocaloric", "Ferromagnetic shape memory alloy", "Finish temperature", "High temperature", "High temperature shape memory alloy", "In-situ synchrotrons", "Polycrystalline"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007453975", "SubjectAreas": [["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Metals and Alloys", "MATE", "2506"]], "AuthorData": {"56239976700": {"Name": "Azeem M.A.", "AuthorID": "56239976700", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Harwell Science & Innovation Campus"}, "17934662700": {"Name": "Jones N.G.", "AuthorID": "17934662700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge"}, "22953901700": {"Name": "Raghunathan S.L.", "AuthorID": "22953901700", "AffiliationID": "112675704", "AffiliationName": "Cryogenic Ltd."}, "26535145800": {"Name": "Vorontsov V.A.", "AuthorID": "26535145800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept.
