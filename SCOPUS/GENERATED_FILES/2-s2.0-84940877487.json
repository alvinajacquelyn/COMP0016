We take a transcriptomics approach to build the first reproducible multi-tissue RNA expression signature by gene-chip profiling tissue from sedentary normal subjects who reached 65 years of age in good health. Results: One hundred and fifty probe-sets form an accurate classifier of young versus older muscle tissue and this healthy ageing RNA classifier performed consistently in independent cohorts of human muscle, skin and brain tissue (n = 594, AUC = 0.83-0.96) and thus represents a biomarker for biological age. Using the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men birth-cohort (n = 108) we demonstrate that the RNA classifier is insensitive to confounding lifestyle biomarkers, while greater gene score at age 70 years is independently associated with better renal function at age 82 years and longevity. The gene score is 'up-regulated' in healthy human hippocampus with age, and when applied to blood RNA profiles from two large independent age-matched dementia case-control data sets (n = 717) the healthy controls have significantly greater gene scores than those with cognitive impairment. Alone, or when combined with our previously described prototype Alzheimer disease (AD) RNA 'disease signature', the healthy ageing RNA classifier is diagnostic for AD. Conclusions: We identify a novel and statistically robust multi-tissue RNA signature of human healthy ageing that can act as a diagnostic of future health, using only a peripheral blood sample. This RNA signature has great potential to assist research aimed at finding treatments for and/or management of AD and other ageing-related conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aging", "Biomarkers", "Brain", "Cognition", "Female", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Phenotype", "Reproducibility of Results", "RNA", "Skin", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940877487", "SubjectAreas": [["Ecology, Evolution, Behavior and Systematics", "AGRI", "1105"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56818539500": {"Name": "Sood S.", "AuthorID": "56818539500", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Guy's Hospital, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"}, "36835824100": {"Name": "Gallagher I.J.", "AuthorID": "36835824100", "AffiliationID": "60025200", "AffiliationName": "Stirling University, School of Health"}, "7006271249": {"Name": "Timmons J.A.", "AuthorID": "7006271249", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Guy's Hospital, Division of Genetics and Molecular Medicine"}, "25654055100": {"Name": "Crossland H.", "AuthorID": "25654055100", "AffiliationID": "60138585", "AffiliationName": "Derby Royal Hospital, School of Medicine"}, "8854048100": {"Name": "Lunnon K.", "AuthorID": "8854048100", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School"}, "15733082600": {"Name": "Keohane A.", "AuthorID": "15733082600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Old Age Psychiatry"}, "34769841900": {"Name": "Howard R.", "AuthorID": "34769841900", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Old Age Psychiatry"}, "7004828085": {"Name": "Hodges A.", "AuthorID": "7004828085", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, Department of Old Age Psychiatry"}, "17136363000": {"Name": "Rullman E.", "AuthorID": "17136363000", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska University Hospital, Division of Clinical Physiology"}, "7101869124": {"Name": "Gustafsson T.", "AuthorID": "7101869124", "AffiliationID": "60019295", "AffiliationName": "Karolinska University Hospital, Division of Clinical Physiology"}, "7401447675": {"Name": "Phillips B.E.", "AuthorID": "7401447675", "AffiliationID": "60138585", "AffiliationName": "Derby Royal Hospital, School of Medicine"}, "14012757400": {"Name": "Atherton P.J.", "AuthorID": "14012757400", "AffiliationID": "60138585", "AffiliationName": "Derby Royal Hospital, School of Medicine"}, "7004021618": {"Name": "Cederholm T.", "AuthorID": "7004021618", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Uppsala University, Department of Public Health, Caring Sciences, Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism"}, "35511536800": {"Name": "Jensen T.", "AuthorID": "35511536800", "AffiliationID": "112591119", "AffiliationName": "Medical Prognosis Institute A/S"}, "7006194281": {"Name": "van Loon L.J.C.", "AuthorID": "7006194281", "AffiliationID": "60018869", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht University, NUTRIM"}, "7005352603": {"Name": "Lannfelt L.", "AuthorID": "7005352603", "AffiliationID": "60003858", "AffiliationName": "Uppsala University, Department of Public Health and Caring Sciences/Molecular Geriatrics"}, "7103319252": {"Name": "Kraus W.E.", "AuthorID": "7103319252", "AffiliationID": "60005200, 60008724", "AffiliationName": "Duke University School of Medicine, Duke Molecular Physiology Institute"}}}
