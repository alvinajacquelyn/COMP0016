Little is known about the sociodemographic and psychosocial factors associated with use of alcohol and tobacco in disadvantaged groups in comparison to low-risk users. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the characteristics of low-risk users with: disadvantaged smokers only; disadvantaged heavy drinkers only; and disadvantaged concurrent smokers and heavy drinkers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of socioeconomically disadvantaged adult clients attending a community welfare agency assessed tobacco use, alcohol use, demographic, and psychosocial variables. Multivariable analysis using multinomial logistic regression was carried out. Results: The sample consisted of 835 participants; 40% (n = 331) were concurrent users, 31% were smokers only (n = 252), 11% were heavy drinkers only (n = 93), and 18% were low-risk users (n = 149). Compared with those who neither smoked nor consumed alcohol heavily, concurrent users were more likely to be younger, have only some contact with family, have more friends and family who were smokers, have no fixed home address, live alone, and have higher levels of financial stress. Most of these factors were shared by individuals who were smokers only. Factors associated with heavy drinkers only were frequent contact with family and having more friends and family who were smokers. Conclusion: Among those Australians who suffer severe economic hardship, being a concurrent smoker and heavy drinker appears to be associated with more isolated living conditions and financial stress but some contact with family.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol", "concurrent use", "disadvantage", "heavy drinking", "smoking", "tobacco use"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alcohol Drinking", "Australia", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prevalence", "Risk Factors", "Smoking", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Vulnerable Populations", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84961201356", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55169749000": {"Name": "Twyman L.", "AuthorID": "55169749000", "AffiliationID": "60183191, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle"}, "6603014592": {"Name": "Bonevski B.", "AuthorID": "6603014592", "AffiliationID": "60183191, 60010571", "AffiliationName": "School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Newcastle"}, "7202166071": {"Name": "Paul C.", "AuthorID": "7202166071", "AffiliationID": "60089816", "AffiliationName": "Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle"}, "24471011800": {"Name": "Oldmeadow C.", "AuthorID": "24471011800", "AffiliationID": "60089816", "AffiliationName": "Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle"}, "6507070516": {"Name": "Palazzi K.", "AuthorID": "6507070516", "AffiliationID": "60089816", "AffiliationName": "Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle"}, "36054463500": {"Name": "Bryant J.", "AuthorID": "36054463500", "AffiliationID": "60017054, 60010571, 60089816", "AffiliationName": "Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, University of Newcastle, Hunter Medical Research Institute"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}, "6603803167": {"Name": "Siahpush M.", "AuthorID": "6603803167", "AffiliationID": "60016261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health Promotion, Social and Behavioral Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center"}, "6602084604": {"Name": "D'Este C.", "AuthorID": "6602084604", "AffiliationID": "60075989, 60008950", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health, Australian National University"}}}
