Although workplaces are important settings for infectious disease transmission, few studies have collected workplace contact data and estimated workplace contact networks. We use contact diaries, architectural distance measures, and institutional structures to estimate social contact networks within a Swiss research institute. Some contact reports were inconsistent, indicating reporting errors. We adjust for this with a latent variable model, jointly estimating the true (unobserved) network of contacts and duration-specific reporting probabilities. We find that contact probability decreases with distance, and that research group membership, role, and shared projects are strongly predictive of contact patterns. Estimated reporting probabilities were low only for 0-5 min contacts. Adjusting for reporting error changed the estimate of the duration distribution, but did not change the estimates of covariate effects and had little effect on epidemic predictions. Our epidemic simulation study indicates that inclusion of network structure based on architectural and organizational structure data can improve the accuracy of epidemic forecasting models.", "AuthorKeywords": ["contact network", "discordant reports", "epidemic model", "infectious disease", "latent variable model", "measurement error", "reporting error", "social network", "space syntax", "valued network"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013935276", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"35337759700": {"Name": "Potter G.E.", "AuthorID": "35337759700", "AffiliationID": "60003625", "AffiliationName": "Center for Statistics and Quantitative Infectious Disease, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center"}, "12765885300": {"Name": "Smieszek T.", "AuthorID": "12765885300", "AffiliationID": "60020413", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Modelling Methodology, Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College School of Public Health"}, "36915601600": {"Name": "Sailer K.", "AuthorID": "36915601600", "AffiliationID": "60084282, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London"}}}
