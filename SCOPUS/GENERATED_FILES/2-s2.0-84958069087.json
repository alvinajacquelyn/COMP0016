The lethal effects of RT on cancer cells arise primarily from damage to DNA. Ruthenium (Ru) is a transition metal of the platinum group, with potentially less toxicity than platinum drugs. We postulated that ruthenium-arene complexes are radiosensitisers when used in combination with RT. We screened 14 ruthenium-arene complexes and identified AH54 and AH63 as supra-additive radiosensitisers by clonogenic survival assays and isobologram analyses. Both complexes displayed facial chirality. At clinically relevant doses of RT, radiosensitisation of cancer cells by AH54 and AH63 was p53-dependent. Radiation enhancement ratios for 5-10 micromolar drug concentrations ranged from 1.19 to 1.82. In p53-wildtype cells, both drugs induced significant G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Colorectal cancer cells deficient in DNA damage repair proteins, EME1 and MUS81, were significantly more sensitive to both agents. Both drugs were active in cancer cell lines displaying acquired resistance to oxaliplatin or cisplatin. Our findings broaden the potential scope for these drugs for use in cancer therapy, including combination with radiotherapy to treat colorectal cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Apoptosis", "Cell Cycle Checkpoints", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cisplatin", "Colorectal Neoplasms", "DNA Damage", "DNA Repair", "Drug Resistance, Neoplasm", "Humans", "Organometallic Compounds", "Organoplatinum Compounds", "Radiation Tolerance", "Ruthenium", "Solutions", "Tumor Suppressor Protein p53"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958069087", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57198722693": {"Name": "Carter R.", "AuthorID": "57198722693", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK, Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57115402200": {"Name": "Westhorpe A.", "AuthorID": "57115402200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK, Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57115425200": {"Name": "Gallevo C.R.", "AuthorID": "57115425200", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK, Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57115393000": {"Name": "Bark Y.", "AuthorID": "57115393000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK, Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57114742000": {"Name": "Menezes N.", "AuthorID": "57114742000", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK, Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "7407243601": {"Name": "Sharma R.A.", "AuthorID": "7407243601", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "CRUK, Oxford Institute for Radiation Oncology, University of Oxford"}, "57213803588": {"Name": "Romero M.J.", "AuthorID": "57213803588", "AffiliationID": "60028419", "AffiliationName": "Departamento de Qu\u00edmica Inorg\u00e1nica, Universidad de Santiago de Compostela"}, "6603723150": {"Name": "Habtemariam A.", "AuthorID": "6603723150", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}, "7103024488": {"Name": "Sadler P.J.", "AuthorID": "7103024488", "AffiliationID": "60022020", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick"}}}
