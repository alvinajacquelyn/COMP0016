Neuroradiol.The functional imaging technique most widely used in European clinics to differentiate a true parkinsonian syndrome from vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced changes, or essential tremor is dopamine-transporter SPECT. This technique commonly reports dopamine-transporter function, with decreasing striatal uptake demonstrating increasingly severe disease. The strength of dopaminetransporter SPECT is that nigrostriatal degeneration is observed in both clinically inconclusive parkinsonism and early, even premotor, disease. In this clinical review (Part 2), we present the dopamine-transporter SPECT findings in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and dementia with Lewy bodies. The findings in vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced parkinsonism, and essential tremor are also described. It is hoped that this technique will be the forerunner of a range of routinely used, process-specific ligands that can identify early degenerative disease and subsequently guide disease-modifying interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Corpus Striatum", "Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins", "Essential Tremor", "Humans", "Lewy Body Disease", "Multiple System Atrophy", "Parkinsonian Disorders", "Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive", "Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922940486", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57219470277": {"Name": "Booth T.C.", "AuthorID": "57219470277", "AffiliationID": "60020736", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery"}, "57197696960": {"Name": "Nathan M.", "AuthorID": "57197696960", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free Hospital NHS Trust"}, "57216675262": {"Name": "Waldman A.D.", "AuthorID": "57216675262", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Royal Free Hospital NHS Trust"}, "7003969572": {"Name": "Quigley A.M.", "AuthorID": "7003969572", "AffiliationID": "60111785", "AffiliationName": "Department of Imaging, Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust"}, "7102634392": {"Name": "Schapira A.H.", "AuthorID": "7102634392", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005244487": {"Name": "Buscombe J.", "AuthorID": "7005244487", "AffiliationID": "60017488, 60016390", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nuclear Medicine, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
