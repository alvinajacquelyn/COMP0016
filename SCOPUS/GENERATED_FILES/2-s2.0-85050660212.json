In this paper we discuss how the layering and abstractions that commonly appear within computer operating systems are missing within the domain of networking. As such, the lack of abstractions means that interacting with and managing networks has already become a difficult and sometimes cumbersome task. The softwarization process is magnifying this effect. The abstractions that appear in operating systems hide the underlying features of the hardware, presenting elements to programmers and system managers that are easier to understand and to interact with. In this sense, the networking world is far behind. We present some of the lessons learned from these operating system abstractions and consider what could appear in the networking world.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["5g networks", "Network operating system"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050660212", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Information Systems and Management", "DECI", "1802"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"35217494700": {"Name": "Clayman S.", "AuthorID": "35217494700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University College London"}, "36184239500": {"Name": "Tuncer D.", "AuthorID": "36184239500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University College London"}}}
