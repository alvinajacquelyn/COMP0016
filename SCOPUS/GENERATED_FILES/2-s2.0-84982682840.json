By changing the concentration of the precursor combined with operating under flow rate conditions expected to result in a laminar or turbulent mixing, the size of the crystallites could be controlled in the range of 6.5-16.5 nm (median). A quench stream was employed to rapidly cool down the nascent stream of nanoparticles and to elucidate the mechanisms of nucleation and growth. The results show a clear correlation between increasing precursor concentration and crystallite size, which at lower concentrations in particular, decreased in laminar flow and increased in turbulent flow. The smallest particles of 6.5 nm (median) were produced at a precursor concentration of 0.1 M (at a rate of 20 g\u00b7h-1). The materials were characterized using a range of analytical methods including powder X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cobalt oxide nanoparticles", "Continuous hydrothermal flow synthesis", "Flow rate conditions", "Hydrothermal reactor", "Laminar and turbulent flow", "Nucleation and growth", "Powder X ray diffraction", "Precursor concentration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84982682840", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"56823135500": {"Name": "Denis C.", "AuthorID": "56823135500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "36191826400": {"Name": "Gruar R.", "AuthorID": "36191826400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "55652047200": {"Name": "Makwana N.", "AuthorID": "55652047200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6603926697": {"Name": "Darr J.", "AuthorID": "6603926697", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56595697500": {"Name": "Tighe C.", "AuthorID": "56595697500", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}}}
