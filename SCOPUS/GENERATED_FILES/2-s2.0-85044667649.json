Arterial spin labelling (ASL) provides a methodology for measuring CBF non-invasively; however, ASL techniques using only a single inflow time are not sufficient to fully characterize abnormal haemodynamic behaviour in SCA. This study investigated haemodynamic parameters from a multi-inflow-time ASL acquisition in younger (8\u201312 years) and older (13\u201318 years) children with SCA with and without silent cerebral infarction (SCI+/\u2212) (n = 20 and 19 respectively, 6 and 4 SCI+ respectively) and healthy controls (n = 9 and 7 respectively). Compared with controls, CBF was elevated globally in both groups of patients. In the younger SCA patients, blood oxygen content was negatively correlated with CBF in the middle and posterior cerebral artery territories and significantly positively correlated with bolus arrival time (BAT) in the anterior and middle cerebral artery territories. In older children, SCA patients had significantly shorter BAT than healthy controls and there was a significant negative correlation between CBF and oxygen content only in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery, with a trend for a correlation in the anterior cerebral artery but no relationship for the middle cerebral artery territory. In the younger group, SCI+ patients had significantly higher CBF in the posterior cerebral artery territory (SCI+ mean = 92.78 ml/100 g/min; SCI\u2212 mean = 72.71 ml/100 g/min; F = 4.28, p = 0.04), but this no longer reached significance when two children with abnormal transcranial Doppler and one with haemoglobin SC disease were excluded, and there were no significant differences between patients with and without SCI in the older children. With age, there appears to be increasing disparity between patients and controls in terms of the relationship between CBF and oxygen content in the anterior circulation, potentially predicting the risk of acute and chronic compromise of brain tissue.", "AuthorKeywords": ["arterial spin labelling", "cerebral blood flow", "cerebral circulation", "cerebral haemodynamics", "posterior circulation", "sickle cell anaemia"], "IndexKeywords": ["Arterial spin labelling", "Cerebral blood flow", "Cerebral circulation", "Cerebral haemodynamics", "Sickle cell", "Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Anemia, Sickle Cell", "Cerebral Arteries", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Child", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Oxygen", "Perfusion", "Spin Labels", "Time Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044667649", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Spectroscopy", "CHEM", "1607"]], "AuthorData": {"55444368100": {"Name": "Kawadler J.M.", "AuthorID": "55444368100", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "6701651127": {"Name": "Hales P.W.", "AuthorID": "6701651127", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "26643012600": {"Name": "Kirkham F.J.", "AuthorID": "26643012600", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Southampton"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.A.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurosciences, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "7203040369": {"Name": "Barker S.", "AuthorID": "7203040369", "AffiliationID": "60021009, 60000703", "AffiliationName": "Wessex Neurological Centre and Child Health, University Hospital Southampton"}, "57220703222": {"Name": "Cox T.C.S.", "AuthorID": "57220703222", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Great Ormond Street Hospital"}}}
