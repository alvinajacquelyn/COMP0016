Objective: To investigate whether the PPARG2 Pro12Ala genotype modifies the associations of sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) with common measures of insulin sensitivity. Methods: Participants with a high risk of impaired glucose regulation were recruited, United Kingdom, 2010-2011. Sedentary and MVPA time were objectively measured using accelerometers. Fasting and 2-hour post-challenge insulin and glucose were assessed; insulin sensitivity was calculated using Matsuda-ISI and HOMA-IS. DNA was extracted from whole blood. Linear regression examined associations of sedentary time and MVPA with insulin sensitivity and examined interactions by PPARG2 Pro12Ala genotype. Results: 541 subjects were included (average age = 65 years, female = 33%); 18% carried the Ala12 allele. Both sedentary time and MVPA were strongly associated with HOMA-IS and Matsuda-ISI after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, medication, smoking status and accelerometer wear time. After further adjustment for each other and BMI, only associations with Matsuda-ISI were maintained. Every 30 minute difference in sedentary time was inversely associated with a 4% (0, 8%; p = 0.043) difference in Matsuda-ISI, whereas every 30 minutes in MVPA was positively associated with a 13% (0, 26%; p = 0.048) difference. The association of MVPA with Matsuda-ISI was modified by genotype (p = 0.005) and only maintained in Ala12 allele carriers. Conversely, sedentary time was not modified by genotype and remained inversely associated with insulin sensitivity in Pro12 allele homozygotes. Conclusion: The association of MVPA with Matsuda-ISI was modified by PPARG2 Pro12Ala genotype with significant associations only observed in the 18% of the population who carried the Ala12 allele, whereas associations with sedentary time were unaffected.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Aged", "Biomarkers", "Blood Glucose", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Fasting", "Female", "Gene Expression", "Genotype", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Insulin", "Insulin Resistance", "Linear Models", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Activity", "Polymorphism, Genetic", "PPAR gamma", "Risk", "Sedentary Lifestyle"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929301446", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"16302307500": {"Name": "Yates T.", "AuthorID": "16302307500", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60171766", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leicester-Loughborough Diet, Lifestyle, and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit (BRU), Leicester Diabetes Centre"}, "35477152800": {"Name": "Davies M.J.", "AuthorID": "35477152800", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60171766", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leicester-Loughborough Diet, Lifestyle, and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit (BRU), Leicester Diabetes Centre"}, "35784360400": {"Name": "Henson J.", "AuthorID": "35784360400", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60171766", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leicester-Loughborough Diet, Lifestyle, and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit (BRU), Leicester Diabetes Centre"}, "31667536700": {"Name": "Edwardson C.", "AuthorID": "31667536700", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60171766", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leicester-Loughborough Diet, Lifestyle, and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit (BRU), Leicester Diabetes Centre"}, "55708119000": {"Name": "Webb D.", "AuthorID": "55708119000", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60171766", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leicester-Loughborough Diet, Lifestyle, and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit (BRU), Leicester Diabetes Centre"}, "56020570900": {"Name": "Bodicoat D.H.", "AuthorID": "56020570900", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60171766", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Leicester-Loughborough Diet, Lifestyle, and Physical Activity Biomedical Research Unit (BRU), Leicester Diabetes Centre"}, "7005202765": {"Name": "Khunti K.", "AuthorID": "7005202765", "AffiliationID": "60172638, 60171766", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care-East Midlands (CLAHRC-EM), Leicester Diabetes Centre"}, "15053910600": {"Name": "Webb M.", "AuthorID": "15053910600", "AffiliationID": "60028485, 60171766", "AffiliationName": "Leicester Diabetes Centre, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust"}, "36096585300": {"Name": "Howard P.", "AuthorID": "36096585300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "25932124200": {"Name": "Cooper J.A.", "AuthorID": "25932124200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "7005938237": {"Name": "Talmud P.", "AuthorID": "7005938237", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}}}
