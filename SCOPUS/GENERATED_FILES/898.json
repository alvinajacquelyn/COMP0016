Appadurai 1990: 9-10). Alongside such buzzwords as participation, empowerment and poverty reduction (Cornwall and Brock 2005), there has been a programmatic diffusion of ideas that link the realms of culture and development. Thus, culture is said to be \u2018a fundamental component of sustainable development\u2019, \u2018a powerful global economic engine\u2019, \u2018a vehicle for social cohesion and stability\u2019, and \u2018a repository of knowledge, meanings and values that permeate all aspects of our lives\u2019 (UNESCO 2010: 2-6).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85087254678", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"8255681800": {"Name": "Basu P.", "AuthorID": "8255681800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "55947883700": {"Name": "Zetterstrom-Sharp J.", "AuthorID": "55947883700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
