Here, we evaluate donor site healing using a validated scar assessment tool and digital colorimetric technique, which compares colour in a consistent and objective manner. Ten patients (SSG (n = 5) and EG (n = 5)) were included. Donor site scarring was evaluated using the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) at Week 6 and Month 3. Colorimetric measurement was performed at Weeks 3 and 6 and Month 3. The mean donor site healing time for EG was significantly shorter (EG: 4.6 days (95% c.i. 3.8-5.3), SSG: 16.8 days (95% c.i. 13.3-20.1) (P = 0.003)). The VSS scores of the EG donor site were lower at Week 6 and Month 3(P < 0.001). The colour match between the donor site and surrounding skin for EG was better compared with SSG at all time points and was almost identical to their surrounding healthy skin at Month 3. This study is the first to objectively measure the clinical appearance of the EG donor site against SSG. EG donor site has faster healing with excellent scarring and good colour match with its surrounding normal skin at all time points compared with SSG.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical outcome", "colorimetry", "donor site", "epidermal graft", "split-thickness skin graft"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cicatrix", "Epidermis", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Skin Transplantation", "Transplant Donor Site", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056623219", "SubjectAreas": [["Surgery", "MEDI", "2746"], ["Dermatology", "MEDI", "2708"]], "AuthorData": {"56427994500": {"Name": "Kanapathy M.", "AuthorID": "56427994500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "55985666400": {"Name": "Mosahebi A.", "AuthorID": "55985666400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}}}
