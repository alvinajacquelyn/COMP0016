This review summarizes studies showing the multifaceted role of theta rhythm in cognitive functions, including spatial coding, time coding and memory, exploratory locomotion and anxiety-related behaviors. We describe how activity of hippocampal theta rhythm generators \u2212 medial septum, nucleus incertus and entorhinal cortex, links theta with specific behaviors. We review evidence for functions of the theta-rhythmic signaling to subcortical targets, including lateral septum. Further, we describe functional associations of theta oscillation properties \u2212 phase, frequency and amplitude \u2013 with memory, locomotion and anxiety, and outline how manipulations of these features, using optogenetics or pharmacology, affect associative and innate behaviors. We discuss work linking cognition to the slope of the theta frequency to running speed regression, and emotion-sensitivity (anxiolysis) to its y-intercept. Finally, we describe parallel emergence of theta oscillations, theta-mediated neuronal activity and behaviors during development. This review highlights a complex interplay of neuronal circuits and synchronization features, which enables an adaptive regulation of multiple behaviors by theta-rhythmic signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Behaving mice", "Entorhinal cortex", "Grid cells", "Hippocampus", "Memory", "Optogenetics", "Place cells", "Resonance", "Speed"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Behavior, Animal", "Cognition", "Emotions", "Hippocampus", "Humans", "Locomotion", "Memory"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029515822", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"7003589492": {"Name": "Korotkova T.", "AuthorID": "7003589492", "AffiliationID": "60023626", "AffiliationName": "Neuronal Circuits and Behavior Research Group, Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research"}, "7005365083": {"Name": "Ponomarenko A.", "AuthorID": "7005365083", "AffiliationID": "60084824", "AffiliationName": "Behavioural Neurodynamics Group, Leibniz Institute for Molecular Pharmacology (FMP)/NeuroCure Cluster of Excellence"}, "55184879100": {"Name": "Monaghan C.", "AuthorID": "55184879100", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Center for Systems Neuroscience, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and Graduate Program for Neuroscience, Boston University"}, "35462666400": {"Name": "Hasselmo M.", "AuthorID": "35462666400", "AffiliationID": "60019674", "AffiliationName": "Center for Systems Neuroscience, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and Graduate Program for Neuroscience, Boston University"}, "55772749600": {"Name": "Poulter S.", "AuthorID": "55772749600", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Durham"}, "6603001763": {"Name": "Lever C.", "AuthorID": "6603001763", "AffiliationID": "60022175", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Durham"}, "8347859700": {"Name": "Cacucci F.", "AuthorID": "8347859700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology University College London"}, "8347860100": {"Name": "Wills T.", "AuthorID": "8347860100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
