Despite significant research interest, the mechanisms underlying increases in regional blood flow that follow heightened neuronal activity are not completely understood. This article presents a systematic review and analysis of published data reporting the effects of pharmacological or genetic blockade of all hypothesised signalling pathways of neurovascular coupling. Our primary outcome measure was the percent reduction of the neurovascular response assessed using in vivo animal models. Selection criteria were met by 50 primary sources reporting the effects of 79 treatments. Experimental conditions were grouped into categories targeting mechanisms mediated by nitric oxide (NO), prostanoids, purines, potassium, amongst others. Blockade of neuronal NO synthase was found to have the largest effect of inhibiting any individual target, reducing the neurovascular response by 64% (average of 11 studies). Inhibition of multiple targets in combination with nNOS blockade had no further effect. This analysis points to the existence of an unknown signalling mechanism accounting for approximately one third of the neurovascular response.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Brain blood flow", "Functional hyperaemia", "Functional MRI", "Neurovascular coupling", "Systematic review"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Brain", "Cerebrovascular Circulation", "Humans", "Neurovascular Coupling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057604021", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56118823200": {"Name": "Hosford P.", "AuthorID": "56118823200", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57204343249": {"Name": "Gourine A.", "AuthorID": "57204343249", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience, Physiology & Pharmacology, University College London"}}}
