Methods: Calcium was quantified on CCTA images using a new patient-specific attenuation threshold: mean + 2SD of intra-coronary contrast density (HU). Using 335 patient data sets a conversion factor (CF) for predicting CACS from CCTA scores (CCTAS) was derived and validated in a separate cohort (n = 168). Bland\u2013Altman analysis and weighted kappa for MESA centiles and Agatston risk groupings were calculated. Results: Multivariable linear regression yielded a CF: CACS = (1.185 \u00d7 CCTAS) + (0.002 \u00d7 CCTAS \u00d7 attenuation threshold). When applied to CCTA data sets there was excellent correlation (r = 0.95; p < 0.0001) and agreement (mean difference \u221210.4 [95 % limits of agreement \u2212258.9 to 238.1]) with traditional calcium scores. Agreement was better for calcium scores below 500; however, MESA percentile agreement was better for high risk patients. Risk stratification was excellent (Agatston groups k = 0.88 and MESA centiles k = 0.91). Eliminating the dedicated CACS scan decreased patient radiation exposure by approximately one-third. Conclusion: CCTA calcium scores can accurately predict CACS using a simple, individualized, semiautomated approach reducing acquisition time and radiation exposure when evaluating patients for CAD. This method is not affected by the ROI location, imaging protocol, or tube voltage strengthening its clinical applicability. Key Points: \u2022 Coronary calcium scores can be reliably determined on contrast-enhanced cardiac CT \u2022 This score can accurately risk stratify patients \u2022 Elimination of a dedicated calcium scan reduces patient radiation by a third", "AuthorKeywords": ["Agatston score", "Calcium scoring", "Cardiac CT", "Cardiovascular risk", "CT coronary angiography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Coronary Angiography", "Coronary Disease", "Coronary Vessels", "Feasibility Studies", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Multidetector Computed Tomography", "Observer Variation", "Radiation Dosage", "Reproducibility of Results", "Vascular Calcification"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938818976", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"56155789600": {"Name": "Pavitt C.", "AuthorID": "56155789600", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "55984009000": {"Name": "Lindsay A.", "AuthorID": "55984009000", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "57196620044": {"Name": "Ray R.", "AuthorID": "57196620044", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "16834138000": {"Name": "Nicol E.", "AuthorID": "16834138000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College"}, "55249873300": {"Name": "Harron K.", "AuthorID": "55249873300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Paediatric Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Institute of Child Health, UCL"}, "56189450900": {"Name": "Zielke S.", "AuthorID": "56189450900", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7004167743": {"Name": "Rubens M.", "AuthorID": "7004167743", "AffiliationID": "60009009", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, Royal Brompton Hospital"}, "7004446405": {"Name": "Padley S.", "AuthorID": "7004446405", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Imperial College"}, "56252108000": {"Name": "Gordon D.", "AuthorID": "56252108000", "AffiliationID": "60027057", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Royal Marsden Hospital"}}}
