The performance improvement is quantified by experiments with a 7\u00d725 Gb/s wavelength division multiplexing DD single sideband 16-QAM Nyquist-shaped subcarrier modulation system with a net optical information spectral density of 2.3 (b/s)/Hz. The results indicate that this technique can effectively compensate the nonlinearity caused by square-law detection, while, at the same time reducing the DSP complexity, avoiding the need to perform the multiple iterations which are required in previously proposed beating interference cancellation methods.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Direct detection", "Nyquist-pulse shaped subcarrier modulation", "Signal-signal beat interference cancellation", "Spectrally-efficient wavelength division multiplexing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Direct detection", "Interference cancellation", "Multiple iterations", "Optical information", "Single side bands", "Square-law detection", "Sub-carrier modulations", "Time-reducing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013391412", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56703765300": {"Name": "Li Z.", "AuthorID": "56703765300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "55876696500": {"Name": "Sezer Erkilinc M.", "AuthorID": "55876696500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "16053296900": {"Name": "Maher R.", "AuthorID": "16053296900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "36192836100": {"Name": "Galdino L.", "AuthorID": "36192836100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "36140432900": {"Name": "Shi K.", "AuthorID": "36140432900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7005053644": {"Name": "Bayvel P.", "AuthorID": "7005053644", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}, "7003479201": {"Name": "Killey R.", "AuthorID": "7003479201", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Optical Networks Group, University College London"}}}
