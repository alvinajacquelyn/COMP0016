We find that the Coulomb interaction lifts the degeneracy of some SFA trajectories and we identify a set of orbits that, for high enough photoelectron energies, may be associated with rescattering. Furthermore, by performing a direct comparison with the standard SFA, we show that several features in the ATI spectra can be traced back to the influence of the Coulomb potential on different electron trajectories. These features include a decrease in the contrast, a shift towards lower energies in the interference substructure, and an overall increase in the photoelectron yield. All features encountered exhibit very good agreement with the ab initio solution of the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Above-threshold ionization", "Coulomb potential", "Electron propagation", "Electron trajectories", "Photoelectron energy", "Photoelectron yield", "Strong laser field", "Strong-field approximations"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944345551", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"26534484500": {"Name": "Lai X.", "AuthorID": "26534484500", "AffiliationID": "60019706, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "8557426100": {"Name": "Figueira De Morisson Faria C.", "AuthorID": "8557426100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "35093137300": {"Name": "Poli C.", "AuthorID": "35093137300", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}, "57196831306": {"Name": "Schomerus H.", "AuthorID": "57196831306", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Lancaster University"}}}
