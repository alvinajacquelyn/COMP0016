The present study examined the effect of strength of intentional effort on SoA. We manipulated the strength of intentional effort using three types of buttons that differed in the amount of force required to depress them. We used a self-attribution task as an explicit measure of SoA. The results indicate that strength of intentional effort enhanced self-attribution when action-effect congruency was unreliable. We concluded that intentional effort importantly affects the integration of multiple cues affecting explicit judgments of agency when the causal relationship action and effect was unreliable.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Comparator model", "Cue integration", "Intentional effort", "Self-attribution task", "Sense of agency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988448124", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"57191254902": {"Name": "Minohara R.", "AuthorID": "57191254902", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Precision Engineering, The University of Tokyo"}, "56612790000": {"Name": "Wen W.", "AuthorID": "56612790000", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Precision Engineering, The University of Tokyo"}, "55210732400": {"Name": "Hamasaki S.", "AuthorID": "55210732400", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Precision Engineering, The University of Tokyo"}, "57218590669": {"Name": "Yamakawa H.", "AuthorID": "57218590669", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Precision Engineering, The University of Tokyo"}, "35331281800": {"Name": "Yamashita A.", "AuthorID": "35331281800", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Precision Engineering, The University of Tokyo"}, "35448146500": {"Name": "Asama H.", "AuthorID": "35448146500", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Precision Engineering, The University of Tokyo"}, "23489421000": {"Name": "Maeda T.", "AuthorID": "23489421000", "AffiliationID": "60025252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine"}, "56733936400": {"Name": "Kato M.", "AuthorID": "56733936400", "AffiliationID": "60025252", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Keio University School of Medicine"}}}
