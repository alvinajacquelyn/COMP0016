Habal, MD.The ability to calculate intracranial volume (ICV) from 3-dimensional imaging is a useful tool in a craniofacial team's armamentarium. Intracranial volume uses range from decision making to assessment. Various methods to calculate ICV exist including fully manual, semiautomatic, and fully automatic techniques and they are used with varying frequency in craniofacial centres globally. This study aimed to systematically analyze and compare ICV calculations across the 3 methods and provide information to allow the reader to utilize these processes in practice. Twenty-six computed tomography scans from Apert patients were used to compare ICV measurements calculated using the following techniques: fully manual segmentation with OsiriX (taken as the gold standard); semiautomatic segmentation using Simpleware ScanIP; and fully automatic segmentation using FSL neuroimaging software. In addition, to assess the effect that a reducing CT scan slice number had on ICV measurement, 13 scans were remeasured using half, quarter, and an eighth of the slices of the full scan. The manual and semiautomatic techniques had intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.997, and 0.993 respectively. Intracranial volume measurements using the semi-and fully automatic techniques showed high linear correlation with manual techniques (R 2 = 0.993 and R 2 = 0.995). The coefficients of determination for full scan versus half, quarter, and eighth scan were R 2 = 0.98, 0.96, and 0.94 respectively. Similar ICV results can be obtained using manual, semiautomatic, or automatic techniques with decreasing amount of time required to perform each method.
