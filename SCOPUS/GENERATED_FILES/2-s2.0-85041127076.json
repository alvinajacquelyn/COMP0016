Such a widespread role would appear to be incompatible with the inherent lability of the S-nitroso bond, especially its propensity to rapidly react with thiols to generate disulfide bonds. As anticipated, we observed robust and widespread protein S-nitrosation after exposing cells to nitrosocysteine or lipopolysaccharide. Proteins detected using the ascorbate-dependent biotin switch method are typically interpreted to be directly regulated by S-nitrosation. However, these S-nitrosated proteins are shown to predominantly comprise transient intermediates leading to disulfide bond formation. These disulfides are likely to be the dominant end effectors resulting from elevations in nitrosating cellular nitric oxide species. We propose that S-nitrosation primarily serves as a transient intermediate leading to disulfide formation. Overall, we conclude that the current widely held perception that stable S-nitrosation directly regulates the function of many proteins is significantly incorrect. Nitric oxide-related molecules post-translationally modify protein thiols, resulting in functional changes. Such S-nitrosothiols are widely thought to be regulatory end effector modifications. However, Wolhuter et al. show that S-nitrosation predominantly serves as a transient intermediate in the formation of disulfide bonds. This furthers our understanding of how nitric oxide regulates signaling.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cysteine", "disulfide", "protein", "redox", "S-nitrosation", "S-nitrosylation", "signaling", "thiol"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cysteine", "Disulfides", "Humans", "Nitric Oxide", "Nitrosation", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Protein Processing, Post-Translational", "Proteins", "Proteolysis", "Proteomics", "S-Nitrosothiols", "Sulfhydryl Compounds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041127076", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"54382580900": {"Name": "Wolhuter K.", "AuthorID": "54382580900", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, School of Cardiovascular Medicine & Sciences, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence the Rayne Institute, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "55292270000": {"Name": "Switzer C.H.", "AuthorID": "55292270000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, School of Cardiovascular Medicine & Sciences, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence the Rayne Institute, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "14059573000": {"Name": "Burgoyne J.R.", "AuthorID": "14059573000", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, School of Cardiovascular Medicine & Sciences, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence the Rayne Institute, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "7005831172": {"Name": "Eaton P.", "AuthorID": "7005831172", "AffiliationID": "60004111, 60177635, 60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "King's College London, School of Cardiovascular Medicine & Sciences, British Heart Foundation Centre of Research Excellence the Rayne Institute, St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital"}, "56884397100": {"Name": "Whitwell H.J.", "AuthorID": "56884397100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7004011904": {"Name": "Timms J.F.", "AuthorID": "7004011904", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}}}
