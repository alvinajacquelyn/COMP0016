In many advanced economies this surge has been associated with increased import competition from low-wage economies. This paper explores the effects of such competition on manufacturing jobs in the UK. We consider two developments that influenced the nature of international trade: the ascendency of China as an important player in global markets and the accession to the European Union of a number of Eastern European economies in 2004. Both of these changes were associated with a shift in trade regimes and led to a sharp rise in import competition in particular UK manufacturing sectors. We find that these changes are likely to have hastened the decline of UK manufacturing.", "AuthorKeywords": ["de-industrialisation", "globalisation", "import competition", "jobs", "local labour markets", "manufacturing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85032744243", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"24385557500": {"Name": "Foliano F.", "AuthorID": "24385557500", "AffiliationID": "60109561", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research"}, "57173686000": {"Name": "Riley R.", "AuthorID": "57173686000", "AffiliationID": "60109561, 60159834", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Economic and Social Research, Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence, Centre for Macroeconomics"}}}
