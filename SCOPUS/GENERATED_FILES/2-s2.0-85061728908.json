In the present article, we seek to explain in simple terms why this approach is indispensable to pursuing explanations of psychological phenomena broadly, and we review nascent efforts to use this lens to understand anxiety. We conclude with future directions that will be required to advance algorithmic accounts of anxiety. Ultimately, the surplus explanatory value of computational models of anxiety, above and beyond existing neurobiological models of anxiety, impugns the naively reductionist claim that neurobiological models are sufficient to explain anxiety.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anxiety", "computational psychiatry", "decision making", "quantitative theories"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061728908", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"56729918600": {"Name": "Sharp P.", "AuthorID": "56729918600", "AffiliationID": "60025111", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}, "23004344800": {"Name": "Eldar E.", "AuthorID": "23004344800", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Psychology Department, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem"}}}
