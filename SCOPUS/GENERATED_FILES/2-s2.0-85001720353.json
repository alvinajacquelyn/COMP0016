Surrogate faeces, with demonstrated equivalence to human faeces, were used in order to minimize variability in the composition. The yield of bio-oil was studied as a function of the following experimental parameters: original moisture content of the faeces, airflow rate and sand-to-faeces mass ratio. The amount of bio-oil collected was shown to be dependent on the airflow rate and the relative amount of sand used but independent on the moisture content. The bio-oil obtained was characterized by ultimate analysis, water content and calorific value. Under the experimental conditions studied, up to 70 g of bio-oil per kg of dry faeces (HHV = 27.6 kJ/g) can be produced. Finally, experiments demonstrated that sand can be reused after each experiment. The effect of the ash accumulation in the sand matrix on smouldering was investigated over five successive tests with the same batch of sand. The implementation of this technology to other type of organic waste would contribute to the development of an integrated waste treatment technology, in combination with bio-oil production.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bio-oil", "Faeces valorization", "Smouldering combustion", "Waste treatment"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ash accumulation", "Bio oil", "Experimental conditions", "Experimental parameters", "Faeces valorization", "Smouldering combustions", "Treatment technologies", "Ultimate analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85001720353", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Engineering", "ENVI", "2305"], ["Renewable Energy, Sustainability and the Environment", "ENER", "2105"], ["Waste Management and Disposal", "ENVI", "2311"]], "AuthorData": {"57214106727": {"Name": "Yerm\u00e1n L.", "AuthorID": "57214106727", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "56505504800": {"Name": "Carrascal J.", "AuthorID": "56505504800", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "7004558676": {"Name": "Torero J.L.", "AuthorID": "7004558676", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "School of Civil Engineering, The University of Queensland"}, "56504951100": {"Name": "Cormier D.", "AuthorID": "56504951100", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Western Ontario"}, "36682121400": {"Name": "Fabris I.", "AuthorID": "36682121400", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Western Ontario"}, "7007145814": {"Name": "Gerhard J.I.", "AuthorID": "7007145814", "AffiliationID": "60010884", "AffiliationName": "Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Western Ontario"}, "7404914280": {"Name": "Cheng Y.L.", "AuthorID": "7404914280", "AffiliationID": "60016849", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Global Engineering, Department of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry, University of Toronto"}}}
