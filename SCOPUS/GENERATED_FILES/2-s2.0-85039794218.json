The distribution of the template cations in the 12-membered rings channels in the 1-dimensional framework topology was studied; thus the as-prepared products were characterized by means of X-ray powder diffraction, Raman, transmission FTIR, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and elemental analyses and SEM. It was shown that in pure-silica (PS) ZSM-12, TEA cations are well ordered - a superstructure with three-times longer b edge (in comparison to unit cell of empty framework) along the channel is formed, which can be seen by virtue of a few additional peaks in the X-ray powder pattern. Herein we describe that its aluminosilicate counterpart with TEA also contains ordered TEA cations and is isostructural to PS-ZSM-12. Conversely, in both pure-silica and aluminosilicate ZSM-12 frameworks with MTEA, the cations are disordered and no superstructure is formed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["MTEA", "Superstructure", "TEA", "X-ray powder diffraction", "ZSM-12"], "IndexKeywords": ["MTEA", "Quaternary ammonium", "Solid-state NMR spectroscopy", "Structural investigation", "Superstructure", "Tetraethylammonium", "Thermo-gravimetric", "ZSM-12"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039794218", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"]], "AuthorData": {"56563020600": {"Name": "Po\u010dkaj M.", "AuthorID": "56563020600", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "7004166221": {"Name": "Meden A.", "AuthorID": "7004166221", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "6603906364": {"Name": "Golobi\u010d A.", "AuthorID": "6603906364", "AffiliationID": "60031106", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana"}, "6701323269": {"Name": "Zabukovec Logar N.", "AuthorID": "6701323269", "AffiliationID": "60025254", "AffiliationName": "University of Nova Gorica"}, "35115370300": {"Name": "Rangus M.", "AuthorID": "35115370300", "AffiliationID": "60008358", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Chemistry"}, "6602176271": {"Name": "Mali G.", "AuthorID": "6602176271", "AffiliationID": "60008358", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Chemistry"}, "16401902100": {"Name": "Lezcano-Gonzalez I.", "AuthorID": "16401902100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "8889480300": {"Name": "Beale A.M.", "AuthorID": "8889480300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}}}
