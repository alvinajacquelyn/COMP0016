We investigated whether gender distributions might generate signals for increased transmission of GI pathogens among MSM. We examined the percentage male of laboratory-confirmed patient-episodes for patients with no known travel history for 10 GI infections of public health interest in England between 2003 and 2013, stratified by age and region. An adult male excess was observed for Shigella spp. (annual maximum 71% male); most pronounced for those aged 25-49 years and living in London, Brighton and Manchester. An adult male excess was observed every year for Entamoeba histolytica (range 59.8-76.1% male), Giardia (53.1-57.6%) and Campylobacter (52.1-53.5%) and for a minority of years for hepatitis A (max. 69.8%) and typhoidal salmonella (max. 65.7%). This approach generated a signal for excess male episodes for six GI pathogens, including a characterised outbreak of Shigella among MSM. Stratified analyses by geography and age group were consistent with MSM transmission for Shigella. Optimisation and routine application of this technique by public health authorities elsewhere might help identify potential GI infection outbreaks due to sexual transmission among MSM, for further investigation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Gastrointestinal infections", "gender ratio", "men who have sex with men", "outbreaks", "sexually transmitted infections (STIs)", "surveillance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Campylobacter Infections", "Dysentery, Bacillary", "England", "Entamoebiasis", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Giardiasis", "Hepatitis A", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Sex Distribution", "Sexual and Gender Minorities", "Typhoid Fever", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048779074", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"23474763000": {"Name": "Mook P.", "AuthorID": "23474763000", "AffiliationID": "60000064, 60022020", "AffiliationName": "Division of Health Sciences, Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick"}, "57202020751": {"Name": "Gardiner D.", "AuthorID": "57202020751", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Epidemiology Service, Public Health England"}, "56720317600": {"Name": "Kanagarajah S.", "AuthorID": "56720317600", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Epidemiology Service, Public Health England"}, "24448116200": {"Name": "Kerac M.", "AuthorID": "24448116200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Leonard Cheshire Disability and Inclusive Development Centre, University College London"}, "8774236800": {"Name": "McCarthy N.", "AuthorID": "8774236800", "AffiliationID": "120826230", "AffiliationName": "National Institute Health Research (NIHR), Health Protection Research Unit in Gastrointestinal Infections"}, "56243976900": {"Name": "Rawlings C.", "AuthorID": "56243976900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Epidemiology Service, Public Health England"}, "7006447478": {"Name": "Crook P.D.", "AuthorID": "7006447478", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Epidemiology Service, Public Health England"}, "7402326764": {"Name": "Hughes G.", "AuthorID": "7402326764", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV and STI Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7005762559": {"Name": "Field N.", "AuthorID": "7005762559", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Molecular Epidemiology and Translational Research, Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7003661858": {"Name": "Simms I.", "AuthorID": "7003661858", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "HIV and STI Department, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "24338588900": {"Name": "Lane C.", "AuthorID": "24338588900", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Gastrointestinal, Emerging and Zoonotic Infections Department, Public Health England"}}}
