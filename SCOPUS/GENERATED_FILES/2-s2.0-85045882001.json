Computed line lists for the main isotopologues of silicon monohydride, 28SiH, 29SiH, 30SiH and 28SiD are presented. These line lists consider rotation-vibration transitions within the ground X 2\u03a0 electronic state as well as transitions to the low-lying A 2\u0394; and a 4\u03a3 - states. Ab initio potential energy (PECs) and dipole moment curves along with spin-orbit and electronic angular momentum couplings between them are calculated using the multireference configuration interaction level of theory with the MOLPRO package. The PEC for the ground X 2\u03a0 state is refined to available experimental data with a typical accuracy of around 0.01 cm-1 or better. The 28SiH line list includes 11 785 rovibronic states and 1724 841 transitions with associated Einstein-A coefficients for angular momentum J up to 82.5 and covering wavenumbers up to 31 340 cm-1 (\u03bb < 0.319 \u03bcm). Spectra are simulated using the new line list and comparisons made with various experimental spectra. These line lists are applicable up to temperatures of 5000 K, making them relevant to astrophysical objects such as exoplanetary atmospheres and cool stars and opening up the possibility of detection in the interstellar medium. These line lists, called SiGHTLY, are available at the ExoMol (www.exomol.com) and CDS data base websites.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Astronomical data bases: miscellaneous", "Molecular data", "Opacity", "Planets and satellites: atmospheres", "Stars: low-mass"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045882001", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"35605893200": {"Name": "Yurchenko S.N.", "AuthorID": "35605893200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57201728146": {"Name": "Sinden F.", "AuthorID": "57201728146", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23486133800": {"Name": "Lodi L.", "AuthorID": "23486133800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7403559638": {"Name": "Hill C.", "AuthorID": "7403559638", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "7101645601": {"Name": "Tennyson J.", "AuthorID": "7101645601", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57190281691": {"Name": "Gorman M.N.", "AuthorID": "57190281691", "AffiliationID": "60030514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Aberystwyth University"}}}
