Specifically, we address the reproducibility of Bayesian model comparison (and inferences about model parameters) from three important perspectives namely: (i) reproducibility with independent data (obtained by averaging over odd and even trials); (ii) reproducibility over formally distinct models (namely, classic ERP and canonical microcircuit or CMC models); and (iii) reproducibility over inversion schemes (inversion of the grand average and estimation of group effects using empirical Bayes). Our hope was to illustrate the degree of reproducibility one can expect from DCM when analysing different data, under different models with different analyses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bayesian model reduction", "Dynamic causal modelling", "Empirical Bayes", "Fixed effects", "Random effects", "Reproducibility"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954068996", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"23995713600": {"Name": "Litvak V.", "AuthorID": "23995713600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "38962379500": {"Name": "Zeidman P.", "AuthorID": "38962379500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, Institute of Neurology"}, "16303496900": {"Name": "Garrido M.", "AuthorID": "16303496900", "AffiliationID": "60031004", "AffiliationName": "Queensland Brain Institute and Centre for Advanced Imaging, The University of Queensland"}}}
