While validation standards are necessarily high and routinely met in the clinical arena, they have to date been lacking for high-resolution microscopy data sets obtained from the rodent brain. Here we present a tool for optimized automated mouse atlas propagation (aMAP) based on clinical registration software (NiftyReg) for anatomical segmentation of high-resolution 3D fluorescence images of the adult mouse brain. We empirically evaluate aMAP as a method for registration and subsequent segmentation by validating it against the performance of expert human raters. This study therefore establishes a benchmark standard for mapping the molecular function and cellular connectivity of the rodent brain.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Atlases as Topic", "Benchmarking", "Brain", "Connectome", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Software"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84977647212", "SubjectAreas": [["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"56334934100": {"Name": "Niedworok C.", "AuthorID": "56334934100", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "56384712000": {"Name": "Brown A.", "AuthorID": "56384712000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "6602716645": {"Name": "Margrie T.", "AuthorID": "6602716645", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60020649", "AffiliationName": "Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour, University College London"}, "54395497700": {"Name": "Jorge Cardoso M.", "AuthorID": "54395497700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "24376919100": {"Name": "Modat M.", "AuthorID": "24376919100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Translational Imaging Group, Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6603963558": {"Name": "Osten P.", "AuthorID": "6603963558", "AffiliationID": "60029652", "AffiliationName": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory"}}}
