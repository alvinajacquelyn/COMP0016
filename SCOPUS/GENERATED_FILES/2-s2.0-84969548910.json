Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of urea breath test, serology, and stool antigen test, either alone, or in combination, in the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic people in whom H. pylori infection status is sought, so that eradication therapy for H. pylori can be started. If we identify heterogeneity, we plan to explore the following potential sources of heterogeneity: risk of bias, publication status, prospective or retrospective studies, symptomatic versus asymptomatic participants, recent or current use of proton pump inhibitors or antibiotics, different subtypes of tests, and the interval between the index test and reference standard.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84969548910", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"16301178800": {"Name": "Gurusamy K.S.", "AuthorID": "16301178800", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Campus, UCL Medical School, Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7402965763": {"Name": "Davidson B.R.", "AuthorID": "7402965763", "AffiliationID": "60032819, 60029950", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free Campus, UCL Medical School, Department of Surgery, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6508389624": {"Name": "Yaghoobi M.", "AuthorID": "6508389624", "AffiliationID": "60071027", "AffiliationName": "McMaster University Health Sciences Centre, Division of Gastroenterology"}}}
