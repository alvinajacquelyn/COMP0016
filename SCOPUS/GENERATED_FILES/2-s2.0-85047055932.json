Methods: Between June 25, 2014, and June 3, 2015, we carried out a cross-sectional observational study at Moorfields Eye Hospital, London, UK, enrolling 45 children 2-16 years of age with MAC attending our clinics, and their parents. To assess FVA, VR-QoL, and HR-QoL we asked participants to complete three validated tools, the Cardiff Visual Ability Questionnaire for Children (CVAQC), the Impact of Vision Impairment for Children (IVI-C) instrument, and the PedsQL V 4.0. The main outcome measures were the FVA, VR-QoL, and HR-QoL scores, reported by children and parents. Results: In children with MAC, FVA is moderately reduced, with a median CVAQC score of \u22121.4 (IQR, \u22122.4 to 0.4; range, \u22123.0 [higher FVA] to +2.8 [lower FVA]). VR-QoL and HR-QoL are greatly reduced, with an IVI-C median score of 63 (IQR, 52-66; normal VR-QoL, 96), a median self-reported PedsQL score of 77 (IQR, 71-90; normal HR-QoL, 100) and parental score of 79 (IQR, 61-93), and a family impact score of 81 (67-93). Psychosocial well-being scores are lower than physical well-being scores. Parents and children have a different perception of the impact of the condition on the child's HR-QoL. Conclusions: MAC has a significant impact on a child's FVA and QoL, similar to that described by children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and chronic systemic conditions. Children and families may benefit from psychosocial support.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anophthalmos", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Coloboma", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Health Status", "Humans", "Male", "Microphthalmos", "Quality of Life", "Sickness Impact Profile", "Vision Disorders", "Visual Acuity"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047055932", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"]], "AuthorData": {"22950013600": {"Name": "Dahlmann-Noor A.", "AuthorID": "22950013600", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55281650200": {"Name": "Tailor V.", "AuthorID": "55281650200", "AffiliationID": "60013148, 60016691, 60172674", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Moorfields Eye Hospital and UCL Institute of Ophthalmology"}, "7005183974": {"Name": "Brookes J.", "AuthorID": "7005183974", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7006578947": {"Name": "Khaw P.T.", "AuthorID": "7006578947", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "7005268305": {"Name": "Bunce C.", "AuthorID": "7005268305", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Primary Care & Public Health Sciences, King's College London"}, "7101944790": {"Name": "Papadopoulos M.", "AuthorID": "7101944790", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Glaucoma Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "55463366200": {"Name": "Adams G.", "AuthorID": "55463366200", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "12753169100": {"Name": "Abou-Rayyah Y.", "AuthorID": "12753169100", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "Adnexal Service, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}}}
