As part of the study, we compared simulations using a Newtonian and a Carreau-Yasuda rheology model. We also investigated the viability of using downscaled velocities to reduce the required resolution. Simulations with unscaled velocities predict the maximum flow velocity with an error of less than 9%, independent of the rheology model chosen. The accuracy of the simulation predictions worsens considerably when simulations are run at reduced velocity, as is for example the case when inflow velocities from healthy individuals are used on a vascular model of a stroke patient. Our results demonstrate the importance of using directly measured and patient-specific inflow velocities when simulating blood flow in MCAs. We conclude that localized TCD measurements together with predictive simulations can be used to obtain flow estimates with high fidelity over a larger region, and reduce the need for more invasive flow measurement procedures.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood flow", "Computational fluid dynamics", "High performance computing", "Lattice-Boltzmann", "Middle cerebral artery", "Transcranial Doppler", "Validation study"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048663377", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Physiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2737"]], "AuthorData": {"23049787700": {"Name": "Groen D.", "AuthorID": "23049787700", "AffiliationID": "60020623", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, Brunel University London"}, "56493993600": {"Name": "Richardson R.A.", "AuthorID": "56493993600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Computational Science, University College London"}, "7005747590": {"Name": "Coveney P.V.", "AuthorID": "7005747590", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "57194551544": {"Name": "Coy R.", "AuthorID": "57194551544", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Mathematics and Physics in the Life Sciences and Experimental Biology, University College London"}, "6701642358": {"Name": "Schiller U.D.", "AuthorID": "6701642358", "AffiliationID": "60026610", "AffiliationName": "School of Health Research, Clemson University"}, "6603067631": {"Name": "Chandrashekar H.", "AuthorID": "6603067631", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London"}, "36015499300": {"Name": "Robertson F.", "AuthorID": "36015499300", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Lysholm Department of Neuroradiology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London"}}}
