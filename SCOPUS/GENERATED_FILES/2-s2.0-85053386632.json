Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Academic diligence is the ability to regulate behavior in the service of goals, and a predictor of educational attainment. Here we combined behavioral, structural MRI, functional MRI and connectivity data to investigate the neurocognitive correlates of diligence. We assessed whether individual differences in diligence are related to the interplay between frontal control and striatal reward systems, as predicted by the dual-systems hypothesis of adolescent development. We obtained behavioral measures of diligence from 40 adolescent girls (aged 14-15 years) using the Academic Diligence Task. We collected structural imaging data for each participant, as well as functional imaging data during an emotional go-no-go self-control task. As predicted by the dual-systems hypothesis, we found that inferior frontal activation and gyrification correlated with academic diligence. However, neither striatal activation nor structure, nor fronto-striatal connectivity, showed clear associations with diligence. Instead, we found prominent activation of temporal areas during the go-no-go task. This suggests that academic diligence is associated with an extended network of brain regions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Academic diligence", "adolescence", "dual systems hypothesis", "inferior frontal gyrus", "striatum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Academic Success", "Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Adolescent Development", "Connectome", "Corpus Striatum", "Female", "Functional Neuroimaging", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Prefrontal Cortex"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85053386632", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56205456800": {"Name": "Fuhrmann D.", "AuthorID": "56205456800", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57195136369": {"Name": "Leung J.", "AuthorID": "57195136369", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "57203894312": {"Name": "Griffin C.", "AuthorID": "57203894312", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "26643513600": {"Name": "Blakemore S.", "AuthorID": "26643513600", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "26635865900": {"Name": "Schweizer S.", "AuthorID": "26635865900", "AffiliationID": "60029069, 60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}}}
