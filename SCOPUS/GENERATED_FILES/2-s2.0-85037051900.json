In this chapter we first outline the unique utility of structural imaging in understanding HD and discuss some of the acquisition and analysis techniques currently available. We review the existing literature to summarize what we know so far about structural brain changes across the spectrum of disease from premanifest through to manifest disease. We then consider how these neuroimaging findings relate to patient function and nonimaging biomarkers, and can be used to predict disease onset. Finally we review the utility of imaging measures for assessment of treatment efficacy in clinical trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["biomarker", "cortex", "Huntington disease", "MRI", "striatum", "volumetric", "white matter"], "IndexKeywords": ["Brain", "Heterozygote", "Humans", "Huntington Disease", "Neuroimaging"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037051900", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6602959028": {"Name": "Scahill R.", "AuthorID": "6602959028", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "24536775600": {"Name": "Andre R.", "AuthorID": "24536775600", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7006745684": {"Name": "Tabrizi S.", "AuthorID": "7006745684", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Disease, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7005544159": {"Name": "Aylward E.", "AuthorID": "7005544159", "AffiliationID": "60015481, 60018922", "AffiliationName": "Center for Integrative Brain Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, University of Washington"}}}
