In vivo, grayscale intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) provides more in-depth information on coronary artery plaque burden than conventional angiography but is unable to accurately distinguish between noncalcific tissue types within the plaque. An analysis of IVUS radiofrequency backscatter based on spectral pattern recognition, such as virtual histology IVUS, allows detailed scrutiny of plaque composition and classification of coronary lesions. This review discusses the virtual histology IVUS technology and its accuracy in identifying vulnerable plaque features, focusing on its use in predicting patient outcomes after acute coronary syndrome, and its limitations in clinical practice.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acute coronary syndrome", "intravascular imaging", "intravascular ultrasound", "percutaneous coronary intervention", "VH IVUS", "vulnerable plaque"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Coronary Syndrome", "Humans", "Plaque, Atherosclerotic", "Ultrasonography, Interventional", "Validation Studies as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958824484", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56427706400": {"Name": "Sinclair H.", "AuthorID": "56427706400", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Centre, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "55737603300": {"Name": "Veerasamy M.", "AuthorID": "55737603300", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Centre, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "13006459000": {"Name": "Egred M.", "AuthorID": "13006459000", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Centre, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "55390915800": {"Name": "Kunadian V.", "AuthorID": "55390915800", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Centre, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "15822122100": {"Name": "Bourantas C.", "AuthorID": "15822122100", "AffiliationID": "60018514, 60001239", "AffiliationName": "Cardiothoracic Centre, Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals National Health Service Foundation Trust"}, "7103065899": {"Name": "Nair A.", "AuthorID": "7103065899", "AffiliationID": "60021160", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland Clinic"}, "26637629000": {"Name": "Calvert P.A.", "AuthorID": "26637629000", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "14010425300": {"Name": "Brugaletta S.", "AuthorID": "14010425300", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Thorax Institute, University of Barcelona"}, "55930323400": {"Name": "Mintz G.S.", "AuthorID": "55930323400", "AffiliationID": "60015884", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cardiology, Cardiovascular Research Foundation"}}}
