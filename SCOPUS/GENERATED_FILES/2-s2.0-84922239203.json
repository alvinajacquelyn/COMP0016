Delineating age-related differences within striatal circuitry can provide insights into neural mechanisms underlying ontogenic behavioral changes and vulnerabilities to mental disorders. To this end, a dual ventral/dorsal model of striatal function was examined using resting state intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) imaging in 106 healthy individuals, ages 9-44. Broadly, the dorsal striatum (DS) is connected to prefrontal and parietal cortices and contributes to cognitive processes; the ventral striatum (VS) is connected to medial orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, and contributes to affective valuation and motivation. Findings revealed patterns of age-related changes that differed between VS and DS iFCs. We found an age-related increase in DS iFC with posterior cingulate cortex (pCC) that stabilized after the mid-twenties, but a decrease in VS iFC with anterior insula (aIns) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) that persisted into mid-adulthood. These distinct developmental trajectories of VS vs. DS iFC might underlie adolescents' unique behavioral patterns and vulnerabilities to psychopathology, and also speaks to changes in motivational networks that extend well past 25 years old.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Development", "Functional-connectivity", "Prefrontal-cortex", "Resting-state", "Striatum"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aging", "Brain", "Cerebral Cortex", "Child", "Corpus Striatum", "Female", "Gyrus Cinguli", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neostriatum", "Nerve Net", "Neural Conduction", "Parietal Lobe", "Social Behavior", "Social Environment", "Ventral Striatum", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922239203", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"36931224200": {"Name": "Porter J.N.", "AuthorID": "36931224200", "AffiliationID": "60024324", "AffiliationName": "University of Iowa Hospitals, Clinics Department of Neurology"}, "8743913200": {"Name": "Collins P.F.", "AuthorID": "8743913200", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota, Department of Psychology"}, "6701475304": {"Name": "Luciana M.", "AuthorID": "6701475304", "AffiliationID": "60029445", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota, Center for Neurobehavioral Development"}, "25633006700": {"Name": "Roy A.K.", "AuthorID": "25633006700", "AffiliationID": "60015095", "AffiliationName": "Fordham University, Department of Psychology"}, "36107528600": {"Name": "Benson B.", "AuthorID": "36107528600", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Head of Neurodevelopment of Reward Sys-tems, Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety (NFA), National Institute of Mental Health/NIH"}, "55037261300": {"Name": "Carlisi C.", "AuthorID": "55037261300", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Head of Neurodevelopment of Reward Sys-tems, Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety (NFA), National Institute of Mental Health/NIH"}, "16943112200": {"Name": "Leibenluft E.", "AuthorID": "16943112200", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Head of Neurodevelopment of Reward Sys-tems, Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety (NFA), National Institute of Mental Health/NIH"}, "7102750324": {"Name": "Pine D.S.", "AuthorID": "7102750324", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Head of Neurodevelopment of Reward Sys-tems, Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety (NFA), National Institute of Mental Health/NIH"}, "7201640283": {"Name": "Ernst M.", "AuthorID": "7201640283", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Head of Neurodevelopment of Reward Sys-tems, Section on Neurobiology of Fear and Anxiety (NFA), National Institute of Mental Health/NIH"}}}
