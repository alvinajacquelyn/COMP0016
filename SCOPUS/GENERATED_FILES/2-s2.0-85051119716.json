The resulting silicas were subsequently amine functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (NH2-MTS), [3-(2-aminoethylamino)-propyl]trimethoxysilane (NN-MTS), and [3-(diethylamino)propyl]trimethoxysilane(DN-MTS) to introduce surface basicity. Surface physicochemical properties were characterized by field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEGSEM), nitrogen porosimetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). As-synthesised materials exhibit type IV adsorption-desorption isotherms characteristic of mesoporous structures. Clusters of spherical shaped materials were observed by FEGSEM, suggesting growth of silica occurs within colloidal dispersions. High-resolution N 1s XP spectra and DRIFT spectra confirmed the presence of amine groups in the organo-amine functionalised mesoporous silicas. The amine functionalised mesoporous silicas were active for the transesterification of tributyrin with methanol, with conversion found to increase from NH2-MTS< NN-MTS< DN-MTS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["catalytic", "heterogenous", "mesoscale", "porosity", "sol-gel"], "IndexKeywords": ["3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane", "Adsorption desorption isotherms", "Amine-functionalized mesoporous silica", "catalytic", "Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopies", "heterogenous", "Mesoscale", "Physicochemical property"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85051119716", "SubjectAreas": [["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Mechanics of Materials", "ENGI", "2211"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57203277515": {"Name": "Elimbinzi E.", "AuthorID": "57203277515", "AffiliationID": "60071577", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, College of Natural and Applied Sciences, University of Dar es Salaam"}, "55857899400": {"Name": "Nyandoro S.S.", "AuthorID": "55857899400", "AffiliationID": "60071577", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, College of Natural and Applied Sciences, University of Dar es Salaam"}, "6506476356": {"Name": "Mubofu E.B.", "AuthorID": "6506476356", "AffiliationID": "60071577", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Department, College of Natural and Applied Sciences, University of Dar es Salaam"}, "53980431800": {"Name": "Osatiashtiani A.", "AuthorID": "53980431800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute (EBRI), Aston University, Aston Triangle"}, "56035830400": {"Name": "Manayil J.C.", "AuthorID": "56035830400", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute (EBRI), Aston University, Aston Triangle"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.A.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute (EBRI), Aston University, Aston Triangle"}, "7405628120": {"Name": "Lee A.F.", "AuthorID": "7405628120", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, RMIT University"}, "7403725899": {"Name": "Wilson K.", "AuthorID": "7403725899", "AffiliationID": "60011362", "AffiliationName": "School of Science, RMIT University"}}}
