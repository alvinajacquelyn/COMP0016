Methods: Identification of the underlying etiology and response to treatment in 377 infants enrolled in a clinical trial of the treatment of infantile spasms between 2007 and 2014 using a systematic review of history, examination, and investigations. They were classified using the pediatric adaptation of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Results: A total of 219 of 377 (58%) had a proven etiology, of whom 128 (58%) responded, 58 of 108 (54%) were allocated hormonal treatment, and 70 of 111 (63%) had combination therapy. Fourteen of 17 (82%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 59% to 94%) infants with stroke and infarct responded (compared to 114 of 202 for the rest of the proven etiology group (56%, 95% CI 48% to 62%, chi-square 4.3, P =.037): the better response remains when treatment allocation and lead time are taken into account (odds ratio 5.1, 95% CI 1.1 to 23.6, P =.037). Twenty of 37 (54%, 95% CI 38% to 70%) infants with Down syndrome had cessation of spasms compared to 108 of 182 (59%, 95% CI 52% to 66%, chi-square 0.35, P =.55) for the rest of the proven etiology group. The lack of a significant difference remains after taking treatment modality and lead-time into account (odds ratio 0.8, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.7, P =.62). In Down syndrome infants, treatment modality did not appear to affect response: 11 of 20 (55%) allocated hormonal therapy responded, compared to 9 of 17 (53%) allocated combination therapy. Significance: This classification allows easy comparison with other classifications and with our earlier reports. Stroke and infarct have a better outcome than other etiologies, whereas Down syndrome might not respond to the addition of vigabatrin to hormonal treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["etiology", "infantile spasms", "West syndrome"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070764049", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7203032305": {"Name": "Osborne J.P.", "AuthorID": "7203032305", "AffiliationID": "60027647", "AffiliationName": "Children's Department, Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7401520116": {"Name": "Edwards S.W.", "AuthorID": "7401520116", "AffiliationID": "60027647", "AffiliationName": "Children's Department, Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7202875563": {"Name": "Hancock E.", "AuthorID": "7202875563", "AffiliationID": "60027647", "AffiliationName": "Children's Department, Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7004263408": {"Name": "O'Callaghan F.J.K.", "AuthorID": "7004263408", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health, University College London"}, "36445359400": {"Name": "Dietrich Alber F.", "AuthorID": "36445359400", "AffiliationID": "60002695", "AffiliationName": "Division of Neurology/Neuropsychology, University Children's Hospital"}, "7410016800": {"Name": "Johnson A.L.", "AuthorID": "7410016800", "AffiliationID": "60015879, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, Institute of Clinical Trials and Methodology"}, "55749016900": {"Name": "Kennedy C.R.", "AuthorID": "55749016900", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital"}, "16424773200": {"Name": "Likeman M.", "AuthorID": "16424773200", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Radiology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"}, "7004918655": {"Name": "Lux A.L.", "AuthorID": "7004918655", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"}, "23467176800": {"Name": "Mallick A.", "AuthorID": "23467176800", "AffiliationID": "60015756", "AffiliationName": "Department of Paediatric Neurology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children"}, "7103172855": {"Name": "Mackay M.", "AuthorID": "7103172855", "AffiliationID": "60026489", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Department, The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne"}, "7401830962": {"Name": "Newton R.W.", "AuthorID": "7401830962", "AffiliationID": "60023969", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital"}, "7202695797": {"Name": "Nolan M.", "AuthorID": "7202695797", "AffiliationID": "60020518", "AffiliationName": "Starship Children's Health"}, "6602252366": {"Name": "Pressler R.", "AuthorID": "6602252366", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Clinical Neurosciences"}, "13614211400": {"Name": "Rating D.", "AuthorID": "13614211400", "AffiliationID": "60016908", "AffiliationName": "University of Heidelberg"}, "7202241048": {"Name": "Schmitt B.", "AuthorID": "7202241048", "AffiliationID": "60002695", "AffiliationName": "Division of Paediatric Neurology, University Children's Hospital"}, "7004750171": {"Name": "Verity C.M.", "AuthorID": "7004750171", "AffiliationID": "60017488", "AffiliationName": "PIND research, Addenbrookes Hospital"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
