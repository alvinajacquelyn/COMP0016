Such lentiviral vectors have the potential to infect a wide variety of cell types. However, despite this advantage, the ability to transduce primary human T cells remains challenging and methods to achieve efficient gene transfer are often time consuming and expensive. We describe a method for generating lentivirus that is simple to perform and does not require the purchase of non-standard equipment to transduce primary human T cells. Therefore, we provide an optimized protocol that is easy to implement and allow transduction with high efficiency and reproducibility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD45RA+", "CD4+ T cells", "Human T cell", "Lentiviral vector", "Lentivirus", "Primary", "Titer"], "IndexKeywords": ["Gene Transfer Techniques", "Genetic Vectors", "HIV-1", "Humans", "Lentivirus", "Primary Cell Culture", "T-Lymphocytes", "Transduction, Genetic", "Transfection", "Transgenes"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979284344", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"7401653703": {"Name": "Kennedy A.", "AuthorID": "7401653703", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "54779465000": {"Name": "Cribbs A.P.", "AuthorID": "54779465000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
