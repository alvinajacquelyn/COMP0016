The main focus is placed on copper minerals, ores, slags, slagged sherds and metal droplets coming from four Vin\u010da culture settlements in Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina: Belovode, Plo\u010dnik, Vin\u010da and Gornja Tuzla, all dated between c. 5400 and 4400 BC. Chemical study of copper minerals throughout all sites points at striking uniformity in selecting black and green minerals from the early days of the settlements\u2019 occupation, some of which predate the metal smelting events. Microstructural examination of metal production debris showed convincing technological similarity throughout c. six centuries of copper making in the studied sites, as well as a consistent choice of black and green ores for metal extraction. We argue that black and green ores were intentionally selected as ingredients for the metal smelting \u2018recipe\u2019 in the early stages of Balkan metallurgy based on the knowledge related to their characteristic visual aspects. This finding demonstrates how important the adequate combination of colours was for the early copper metalworkers and suggests a unique technological trajectory for the evolution of metallurgy in this part of the world. It also illustrates the capacity that micro-research carries in addressing the how and why of the emergence of metallurgy, and outlines a methodology for future studies of early metallurgies worldwide.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Balkans", "Colour", "Copper slag", "Metallurgy", "Technology", "Vin\u010da culture"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957969598", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"36169346800": {"Name": "Radivojevi\u0107 M.", "AuthorID": "36169346800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College London"}, "57202699283": {"Name": "Rehren T.", "AuthorID": "57202699283", "AffiliationID": "60107608", "AffiliationName": "UCL Qatar"}}}
