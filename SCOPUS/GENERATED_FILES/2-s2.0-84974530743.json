We report on fragment screening by high-throughput docking to the BRPF1 bromodomain which resulted in six chemotypes with very favorable ligand efficiency (0.45-0.50 kcal/mol per non-hydrogen atom). Twenty crystal structures of BRPF1/ligand complexes show structural conservation in the acetyllysine binding site, common binding motifs, and unusual interactions (e.g., the replacement of a conserved water molecule). The structural information is useful for the design of chemical probes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing", "Binding Sites", "Crystallography, X-Ray", "Humans", "Ligands", "Molecular Docking Simulation", "Molecular Structure", "Nuclear Proteins", "Protein Domains", "Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs", "Water"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84974530743", "SubjectAreas": [["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Drug Discovery", "PHAR", "3002"]], "AuthorData": {"57189223300": {"Name": "Zhu J.", "AuthorID": "57189223300", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}, "7006219601": {"Name": "Caflisch A.", "AuthorID": "7006219601", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Z\u00fcrich"}}}
