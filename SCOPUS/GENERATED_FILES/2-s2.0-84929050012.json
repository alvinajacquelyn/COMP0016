Both children and adults showed an EBB, but that of children was larger. The EEB did not correlate with other measures of egocentricity. Crucially, the developmental differences in EEB were mediated by age-related changes in conflict processing and not visual perspective taking, response inhibition, or processing speed. This indicates that different types of egocentricity develop independently of one another and that the increased ability to overcome EEB can be explained by age-related improvements in conflict processing.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Child", "Child Development", "Conflict (Psychology)", "Emotions", "Executive Function", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Taste Perception", "Theory of Mind", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929050012", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"]], "AuthorData": {"56494150200": {"Name": "Hoffmann F.", "AuthorID": "56494150200", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "7102867452": {"Name": "Singer T.", "AuthorID": "7102867452", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}, "14621701400": {"Name": "Steinbeis N.", "AuthorID": "14621701400", "AffiliationID": "60025323", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences"}}}
