A purpose-built longitudinal automatic method was used to segment WMH using constraints derived from an atlas-based model selection applied to a time-averaged image. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the differences in rate of change across diagnosis and genetic groups. After adjustment for covariates (age, sex, and total intracranial volume), homozygous APOE \u03b54\u03b54 subjects had a significantly higher rate of WMH accumulation (22.5% per year 95% CI [14.4, 31.2] for a standardized population having typical values of covariates) compared with the heterozygous (\u03b54\u03b53) subjects (10.0% per year [6.7, 13.4]) and homozygous \u03b53\u03b53 (6.6% per year [4.1, 9.3]) subjects. Rates of accumulation increased with diagnostic severity; controls accumulated 5.8% per year 95% CI: [2.2, 9.6] for the standardized population, early mild cognitive impairment 6.6% per year [3.9, 9.4], late mild cognitive impairment 12.5% per year [8.2, 17.0] and AD subjects 14.7% per year [6.0, 24.0]. Following adjustment for APOE status, these differences became nonstatistically significant suggesting that APOE \u03b54 genotype is the major driver of accumulation of WMH volume rather than diagnosis of AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "APOE", "Longitudinal", "White matter hyperintensities"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alleles", "Alzheimer Disease", "Apolipoprotein E4", "Cohort Studies", "Female", "Genotype", "Heterozygote", "Homozygote", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Neuroimaging", "Severity of Illness Index", "White Matter"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85013177866", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Aging", "BIOC", "1302"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"]], "AuthorData": {"56198868700": {"Name": "Sudre C.H.", "AuthorID": "56198868700", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57204636980": {"Name": "Cardoso M.J.", "AuthorID": "57204636980", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7102989379": {"Name": "Barkhof F.", "AuthorID": "7102989379", "AffiliationID": "60001997", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Centre"}, "6602233595": {"Name": "Ourselin S.", "AuthorID": "6602233595", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "35556415800": {"Name": "Barnes J.", "AuthorID": "35556415800", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7201444328": {"Name": "Fox N.", "AuthorID": "7201444328", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "7101816884": {"Name": "Frost C.", "AuthorID": "7101816884", "AffiliationID": "60031331, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Epidemiology and Medical Health, University College London"}}}
