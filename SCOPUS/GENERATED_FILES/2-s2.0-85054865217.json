Ltd. 2018.The notion of \u2018suburbia\u2019 is increasingly useless as a singular, simple description of place, identity or political culture. Focusing particularly on ethnic and religious diversity highlights the intensely differentiated nature of outer London. The tropes of \u2018Metroland\u2019, and \u2018leafy suburbia\u2019 deflect from recognition of this diversity, and the broadly-found expectations about patterns of migration, suburbanisation and cultural change loosely associated with the Chicago School of urban sociology have less and less applicability to modern London. Religious and ethnic diversity in suburbia poses significant challenges for political parties. In particular, Labour\u2019s difficulties in appealing to different constituencies, often expressed geographically in terms of the differences between inner London and the white working class areas of post-industrial Britain, are also present in the micro-politics of adjacent areas of outer London. New forms of religion, and especially the development of large new worship spaces, increasingly common in outer London, also have significant consequences for the local politics of suburbia.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chicago school", "Ethnicity", "London", "Metroland", "Religion", "Suburbs"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054865217", "SubjectAreas": [["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"]], "AuthorData": {"35306914100": {"Name": "Gilbert D.", "AuthorID": "35306914100", "AffiliationID": "60020595", "AffiliationName": "Royal Holloway, University of London"}, "7004389465": {"Name": "Dwyer C.", "AuthorID": "7004389465", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "26027773900": {"Name": "Ahmed N.", "AuthorID": "26027773900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
