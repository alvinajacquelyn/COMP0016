For the first time, the last day of the conference focused solely on new medical devices and neuromodulation. The current article summarises the presentations of that day, focusing first on EEG- and ECG based methods and devices for seizure detection. These methodologies form the basis for novel cardiac-based methods of vagal nerve and responsive deep brain stimulation that rely on the prediction or early detection of seizures and that are also included in this article.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deep brain stimulation", "ECG", "EEG", "Seizure detection", "Vagal nerve stimulation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Anticonvulsants", "Brain", "Heart", "Humans", "Seizures", "Spain"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85009990165", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"55123546600": {"Name": "Bialer M.", "AuthorID": "55123546600", "AffiliationID": "60007903", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Drug Research, School of Pharmacy and David R.
