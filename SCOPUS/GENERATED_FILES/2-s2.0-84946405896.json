Methods: A secondary analysis was conducted from a trial with 864 smokers making quit attempt. Fagerstr\u00f6m Test of Cigarette Dependence (FTCD), Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI), and motivation to stop smoking (composite of determination to quit and importance of quitting) were measured at baseline. Continuous smoking abstinence, validated by expired-air carbon monoxide, was assessed at 4. weeks, 6. months and 12. months post-quit date. FTCD, HSI, non-HSI items in FTCD, and motivation were assessed as predictors of abstinence. Results: In multiple-logistic regressions, controlling for age, gender and medication use, lower scores for FTCD, HSI and non-HSI all significantly predicted abstinence at all follow-ups, while motivation did not predict abstinence at any time. Likelihood ratio tests showed that the FTCD contributed most to the model at 4. weeks and 6. months; at 12. months FTCD and non-HSI equally contributed most to the model. At 4. weeks and 6. months, predictions were improved by combining HSI and non-HSI components, compared with using these components alone. Conclusions: Cigarette dependence, measured by the FTCD, or by its HSI or non-HSI components, predicts both short-term and medium-term outcomes of attempts to stop smoking in treatment-seeking smokers involved in a clinical trial, whereas strength of motivation to stop predicts neither. Both the HSI and non-HSI components may be considered as briefer alternatives to the full FTCD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cigarette dependence", "Motivation", "Predictors", "Smoking cessation", "Trial"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motivation", "Patient Acceptance of Health Care", "Severity of Illness Index", "Smoking", "Smoking Cessation", "Tobacco Use Disorder", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946405896", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Toxicology", "PHAR", "3005"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"6603960588": {"Name": "Ussher M.", "AuthorID": "6603960588", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St. George's University of London"}, "56946875000": {"Name": "Kakar G.", "AuthorID": "56946875000", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St. George's University of London"}, "7102231308": {"Name": "Hajek P.", "AuthorID": "7102231308", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Academic Tobacco Dependence Research Unit, Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "7402396010": {"Name": "West R.", "AuthorID": "7402396010", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Health Behaviour Research Centre, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
