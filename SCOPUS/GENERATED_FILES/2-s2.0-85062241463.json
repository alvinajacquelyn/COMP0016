Insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), besides regulation of glucose homeostasis, also possess neurotrophic properties. Current study was aimed at investigating the influence of prenatal stress (PS) on insulin, GLP-1 and their receptor (IR and GLP-1R) levels in the hypothalamus. GLP-1 and GLP-1R were assayed also in the hippocampus and frontal cortex \u2013 brain regions mainly affected in depression. The second objective was to determine the influence of exendin-4 and insulin on CRH promoter gene activity in in vitro conditions. Methods: Adult male PS rats were subjected to acute stress and/or received orally glucose. Levels of hormones and their receptors were assayed with ELISA method. In vitro studies were performed on mHypoA-2/12 hypothalamic cell line, stably transfected with CRH promoter coupled with luciferase. Results: PS has reduced GLP-1 and GLP-1R levels, attenuated glucose-induced increase in insulin concentration and increased the amount of phosphorylated IR in the hypothalamus of animals subjected to additional stress stimuli, and also decreased the GLP-1R level in the hippocampus. In vitro studies demonstrated that insulin is capable of increasing CRH promoter activity in the condition of stimulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway in the applied cellular model. Conclusion: Prenatal stress may act as a preconditioning factor, affecting the concentrations of hormones such as insulin and GLP-1 in the hypothalamus in response to adverse stimuli. The decreased GLP-1R level in the hippocampus could be linked with the disturbances in neuronal plasticity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corticotropin-releasing hormone", "Depression", "Glucagon-like peptide-1", "Hypothalamus", "Insulin", "mHypoA-2/12"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cell Line", "Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone", "Depression", "Disease Models, Animal", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Exenatide", "Female", "Glucagon-Like Peptide 1", "Glucose", "Hypothalamus", "Insulin", "Male", "Mice", "Neuronal Plasticity", "Pregnancy", "Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Stress, Psychological"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062241463", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmacology", "PHAR", "3004"]], "AuthorData": {"55356757800": {"Name": "Detka J.", "AuthorID": "55356757800", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "55989384500": {"Name": "\u015alusarczyk J.", "AuthorID": "55989384500", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56363578400": {"Name": "Kurek A.", "AuthorID": "56363578400", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "56511468700": {"Name": "Kucharczyk M.", "AuthorID": "56511468700", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "7003610589": {"Name": "Kubera M.", "AuthorID": "7003610589", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "6603844877": {"Name": "Basta-Kaim A.", "AuthorID": "6603844877", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "7006226163": {"Name": "Laso\u0144 W.", "AuthorID": "7006226163", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "7003641200": {"Name": "Budziszewska B.", "AuthorID": "7003641200", "AffiliationID": "60000995, 60014383", "AffiliationName": "Department of Experimental Neuroendocrinology, Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences"}, "15729456400": {"Name": "Adamus T.", "AuthorID": "15729456400", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transplantation, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}, "56519776100": {"Name": "Konieczny P.", "AuthorID": "56519776100", "AffiliationID": "60021323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Transplantation, Jagiellonian University Medical College"}}}
