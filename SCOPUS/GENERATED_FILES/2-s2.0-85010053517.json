Morcellation can negatively influence the prognosis of patients, and transecting the specimen into pieces prevents the pathologist from performing proper disease staging. Many societies have published their statements regarding this issue. The European Society for Gynecological Oncology has established a working group of clinicians involved in diagnostics and treatment of oncogynecological patients to provide a statement from the oncological point of view. Leiomyosarcomas and undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas have generally dismal prognosis, whereas low-grade endometrial stromal sarcomas and adenosarcomas have variable prognosis based on their stage. A focus on the detection of patients at risk of having a sarcoma should be mandatory before every surgery where morcellation is planned by evaluation of risk factors (African American descent, previous pelvic irradiation, use of tamoxifen, rapid lesion growth particularly in postmenopausal patients) and exclusion of patients with any suspicious ultrasonographic signs. Preoperative endometrial biopsy should be mandatory, although the sensitivity to detect sarcomas is low. An indication for myomectomy should be used only in patients with pregnancy plans; otherwise en bloc hysterectomy is preferred in both symptomatic and postmenopausal patients. Eliminating the technique of morcellation could lead to an increased morbidity in low-risk patients; therefore, after thorough preoperative evaluation and discussion with patients, morcellation still has its place in the armamentarium of gynecologic surgery.", "AuthorKeywords": ["European Society of Gynecological Oncology", "Leiomyosarcoma", "Power morcellation", "Prognosis", "Statement", "Uterine sarcoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Leiomyoma", "Middle Aged", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Sarcoma", "Uterine Myomectomy", "Uterine Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010053517", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"7005747693": {"Name": "Halaska M.", "AuthorID": "7005747693", "AffiliationID": "60011227, 60016605", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, III Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague and Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady"}, "6602752603": {"Name": "Haidopoulos D.", "AuthorID": "6602752603", "AffiliationID": "60031258", "AffiliationName": "First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Alexandra Hospital"}, "56406996800": {"Name": "Guyon F.", "AuthorID": "56406996800", "AffiliationID": "60005766", "AffiliationName": "Chirurgie Gyn\u00e9cologique, Institut Bergonie"}, "35479744900": {"Name": "Morice P.", "AuthorID": "35479744900", "AffiliationID": "60027386", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Institute Gustave Roussy"}, "25222115300": {"Name": "Zapardiel I.", "AuthorID": "25222115300", "AffiliationID": "60028162", "AffiliationName": "Gynecologic Oncology Unit, La Paz University Hospital"}, "6701664626": {"Name": "Kesic V.", "AuthorID": "6701664626", "AffiliationID": "60069683", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Clinical Center of Serbia"}, "7006225985": {"Name": "Cibula D.", "AuthorID": "7006225985", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7102704380": {"Name": "Querleu D.", "AuthorID": "7102704380", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6701502096": {"Name": "Gultekin M.", "AuthorID": "6701502096", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6701531876": {"Name": "Creutzberg C.", "AuthorID": "6701531876", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6603975050": {"Name": "Avall-Lundqvist E.", "AuthorID": "6603975050", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7004512023": {"Name": "Goffin F.", "AuthorID": "7004512023", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6603208686": {"Name": "Concin N.", "AuthorID": "6603208686", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55237699800": {"Name": "Ferrero A.", "AuthorID": "55237699800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57193014463": {"Name": "Kurdiani D.", "AuthorID": "57193014463", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7007134127": {"Name": "Ledermann J.", "AuthorID": "7007134127", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7102700251": {"Name": "Ponce J.", "AuthorID": "7102700251", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "56250953800": {"Name": "Sessa C.", "AuthorID": "56250953800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6603406159": {"Name": "Wimberger P.", "AuthorID": "6603406159", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7005288143": {"Name": "Marth C.", "AuthorID": "7005288143", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55026663800": {"Name": "Laky R.", "AuthorID": "55026663800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
