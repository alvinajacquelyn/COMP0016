Longitudinal data on objectively measured PA data can give insights about how PA and SB change with age. METHODS: Men age 70-90 yr, from a United Kingdom population-based cohort wore a GT3X accelerometer over the hip annually on up to three occasions (56%, 50%, and 51% response rates) spanning 2 yr. Multilevel models were used to estimate change in activity. Men were grouped according to achieving \u2265150 min\u00b7wk of MVPA in bouts of \u226510 min (current guidelines) at two or three time points. RESULTS: A total of 1419 ambulatory men had \u2265600 min wear time on \u22653 d at \u22652 time points. At baseline, men took 4806 steps per day and spent 72.5% of their day in SB, 23.1% in light PA, and 4.1% in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Mean change per year was -341 steps, +1.1% SB, -0.7% light PA, and -0.4% MVPA each day (all P < 0.001). A total of 76.3% (n = 1083) never met guidelines (\"stable low\"), 7.9% (n = 112) consistently met guidelines (\"stable high\"), 8.2% (n = 116) stopped meeting guidelines by the last occasion (\"decreasers\"), and 4.9% (n = 69) started meeting guidelines by the last occasion (\"increasers\"). \"Decreasers\" spent 69.3% of each day in SB at baseline, which increased by 2% per year (P < 0.005), light activity remained at 23.3% (change, -0.2% per year; P = 0.4), and total MVPA decreased from 7.1% by -1.7% per year, (P < 0.001). The number of sedentary bouts >30 min increased from 5.1 by 0.1 per year (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Among older adults, the steep decline in total PA occurred because of reductions in MVPA, while light PA is relatively spared and sedentary time and long sedentary bouts increase.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Accelerometer", "Cohort Study", "Older Adults", "Physical Activity", "Sedentary Behavior"], "IndexKeywords": ["Accelerometry", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Motor Activity", "Sedentary Lifestyle", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922013127", "SubjectAreas": [["Orthopedics and Sports Medicine", "MEDI", "2732"], ["Physical Therapy, Sports Therapy and Rehabilitation", "HEAL", "3612"]], "AuthorData": {"6507251154": {"Name": "Jefferis B.J.", "AuthorID": "6507251154", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Physical Activity Research Group, University College London"}, "55811454000": {"Name": "Sartini C.", "AuthorID": "55811454000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Medical School"}, "56124564300": {"Name": "Ash S.", "AuthorID": "56124564300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Medical School"}, "6603033975": {"Name": "Lennon L.T.", "AuthorID": "6603033975", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Medical School"}, "7006543768": {"Name": "Wannamethee S.G.", "AuthorID": "7006543768", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London, Medical School"}, "7404437968": {"Name": "Lee I.M.", "AuthorID": "7404437968", "AffiliationID": "60016782, 60002746", "AffiliationName": "Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}, "7006237290": {"Name": "Whincup P.H.", "AuthorID": "7006237290", "AffiliationID": "60029329", "AffiliationName": "Population Health Research Institute, St. George's University of London"}}}
