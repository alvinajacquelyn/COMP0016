Here, we examine whether transferred donor natural regulatory CD4 T cells (nT-regs) inhibit host alloimmunity and prolong allograft survival. Transfer of donor-strain lymphocytes was first assessed by identifying circulating donor-derived CD4 T cells in 21 consecutive human lung transplant recipients, with 3 patterns of chimerism apparent: transient, intermediate, and persistent (detectable for up to 6 weeks, 6 months, and beyond 1 year, respectively). The potential for transfer of donor nT-regs was then confirmed by analysis of leukocyte filters recovered from ex vivo normothermic perfusion circuits of human kidneys retrieved for transplantation. Finally, in a murine model of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, depletion of donor CD4 nT-regs before organ recovery resulted in markedly accelerated heart allograft rejection and augmented host effector antibody responses. Conversely, adoptive transfer or purified donor-strain nT-regs inhibited host humoral immunity and prolonged allograft survival, and more effectively so than following administration of recipient nT-regs. In summary, following transplantation, passenger donor-strain nT-regs can inhibit host adaptive immune responses and prolong allograft survival. Isolated donor-derived nT-regs may hold potential as a cellular therapy to improve transplant outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["basic (laboratory) research/science", "cellular biology", "immune regulation", "immunobiology", "lymphocyte biology", "organ transplantation in general", "T cell biology", "tolerance: experimental", "tolerance: mechanisms", "translational research/science"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adoptive Transfer", "Allografts", "Animals", "Cell Lineage", "Graft Rejection", "Graft Survival", "Heart Transplantation", "Humans", "Immune System", "Immunity, Humoral", "Isoantibodies", "Kidney Transplantation", "Lung Transplantation", "Mice", "Organ Preservation", "Perfusion", "T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory", "Tissue Donors", "Transplantation, Homologous", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061057325", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Transplantation", "MEDI", "2747"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"37761480700": {"Name": "Harper I.G.", "AuthorID": "37761480700", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "53979600600": {"Name": "Gjorgjimajkoska O.", "AuthorID": "53979600600", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57203961034": {"Name": "Siu J.H.Y.", "AuthorID": "57203961034", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "6603294719": {"Name": "Hosgood S.A.", "AuthorID": "6603294719", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "35448853600": {"Name": "Nicholson M.L.", "AuthorID": "35448853600", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "7005604033": {"Name": "Pettigrew G.J.", "AuthorID": "7005604033", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "36603203500": {"Name": "Parmar J.", "AuthorID": "36603203500", "AffiliationID": "60033313", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiothoracic Transplantation, Papworth Hospital"}, "7102350971": {"Name": "Mulder A.", "AuthorID": "7102350971", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunohaematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "36039110300": {"Name": "Claas F.H.J.", "AuthorID": "36039110300", "AffiliationID": "60015618", "AffiliationName": "Department of Immunohaematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center"}, "6507494664": {"Name": "Motallebzadeh R.", "AuthorID": "6507494664", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London"}}}
