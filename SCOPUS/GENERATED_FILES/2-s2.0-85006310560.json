Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).This paper considers the neglected mobilities associated with a sample of UK women reported as missing. Refracted through literatures on gendered mobility and abandonment, the paper argues that the journeys of these women in crisis are not well understood by police services, and that normative gender relations may infuse their management. By selectively exploring one illustrative police case file on Kim, we highlight how reported and observed socio-spatial relationships within private and public spaces relate to search actions. We argue that Kim's mobility and spatial experiences are barely understood, except for when they appear to symbolise disorder and danger. We address the silences in this singular case by using the voices of other women reported as missing, as collected in a research project to explore the agency, experience and meaning of female mobility during absence. We argue that women reported as missing are not abandoned by UK policing services, but that a policy of continued search for them may be at risk if they repeatedly contravene normative socio-spatial relationships through regular absence mobilities. By way of conclusion, we address recent calls for research that explores the relationships between gender and mobility.", "AuthorKeywords": ["abandonment", "absence", "missing women", "mobility", "narrative", "policing"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006310560", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"36785569300": {"Name": "Stevenson O.", "AuthorID": "36785569300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Office of the Vice Provost Research, University College London"}, "6603906892": {"Name": "Parr H.", "AuthorID": "6603906892", "AffiliationID": "60001490", "AffiliationName": "Geographical and Earth Science, University of Glasgow"}, "56020579200": {"Name": "Woolnough P.", "AuthorID": "56020579200", "AffiliationID": "60001903", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology, School of Social and Health Sciences, University of Abertay"}}}
