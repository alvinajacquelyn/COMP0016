The aim of this study was to relate the adherence to MD with the incidence of cardio/cerebro-vascular events (VEs) in north and south European participants of the IMPROVE study. Methods: IMPROVE is an observational, longitudinal, prospective cohort study involving 3703 individuals from five European countries (Finland, Sweden, Netherlands, France and Italy). The study end-point was the incidence of the first combined cardio/cerebro-vascular event occurring during 36-months follow-up. At baseline, a dietary questionnaire about the usual intake during the year preceding enrollment was administered. Based on 7 nutritional items, a MD Score was constructed in which minimal adherence was 0 and maximal adherence was 7. Results: Latitude was the strongest determinant of MD score (p < 0.001). VEs occurred in 215 participants. The incidence of VEs was the highest in subjects with MD score 0\u20131, lower in those with score 2\u20133 and the lowest in those with score \u2265 4. MD score remained significantly associated with subsequent VEs after adjustment for confounders (hazard ratio for one-point increment of the score = 0.75, p < 0.001) and the association was stronger in northern than in southern countries (p = 0.04 for MD Score \u00d7 latitude interaction). Conclusions: The MD adherence score based on a simple dietary questionnaire detects changes of risk of VEs. According to our findings north Europeans appear to benefit most from VE-prevention when their diet is altered to the MD diet.", "AuthorKeywords": ["IMPROVE study", "Mediterranean diet score", "Vascular diseases"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cohort Studies", "Diet, Healthy", "Diet, Mediterranean", "Europe", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Mediterranean Region", "Middle Aged", "Predictive Value of Tests", "Prospective Studies"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057987874", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"21136513100": {"Name": "Veglia F.", "AuthorID": "21136513100", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "6701322321": {"Name": "Baldassarre D.", "AuthorID": "6701322321", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Biotechnology and Translational Medicine, Universit\u00e0 di Milano"}, "7103061528": {"Name": "Amato M.", "AuthorID": "7103061528", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "55461048400": {"Name": "Di Minno A.", "AuthorID": "55461048400", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "22235372100": {"Name": "Ravani A.", "AuthorID": "22235372100", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "23485126900": {"Name": "Frigerio B.", "AuthorID": "23485126900", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "44061868800": {"Name": "Sansaro D.", "AuthorID": "44061868800", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "56452656400": {"Name": "Bonomi A.", "AuthorID": "56452656400", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "25222107400": {"Name": "Tedesco C.C.", "AuthorID": "25222107400", "AffiliationID": "60073816", "AffiliationName": "Centro Cardiologico Monzino, IRCCS"}, "7006057885": {"Name": "Tremoli E.", "AuthorID": "7006057885", "AffiliationID": "60030318", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche e Biomolecolari, Universit\u00e0 di Milano"}, "7103145439": {"Name": "de Faire U.", "AuthorID": "7103145439", "AffiliationID": "60019295, 60012311", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, Karolinska Institutet"}, "13605651400": {"Name": "Kurl S.", "AuthorID": "13605651400", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland"}, "7103114601": {"Name": "Smit A.J.", "AuthorID": "7103114601", "AffiliationID": "60006027", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen"}, "7006315020": {"Name": "Rauramaa R.", "AuthorID": "7006315020", "AffiliationID": "60103673", "AffiliationName": "Foundation for Research in Health Exercise and Nutrition, Kuopio Research Institute of Exercise Medicine"}, "7006482932": {"Name": "Giral P.", "AuthorID": "7006482932", "AffiliationID": "60021567, 60015622", "AffiliationName": "Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris, Service Endocrinologie-Metabolisme, Groupe H\u00f4pitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Unit\u00e9s de Pr\u00e9vention Cardiovasculaire"}, "6505944294": {"Name": "Castelnuovo S.", "AuthorID": "6505944294", "AffiliationID": "60015852", "AffiliationName": "Centro Dislipidemie E.
