While phantom sensations can be innocuous, they are often manifested as painful. Phantom limb pain (PLP) is notorious for being difficult to monitor and treat. A major challenge in PLP management is the difficulty in assessing PLP symptoms, given the physical absence of the affected body part. Here, we offer a means of quantifying chronic PLP by harnessing the known ability of amputees to voluntarily move their phantom limbs. Upper-limb amputees suffering from chronic PLP performed a simple finger-tapping task with their phantom hand. We confirm that amputees suffering from worse chronic PLP had worse motor control over their phantom hand. We further demonstrate that task performance was consistent over weeks and did not relate to transient PLP or non-painful phantom sensations. Finally, we explore the neural basis of these behavioural correlates of PLP. Using neuroimaging, we reveal that slower phantom hand movements were coupled with stronger activity in the primary sensorimotor phantom hand cortex, previously shown to associate with chronic PLP. By demonstrating a specific link between phantom hand motor control and chronic PLP, our findings open up new avenues for PLP management and improvement of existing PLP treatments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amputees", "Body representation", "Neuroimaging", "Phantom limb pain", "Plasticity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Amputees", "Female", "Fingers", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Motor Cortex", "Phantom Limb", "Psychomotor Performance", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027530973", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56584336200": {"Name": "Kikkert S.", "AuthorID": "56584336200", "AffiliationID": "60016529", "AffiliationName": "Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen"}, "55798341500": {"Name": "Mezue M.", "AuthorID": "55798341500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "6701480981": {"Name": "Johansen-Berg H.", "AuthorID": "6701480981", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "FMRIB Centre, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Oxford"}, "57191026623": {"Name": "Tracey I.", "AuthorID": "57191026623", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Division of Anaesthetics, University of Oxford"}, "15835219200": {"Name": "Makin T.R.", "AuthorID": "15835219200", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London"}, "24461774900": {"Name": "Henderson Slater D.", "AuthorID": "24461774900", "AffiliationID": "60115285, 60170322", "AffiliationName": "Oxford Centre for Enablement, Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre"}}}
