Previous neuroimaging studies have provided indirect evidence that the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 hippocampal subregions support pattern separation by inferring the nature of underlying representations from the observation of novelty signals. Here, we use ultra-high-resolution fMRI at 7 T and multivariate pattern analysis to provide compelling evidence that the DG subregion specifically sustains representations of similar scenes that are less overlapping than in other hippocampal (e.g.,CA3) and medial temporal lobe regions (e.g.,entorhinal cortex). Further, we provide evidence that novelty signals within the DG are stimulus specific rather than generic in nature. Our study, in providing a mechanistic link between novelty signals and the underlying representations, constitutes the first demonstration that the human DG performs pattern separation.", "AuthorKeywords": ["7 T fMRI", "Hippocampal subfields", "Medial temporal lobe", "Memory", "MVPA", "Pattern separation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Brain Mapping", "Dentate Gyrus", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Oxygen", "Pattern Recognition, Visual", "Photic Stimulation", "Recognition (Psychology)", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84978657131", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"56525318400": {"Name": "Berron D.", "AuthorID": "56525318400", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "23005990900": {"Name": "Sch\u00fctze H.", "AuthorID": "23005990900", "AffiliationID": "60018362", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Cognitive Neurology and Dementia Research, Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg"}, "56425646600": {"Name": "Maass A.", "AuthorID": "56425646600", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "6701771740": {"Name": "D\u00fczel E.", "AuthorID": "6701771740", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}, "6508147821": {"Name": "Cardenas-Blanco A.", "AuthorID": "6508147821", "AffiliationID": "60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases"}, "53463874800": {"Name": "Kuijf H.", "AuthorID": "53463874800", "AffiliationID": "60012273, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "8650774800": {"Name": "Kumaran D.", "AuthorID": "8650774800", "AffiliationID": "60109771, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience"}}}
