This simplification results in a substantially reduced computational cost which is very useful in real-time blood flow simulations, in particular for large vasculatures containing thousands of blood vessels. By incorporating a convection equation we can also simulate transient drug transportation in the vasculature. In this paper we present at first the implementation of a real-time flow solver which is coupled with a complex arterial tree generated from the Constrained Constructive Optimisation (CCO) algorithm. The computational time for ~ 8200 vessels was 0.2s. Secondly, we simulate the transient drug transportation in the vasculature. Thirdly, we model the delivery of the drug into a tiny tissue block by adopting a 3D diffusion equation. In conclusion the presented computational techniques constitute a pipeline for circulation modelling in multiple scales, and may be used in a variety of biomedical applications.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Blood", "Drug delivery", "Flow solver", "Real-time solver"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomedical applications", "Blood flow simulations", "Computational costs", "Computational simulation", "Computational technique", "Drug transportations", "Flow solver", "Real time"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017051361", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"57193842118": {"Name": "Coutey C.", "AuthorID": "57193842118", "AffiliationID": "60028112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics, ENSEEIHT"}, "57213638046": {"Name": "Berg M.", "AuthorID": "57213638046", "AffiliationID": "60028112", "AffiliationName": "Department of Fluid Mechanics and Hydraulics, ENSEEIHT"}, "35210042000": {"Name": "Ho H.", "AuthorID": "35210042000", "AffiliationID": "60112777, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland"}, "7201422778": {"Name": "Hunter P.", "AuthorID": "7201422778", "AffiliationID": "60112777, 60005686", "AffiliationName": "Auckland Bioengineering Institute, University of Auckland"}}}
