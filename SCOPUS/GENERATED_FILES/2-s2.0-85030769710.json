Methods: The present study included 132 autopsy cases with rapidly progressive neurological syndromes, including Alzheimer disease (AD) (21), sporadic (65) and genetic (21) Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD), 25 cases with vascular, neoplastic and inflammatory alterations, and additionally 18 healthy control individuals. CSF tau and NF-L concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Plasma tau and NF-L concentrations were measured using ultra-sensitive single molecule array technology. Results: Plasma and CSF tau (R = 0.59, P < 0.001) and NF-L (R = 0.69, P < 0.001) levels correlated significantly (Spearman test). Plasma tau and NF-L levels were significantly higher in all disease groups compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used and area under the curve values for comparisons with controls were 0.82 (AD), 0.94 (sporadic CJD), 0.92 (genetic CJD) and 0.83 (other neurological disorders) for plasma tau and 0.99, 0.99, 1.00 and 0.96 for plasma NF-L, respectively. Molecular subtyping of sporadic CJD showed a strong effect (linear logistic regression) on plasma tau (P < 0.001) but not NF-L levels (P = 0.19). Conclusion: Plasma tau and NF-L concentrations are strongly increased in CJD and show similar diagnostic performance to the corresponding CSF measure. Molecular subtypes of sporadic CJD show different levels of plasma tau. Although not disease-specific, these findings support the use of plasma tau and NF-L as tools to identify, or to rule out, neurodegeneration.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer disease", "Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease", "neurodegeneration", "neurofilament light chain", "rapidly progressive neurological syndrome", "tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Biomarkers", "Cohort Studies", "Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay", "Female", "Humans", "Intermediate Filaments", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neurodegenerative Diseases", "tau Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030769710", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"26428262100": {"Name": "Kovacs G.G.", "AuthorID": "26428262100", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Prion Disease and Neuropathology Reference Center, Semmelweis University"}, "57213056247": {"Name": "Regelsberger G.", "AuthorID": "57213056247", "AffiliationID": "60018333, 60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56009893400": {"Name": "Lutz M.I.", "AuthorID": "56009893400", "AffiliationID": "60018333, 60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57194158596": {"Name": "Danics K.", "AuthorID": "57194158596", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic and Insurance Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "7202812536": {"Name": "Keller E.", "AuthorID": "7202812536", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic and Insurance Medicine, Semmelweis University"}, "6507790467": {"Name": "Andreasson U.", "AuthorID": "6507790467", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}, "56601439500": {"Name": "Liman V.", "AuthorID": "56601439500", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60027675, 60016437", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg"}}}
