Assuming that the number of factors used in estimation is larger than the true number of factors in the data, we establish the limiting distribution of the LS estimator for the regression coefficients as the number of time periods and the number of cross-sectional units jointly go to infinity. The main result of the paper is that under certain assumptions, the limiting distribution of the LS estimator is independent of the number of factors used in the estimation as long as this number is not underestimated. The important practical implication of this result is that for inference on the regression coefficients, one does not necessarily need to estimate the number of interactive fixed effects consistently.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Factor models", "Interactive fixed effects", "Panel data", "Perturbation theory of linear operators", "Random matrix theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938149024", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"]], "AuthorData": {"7402662461": {"Name": "Moon H.", "AuthorID": "7402662461", "AffiliationID": "60016912", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Economics, Yonsei University"}, "55241495000": {"Name": "Weidner M.", "AuthorID": "55241495000", "AffiliationID": "60117041", "AffiliationName": "CeMMaP"}}}
