Methods: Two female patients (four eyes) with a diagnosis of AMNR were observed at the Clinical Investigation Center, CHNO des Quinze-Vingts, Paris, France. The patients underwent detailed ophthalmic examination including best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, kinetic and static perimetry, full-field and multifocal electroretinogram, infrared reflectance, autofluorescence imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and AO fundus imaging at presentation and during follow-up. Results: Both cases showed concomitant loss of integrity of the outer retinal structures on SD-OCT, and marked abnormalities on AO imaging with disruption of the visibility of the cone mosaic. In the first case, photoreceptor damage was seen to progress during several weeks before healing. In both cases, there were persistent morphological abnormalities of photoreceptors 1 year after onset. Conclusion: This study further highlights the value of AO fundus imaging to facilitate detection, mapping, and monitoring of damage to the cone outer segments during AMNR. In particular, residual damage to the cone mosaic can be precisely documented.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acute macular neuroretinopathy", "Adaptive optics", "High-resolution retinal imaging", "Multimodal retinal imaging", "SD-OCT"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Adolescent", "Diagnostic Imaging", "Electroretinography", "Female", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Humans", "Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate", "Retinal Diseases", "Scotoma", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Visual Acuity", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940929185", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"6507690222": {"Name": "Audo I.", "AuthorID": "6507690222", "AffiliationID": "60004689", "AffiliationName": "D\u00e9partement de G\u00e9n\u00e9tique, Curie/CHNO des Quinze-Vingts, Centre de Recherche Institut de la Vision, UMR S 968 Inserm / Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie"}, "6602623420": {"Name": "Gocho K.", "AuthorID": "6602623420", "AffiliationID": "60018600, 60031270", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology, Nippon Medical University, Chiba Hokusoh Hospital"}, "57204254747": {"Name": "Mohand-Sa\u00efd S.", "AuthorID": "57204254747", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}, "7101991490": {"Name": "Sahel J.A.", "AuthorID": "7101991490", "AffiliationID": "112639629", "AffiliationName": "Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences-Institut de France"}, "7005188041": {"Name": "Paques M.", "AuthorID": "7005188041", "AffiliationID": "60008134", "AffiliationName": "CNRS, UMR_7210"}, "8430664100": {"Name": "Rossant F.", "AuthorID": "8430664100", "AffiliationID": "100354212", "AffiliationName": "Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d\u2019Electronique de Paris"}, "7006719501": {"Name": "Bloch I.", "AuthorID": "7006719501", "AffiliationID": "60072950, 60029116", "AffiliationName": "Telecom Paris Tech, CNRS LTCI"}, "23493222000": {"Name": "Loquin K.", "AuthorID": "23493222000", "AffiliationID": "60031184", "AffiliationName": "Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild"}}}
