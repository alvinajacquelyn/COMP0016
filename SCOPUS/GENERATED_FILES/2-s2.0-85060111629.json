Methods: Experimental periodontitis was induced in 6 male Sprague-Dawley rats. Alveolar bone loss was measure by micro computed tomography. Serum concentrations of A\u03b2 1\u201340 and A\u03b2 1\u201342 prior to periodontal induction, at 24 h, 7, 14, and 21 days the last injection of Pg-LPS. Results: The distance between the cemento-enamel junction and the bone crest (i.e., alveolar bone loss) was significantly higher at the end of periodontal induction compared to baseline (2.92 \u00b1 0.29 mm vs. 3.8 \u00b1 0.28 mm, P < 0.001). Periodontitis evoked a slight acute elevation of A\u03b2 1\u201340 serum levels that were maintained during the whole experiment. A\u03b2 1\u201342 peptide levels peak at the end of the study. A positive strong correlation was observed between alveolar bone loss and A\u03b2 1\u201340 serum levels at 7 days (r = 0.695, P = 0.012) and as well as with serum A\u03b2 1\u201342 concentrations at 21 days (r = 0.968, P = 0.002). Conclusions: Periodontitis induced Pg-LPS produced increased serum levels of A\u03b2 peptides. Further studies are needed to confirm our results and to investigate the mechanisms by which periodontitis could be associated with an overexpression of A\u03b2.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amyloid-beta peptides", "Cognitive decline", "Endothelial dysfunction", "Lipopolysaccharide", "Periodontitis", "Porphyromonas gingivalis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Alveolar Bone Loss", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Cognitive Dysfunction", "Disease Models, Animal", "Lipopolysaccharides", "Male", "Peptide Fragments", "Periodontitis", "Porphyromonas gingivalis", "Rats", "Rats, Sprague-Dawley", "Time Factors", "Tooth Cervix", "X-Ray Microtomography"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060111629", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56707470700": {"Name": "Leira Y.", "AuthorID": "56707470700", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute and Hospital, University College London"}, "57061663300": {"Name": "Blanco J.", "AuthorID": "57061663300", "AffiliationID": "60019316, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of Santiago de Compostela, Medical-Surgical Dentistry (OMEQUI) Research Group, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "6507515725": {"Name": "D'Aiuto F.", "AuthorID": "6507515725", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60013985", "AffiliationName": "Periodontology Unit, UCL Eastman Dental Institute and Hospital, University College London"}, "57190743110": {"Name": "Iglesias-Rey R.", "AuthorID": "57190743110", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Clinical University Hospital, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "14618933700": {"Name": "Campos F.", "AuthorID": "14618933700", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Clinical University Hospital, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "55766041200": {"Name": "Castillo J.", "AuthorID": "55766041200", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Clinical University Hospital, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "12769820300": {"Name": "Sobrino T.", "AuthorID": "12769820300", "AffiliationID": "60002983", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurosciences Research Laboratory, Clinical University Hospital, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "57193345387": {"Name": "G\u00f3mez-Lado N.", "AuthorID": "57193345387", "AffiliationID": "60002983, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Imaging Group, Clinical University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}, "8531886300": {"Name": "Aguiar P.", "AuthorID": "8531886300", "AffiliationID": "60002983, 60028419", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Imaging Group, Clinical University Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Santiago de Compostela, Health Research Institute of Santiago de Compostela (IDIS)"}}}
