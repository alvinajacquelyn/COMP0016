Karger AG, Basel. Copyright: All rights reserved.The selective \u03b12-adrenoreceptor agonist dexmedetomidine has shown neuroprotective, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and sympatholytic properties that may be beneficial in neonatal encephalopathy (NE). As therapeutic hypothermia is only partially effective, adjunct therapies are needed to optimize outcomes. The aim was to assess whether hypothermia + dexmedetomidine treatment augments neuroprotection compared to routine treatment (hypothermia + fentanyl sedation) in a piglet model of NE using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) biomarkers, which predict outcomes in babies with NE, and immunohistochemistry. After hypoxia-ischaemia (HI), 20 large White male piglets were randomized to: (i) hypothermia + fentanyl with cooling to 33.5\u00b0C from 2 to 26 h, or (ii) hypothermia + dexmedetomidine (a loading dose of 2 \u03bcg/kg at 10 min followed by 0.028 \u03bcg/kg/h for 48 h). Whole-brain phosphorus-31 and regional proton MRS biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 24, and 48 h after HI. At 48 h, cell death was evaluated over 7 brain regions by means of transferase-mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Dexmedetomidine plasma levels were mainly within the target sedative range of 1 \u03bcg/L. In the hypothermia + dexmedetomidine group, there were 6 cardiac arrests (3 fatal) versus 2 (non-fatal) in the hypothermia + fentanyl group. The hypothermia + dexmedetomidine group required more saline (p = 0.005) to maintain blood pressure. Thalamic and white-matter lactate/N-acetylaspartate did not differ between groups (p = 0.66 and p = 0.21, respectively); the whole-brain nucleotide triphosphate/exchangeable phosphate pool was similar (p = 0.73) over 48 h. Cell death (TUNEL-positive cells/mm2) was higher in the hypothermia + dexmedetomidine group than in the hypothermia + fentanyl group (mean 5.1 vs. 2.3, difference 2.8 [95% CI 0.6-4.9], p = 0.036). Hypothermia + dexmedetomidine treatment was associated with adverse cardiovascular events, even within the recommended clinical sedative plasma level; these may have been exacerbated by an interaction with either isoflurane or low body temperature. Hypothermia + dexmedetomidine treatment was neurotoxic following HI in our piglet NE model, suggesting that caution is vital if dexmedetomidine is combined with cooling following NE.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dexmedetomidine", "Hypothermia", "Magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "Neonatal encephalopathy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Animals, Newborn", "Asphyxia Neonatorum", "Cardiovascular System", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Dexmedetomidine", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain", "Male", "Neuroprotective Agents", "Random Allocation", "Swine"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018510298", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"]], "AuthorData": {"55812285300": {"Name": "Ezzati M.", "AuthorID": "55812285300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "56123701700": {"Name": "Kawano G.", "AuthorID": "56123701700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55110477100": {"Name": "Rocha-Ferreira E.", "AuthorID": "55110477100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "35085901300": {"Name": "Alonso-Alconada D.", "AuthorID": "35085901300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55755688000": {"Name": "Hassell J.K.", "AuthorID": "55755688000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7003578598": {"Name": "Broad K.D.", "AuthorID": "7003578598", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "55318034900": {"Name": "Fierens I.", "AuthorID": "55318034900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "22937760400": {"Name": "Hristova M.", "AuthorID": "22937760400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7102941268": {"Name": "Robertson N.J.", "AuthorID": "7102941268", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EGA Institute for Women's Health, University College London"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, University College London"}, "57191341272": {"Name": "Kaynezhad P.", "AuthorID": "57191341272", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "6507301690": {"Name": "Tachtsidis I.", "AuthorID": "6507301690", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics and Bioengineering, University College London"}, "35784226800": {"Name": "Fleiss B.", "AuthorID": "35784226800", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM"}, "57203054731": {"Name": "Gressens P.", "AuthorID": "57203054731", "AffiliationID": "60000905", "AffiliationName": "INSERM"}, "8576309800": {"Name": "Bainbridge A.", "AuthorID": "8576309800", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "57207078497": {"Name": "Price D.L.", "AuthorID": "57207078497", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Medical Physics, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust"}, "7404263321": {"Name": "Anderson B.", "AuthorID": "7404263321", "AffiliationID": "60005686", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology, University of Auckland"}, "57203045001": {"Name": "Sanders R.D.", "AuthorID": "57203045001", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "University of Wisconsin"}}}
