The discrepancies and inter-linking paths of demand-driven energy uses via domestic supply chains have been identified. The total embodied energy uses (EEUs) in final demand amount to 3318.69 Mtce, of which investment contributes 45.97% to the total. All manufacturing sectors account for 45.75% of the total EEUs, followed by construction for 29.43% and services for 13.69%. By tracing embodied energy fluxes starting from resource extraction to final uses, several critical industrial sectors and crucial routes starting from resource extraction to final use are extracted and ranked. To develop more appropriate policy designs for energy saving and emission reduction in China, demand-driven embodied energy uses deserve to be considered from a systematic viewpoint.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chinese economy", "Domestic supply chains", "Embodied energy", "Input-output model", "Structural path analysis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chinese economy", "Domestic supplies", "Embodied energy", "Input output model", "Path analysis"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020725262", "SubjectAreas": [["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"57193226192": {"Name": "Qu X.", "AuthorID": "57193226192", "AffiliationID": "60108755", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)"}, "57188923500": {"Name": "Sun X.", "AuthorID": "57188923500", "AffiliationID": "60108755", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)"}, "56984658300": {"Name": "Zhang B.", "AuthorID": "56984658300", "AffiliationID": "60108755", "AffiliationName": "School of Management, China University of Mining and Technology (Beijing)"}, "55975044300": {"Name": "Meng J.", "AuthorID": "55975044300", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "College of Urban and Environmental Sciences, Peking University"}}}
