Multidisciplinary pain management programs are designed to provide patients with the skills to improve, maintain functioning and self-manage their pain but gains diminish in the long-term due to lack of support from clinicians. Sensing technology can be a cost-effective way to extend support for self-management outside clinical settings but they are currently under-explored. In this paper, we report studies carried out to investigate how Personal Informatics Systems (PIS) based on wearable body sensing technology could facilitate pain self-management and functioning. Five roles for PIS emerged from a qualitative study with people with chronic pain and physiotherapists: (i) assessment, planning and prevention (ii) a direct supervisory and co-management role, (iii) facilitating deeper understanding, (iv) managing emotional states, and (v) sharing for social acceptability. A web-based survey was conducted to understand the parameters that should be tracked to support self-management and what tracked information should be shared with others. Finally, we suggest an extension to previous PIS models and propose design implications to address immediate, short-term and long-term information needs for personal use of people with chronic pain and for sharing with others.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chronic pain", "emotional wellbeing", "personal informatics", "physiological sensing", "quantified-self", "self-management", "wearables"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chronic pain", "Emotional wellbeing", "Personal informatics", "Physiological sensing", "quantified-self", "Self management", "wearables"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963754370", "SubjectAreas": [["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"]], "AuthorData": {"57188838193": {"Name": "Felipe S.", "AuthorID": "57188838193", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College"}, "57199212151": {"Name": "Singh A.", "AuthorID": "57199212151", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College"}, "57188842599": {"Name": "Bradley C.", "AuthorID": "57188842599", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College"}, "23007289500": {"Name": "Williams A.", "AuthorID": "23007289500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College"}, "6602671345": {"Name": "Bianchi-Berthouze N.", "AuthorID": "6602671345", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCLIC, University College"}}}
