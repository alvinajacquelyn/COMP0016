Published by Elsevier B.V.Background: Several aspects of school life are thought to be associated with increased risk of self-harm in adolescence, but these have rarely been investigated in prospective studies. Methods: Members of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) birth cohort completed postal surveys of school experiences aged 14, and self-harm behaviour aged 16 (n=3939). Associations between school experiences (feeling connected to school, enjoyment of school and perception of teachers as fair) and subsequent self-harm were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Self-harm aged 16 was associated with earlier perceptions of school, specifically not getting on well with or feeling accepted by others (OR=2.43 [1.76, 3.35] and OR=2.69 [2.16, 3.35] respectively), not liking school or the work done in class (OR=1.40 [1.17, 1.69] and OR=1.36 [1.10, 1.67]), and feeling that teachers are not clear about behaviour or fail to address misbehaviour consistently (OR=1.59 [1.20, 2.12] OR=1.89 [1.51, 2.37]). These associations were partially attenuated in models controlling for mental health concurrent with the outcome. Poor school experiences were related to both suicidal and non-suicidal self-harm, with slightly stronger associations visible for the former. Limitations: (i) There was some loss to follow up, (ii) experience of bullying was not measured, and (iii) exposure and outcome measures were self-report. Conclusions: Students who feel unconnected to school, unhappy at school, or feel that teachers are unfair are more likely to self-harm in the future. Assessing students' perceptions of schoolmay serve to identify those at risk of self-harm who would benefit from preventative interventions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "ALSPAC", "School risk factors", "Self-harm"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Bullying", "England", "Female", "Happiness", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Prospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Schools", "Self Report", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Social Environment", "Students", "Suicidal Ideation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84911999411", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"8841757200": {"Name": "Kidger J.", "AuthorID": "8841757200", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "7006836112": {"Name": "Heron J.", "AuthorID": "7006836112", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "7004134399": {"Name": "Tilling K.", "AuthorID": "7004134399", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "7006194937": {"Name": "Gunnell D.", "AuthorID": "7006194937", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "School of Social and Community Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall"}, "20434253200": {"Name": "Leon D.A.", "AuthorID": "20434253200", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7402636617": {"Name": "Lewis G.", "AuthorID": "7402636617", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}}}
