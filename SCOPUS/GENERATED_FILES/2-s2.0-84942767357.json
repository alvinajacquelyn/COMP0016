Results: A total of 32.2% of children (self-report) and 15.2% of children (parent-report) scored \u2265 1 SD above the mean on the SCAS total score. The subscales where most difficulty were reported on parent-report were Physical Injury and Separation Anxiety. There was less variation on self-report. On the CDI, 20.9% of young people scored \u2265 1 SD above the mean. Children reported significantly more symptoms of anxiety on the SCAS total score and three of the subscales (p < .05). There was a significant effect on the SCAS total score of respondents by seizure type interaction, suggesting higher scores on SCAS for children with generalized seizures on self- but not parent-report. Higher CDI scores were significantly associated with generalized seizures (p > .05). Summary: Symptoms of anxiety were more common based on self-report compared with parent-report. Children with generalized seizures reported more symptoms of depression and anxiety.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Anxiety", "Children", "Depression", "Epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anticonvulsants", "Anxiety", "Anxiety, Separation", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Depression", "Epilepsy", "Epilepsy, Generalized", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Parents", "Population", "Psychiatric Status Rating Scales", "Self Report"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84942767357", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"26634364600": {"Name": "Reilly C.", "AuthorID": "26634364600", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg"}, "7402223872": {"Name": "Das K.B.", "AuthorID": "7402223872", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health University College London"}, "6507002035": {"Name": "Burch V.", "AuthorID": "6507002035", "AffiliationID": "113724982", "AffiliationName": "Research Department, Young Epilepsy"}, "24479788300": {"Name": "Neville B.G.R.", "AuthorID": "24479788300", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health University College London"}, "23968672700": {"Name": "Atkinson P.", "AuthorID": "23968672700", "AffiliationID": "60011982", "AffiliationName": "Child Development Centre, Crawley Hospital"}, "16030504100": {"Name": "Chin R.F.", "AuthorID": "16030504100", "AffiliationID": "60027272", "AffiliationName": "Muir Maxwell Epilepsy Centre, Edinburgh Neurosciences, The University of Edinburgh"}, "6603729064": {"Name": "Aylett S.E.", "AuthorID": "6603729064", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health University College London"}, "7404342499": {"Name": "Scott R.C.", "AuthorID": "7404342499", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Child Health University College London"}, "7101634220": {"Name": "Gillberg C.", "AuthorID": "7101634220", "AffiliationID": "60016437", "AffiliationName": "Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg"}}}
