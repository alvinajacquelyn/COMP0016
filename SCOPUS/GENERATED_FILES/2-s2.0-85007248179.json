The Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes (SCOUT) trial can provide the first evidence of the effect of intentional weight loss on mortality in an obese population at high risk. Methods: SCOUT wasarandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing sibutramine vs. placebo. Eligibility for the trial required both men and women aged at least 55 years, with BMI of at least 27kg/m2 45kg/m2 or less. Study participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) only should have at least one other risk factor defined as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, or diabetic nephropathy, and/or they had a history of cardiovascular disease. Study participants were stratified in three groups: patients with T2DM, patients with a prior cardiovascular event but without diabetes, and patients with both T2DM and a prior cardiovascular event. The relationship between weight loss and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular) was investigated with Cox regression models. Results: The main study showed that all-cause mortality was not different in patients allocated to sibutramine or placebo. This ancillary analysis demonstrates that there is a general trend showing higher mortality in patients with the greatest weight loss (weight reduction >10 kg) and in those with increasing weight (>1 kg). If integrated weight loss (area under the curve from baseline to 12 months) is used, these observations are confirmed. The impact of substantial weight loss on mortality is marked in those dying of noncardiovascular causes, specifically cancer. Conclusion: The relationship between weight change and mortality differs for cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac diseases", "Diabetes", "Obesity", "Prognosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cardiovascular Diseases", "Cause of Death", "Double-Blind Method", "Humans", "Weight Loss"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85007248179", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57203255222": {"Name": "Maggioni A.P.", "AuthorID": "57203255222", "AffiliationID": "60172681", "AffiliationName": "ANMCO Research Center"}, "7003762624": {"Name": "Urso R.", "AuthorID": "7003762624", "AffiliationID": "60172681", "AffiliationName": "ANMCO Research Center"}, "7005056126": {"Name": "Caterson I.D.", "AuthorID": "7005056126", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Boden Institute of Obesity, Nutrition Exercise and Eating Disorders, University of Sydney"}, "57203656071": {"Name": "Seimon R.V.", "AuthorID": "57203656071", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Boden Institute of Obesity, Nutrition Exercise and Eating Disorders, University of Sydney"}, "55771103700": {"Name": "Sweeting A.", "AuthorID": "55771103700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "Boden Institute of Obesity, Nutrition Exercise and Eating Disorders, University of Sydney"}, "6603737079": {"Name": "Coutinho W.", "AuthorID": "6603737079", "AffiliationID": "60032361, 60084133", "AffiliationName": "State Institute of Diabetes and Endocrinology, Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro"}, "35461137000": {"Name": "Finer N.", "AuthorID": "35461137000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "National Centre for Cardiovascular Prevention and Outcomes, Institute for Cardiovascular Science, University College London"}, "7005249139": {"Name": "Van Gaal L.", "AuthorID": "7005249139", "AffiliationID": "60013703", "AffiliationName": "Department of Diabetology, Metabolism and Clinical Nutrition, Antwerp University Hospital"}, "24335371100": {"Name": "Legler U.F.", "AuthorID": "24335371100", "AffiliationID": "114184162", "AffiliationName": "Special Vocational College for Handicapped Persons"}, "7404971729": {"Name": "Sharma A.M.", "AuthorID": "7404971729", "AffiliationID": "60030835", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine, University of Alberta"}, "57210100954": {"Name": "Torp-Pedersen C.", "AuthorID": "57210100954", "AffiliationID": "60022134", "AffiliationName": "Department of Health, Science and Technology, Aalborg University"}, "7401962956": {"Name": "James W.P.T.", "AuthorID": "7401962956", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
