The method analytically estimates a target registration error (TRE),accounting for errors in the manual selection of both 2D- and 3D landmarks,that agrees with Monte Carlo simulation to within 4.5 \u00b1 3.6 % (mean \u00b1 SD). We also show how to analytically estimate a planning uncertainty incorporating uncertainty in patient positioning,and utilise it to support ERCP-guided procedure planning by selecting the optimal patient position and X-ray C-arm orientation that minimises the expected TRE. Simulated- and derived planning uncertainties agreed to within 17.9 \u00b1 9.7 % when the root-mean-square error was less than 50\u00b0. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach on clinical data from two patients.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["2-D-3-D registration", "Analytical method", "Clinical data", "Image-guided", "Patient positioning", "Procedure planning", "Root mean square errors", "Target registration errors"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996486063", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"24512208500": {"Name": "Hu Y.", "AuthorID": "24512208500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "56578552900": {"Name": "Bonmati E.", "AuthorID": "56578552900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36026807300": {"Name": "Gibson E.", "AuthorID": "36026807300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602192523": {"Name": "Hipwell J.", "AuthorID": "6602192523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7005201740": {"Name": "Barratt D.", "AuthorID": "7005201740", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35775945600": {"Name": "Bandula S.", "AuthorID": "35775945600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, University College London"}, "55944100900": {"Name": "Pereira S.", "AuthorID": "55944100900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Liver and Digestive Health, University College London"}}}
