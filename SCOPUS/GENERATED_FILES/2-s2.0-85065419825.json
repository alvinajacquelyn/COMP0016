Studies of Alzheimer's disease brain extracts suggest that amyloid-\u03b2, which migrates on sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of \u223c7 kDa (7kDa-A\u03b2), is particularly toxic; however, the nature of this species has been controversial. Using sophisticated mass spectrometry and sensitive assays of disease-relevant toxicity we show that brain-derived bioactive 7kDa-A\u03b2 contains a heterogeneous mixture of covalently cross-linked dimers in the absence of any other detectable proteins. The identification of amyloid-\u03b2 dimers may open a new phase of Alzheimer's research and allow a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease, and how to monitor and treat this devastating disorder. Future studies investigating the bioactivity of individual dimers cross-linked at known sites will be critical to this effort.", "AuthorKeywords": ["amyloid-\u03b2-protein", "human neurons", "long-term potentiation", "mass spectrometry", "video microscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Animals", "Brain", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Organ Culture Techniques", "Protein Multimerization"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065419825", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"6602971570": {"Name": "Brinkmalm G.", "AuthorID": "6602971570", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "12806782700": {"Name": "Portelius E.", "AuthorID": "12806782700", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57208899083": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "57208899083", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UK Dementia Research Institute at UCL"}, "56415176000": {"Name": "Blennow K.", "AuthorID": "56415176000", "AffiliationID": "60031699", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Sahlgrenska University Hospital"}, "57199155317": {"Name": "Hong W.", "AuthorID": "57199155317", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Research, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Hale Building for Transformative Medicine"}, "56644043900": {"Name": "Wang Z.", "AuthorID": "56644043900", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Research, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Hale Building for Transformative Medicine"}, "56488632500": {"Name": "Liu W.", "AuthorID": "56488632500", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Research, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Hale Building for Transformative Medicine"}, "7003570521": {"Name": "O'Malley T.T.", "AuthorID": "7003570521", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Research, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Hale Building for Transformative Medicine"}, "57208655575": {"Name": "Sun X.", "AuthorID": "57208655575", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Research, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Hale Building for Transformative Medicine"}, "56761657900": {"Name": "Selkoe D.J.", "AuthorID": "56761657900", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Research, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Hale Building for Transformative Medicine"}, "7402053531": {"Name": "Walsh D.M.", "AuthorID": "7402053531", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60016782", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Research, Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Hale Building for Transformative Medicine"}, "7103306284": {"Name": "Frosch M.P.", "AuthorID": "7103306284", "AffiliationID": "60002746, 60029929", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School"}}}
