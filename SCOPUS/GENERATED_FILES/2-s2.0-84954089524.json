The ICM was isolated using laser microsurgery and plated on \u03b3-irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts. Both the derivation and cell line propagation were performed in an animal product-free environment and under current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) standards. Pluripotent state and differentiation potential were confirmed by in vitro assays. The line was also validated for sterility, specific and non-specific human pathogens.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cell Differentiation", "Cell Line", "Comparative Genomic Hybridization", "Embryo, Mammalian", "Genotype", "Histocompatibility Testing", "Human Embryonic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Male", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Middle Aged", "Transcription Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84954089524", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56116786300": {"Name": "Devito L.", "AuthorID": "56116786300", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "37052138600": {"Name": "Jacquet L.", "AuthorID": "37052138600", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "57205772954": {"Name": "Petrova A.", "AuthorID": "57205772954", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "55240228400": {"Name": "Miere C.", "AuthorID": "55240228400", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "8760583500": {"Name": "Wood V.", "AuthorID": "8760583500", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "36662419100": {"Name": "Kadeva N.", "AuthorID": "36662419100", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "24070032100": {"Name": "Cornwell G.", "AuthorID": "24070032100", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "54784182300": {"Name": "Codognotto S.", "AuthorID": "54784182300", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "19934377500": {"Name": "Stephenson E.", "AuthorID": "19934377500", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}, "7005535777": {"Name": "Ilic D.", "AuthorID": "7005535777", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell Laboratories, Division of Women's Health, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London and Assisted Conception Unit, Guys' Hospital"}}}
