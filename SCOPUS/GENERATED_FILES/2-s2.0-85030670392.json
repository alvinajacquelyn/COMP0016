Thus far, no other disease associated GOSR2 mutation has been reported. Methods: From epilepsy, movement disorder and genetic clinics 43 patients suffering from progressive myoclonus epilepsy/ataxia were screened for defects in GOSR2, SCARB2 and CSTB. Results: A 61-year-old female patient suffering from progressive myoclonus epilepsy was found to be compound heterozygous for the known c.430G>T and a novel c.491_493delAGA (p.K164del) GOSR2 mutation. This is so far the oldest GOSR2 patient and her disease course seems overall milder. Conclusions: This finding further highlights the GOSR2 gene as a cause of progressive myoclonus epilepsy and expands the genotype for a potentially weaker disease allele.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ataxia", "GOSR2", "myoclonus", "progressive myoclonus ataxia", "progressive myoclonus epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030670392", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"57195985686": {"Name": "Praschberger R.", "AuthorID": "57195985686", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35176436700": {"Name": "Mencacci N.E.", "AuthorID": "35176436700", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}, "13403335000": {"Name": "Hersheson J.", "AuthorID": "13403335000", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}, "8581587200": {"Name": "Bettencourt C.", "AuthorID": "8581587200", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}, "7003363686": {"Name": "Houlden H.", "AuthorID": "7003363686", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology and The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (NHNN)"}, "7006451604": {"Name": "Kullmann D.M.", "AuthorID": "7006451604", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Epilepsy, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "25642482400": {"Name": "Balint B.", "AuthorID": "25642482400", "AffiliationID": "60003280", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, University Hospital Heidelberg"}, "25958636400": {"Name": "Bhatia K.", "AuthorID": "25958636400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Sobell Department of Motor Neuroscience and Movement Disorders, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "35367017900": {"Name": "Rubio-Agusti I.", "AuthorID": "35367017900", "AffiliationID": "60032451", "AffiliationName": "Unidad de Trastornos del Movimiento, Hospital Universitario La Fe"}}}
