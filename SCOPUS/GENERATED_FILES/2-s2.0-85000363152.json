However, clinically sensitive tools to objectively assess the difficulties are lacking. This study aimed to pilot a new clinical measure of social disinhibition, the social disinhibition task (SDT). Whether social disinhibition is dependent on the type of social information judgements required and whether disinhibited responses can be adjusted with additional guidance were also examined. Participants were 31 adults (25 Male) with moderate-to-severe TBI and 22 adult (17 Male) healthy control participants. Participants viewed scenes of complex social situations and were asked to describe a character in them (Part A), describe a character while inhibiting inappropriate or negative responses (Part B), and describe a character while not only inhibiting negative responses, but also providing positive responses (Part C). One-half of the items contained a faux pas requiring participants to make inferences about a character's mental state. TBI and control participants responded similarly to Part A, although control participants responded less positively than TBI participants in the faux pas items. TBI participants were significantly impaired on Part B indicating they experienced difficulties in inhibiting automatic responding. TBI participants were however able to adjust their responding in Part C so that they respond similarly to the control participants. Between group differences were not detected in reaction time. Overall, the SDT appears to be suitable to detect social inhibition difficulties in clinical settings and provides a new direction for remediation of the difficulties in individuals with TBI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["social cognition", "social disinhibition", "theory of mind", "traumatic brain injury"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85000363152", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"22034657900": {"Name": "Honan C.A.", "AuthorID": "22034657900", "AffiliationID": "115944133", "AffiliationName": "Moving Ahead NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Brain Recovery"}, "57192195758": {"Name": "Allen S.K.", "AuthorID": "57192195758", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "56337356700": {"Name": "Osborne-Crowley K.", "AuthorID": "56337356700", "AffiliationID": "60028333", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of New South Wales"}, "7202568889": {"Name": "McDonald S.", "AuthorID": "7202568889", "AffiliationID": "115944133", "AffiliationName": "Moving Ahead NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Brain Recovery"}, "55753266700": {"Name": "Fisher A.", "AuthorID": "55753266700", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, Centre for Medical Psychology and Evidence-Based Decision Making (CeMPED), University of Sydney"}}}
