One purpose of this activity during action observation may be to predict the visual consequence of another person\u2019s action based on their movement kinematics. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the primary motor cortex (M1) may have a causal role in inferring information that is present in the kinematics of observed actions. Healthy participants completed an action perception task before and after applying continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over left M1. A neurophysiological marker was used to quantify the extent of M1 disruption following cTBS and stratify our sample a priori to provide an internal control. We found that a disruption to M1 caused a reduction in an individual\u2019s sensitivity to interpret the kinematics of observed actions; the magnitude of suppression of motor excitability predicted this change in sensitivity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Internal controls", "Motor systems", "Movement kinematics", "nocv2", "Primary motor cortex", "Theta burst stimulations", "Adult", "Analysis of Variance", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Electromyography", "Evoked Potentials, Motor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Motion Perception", "Motor Cortex", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Social Perception", "Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994091623", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"56946189100": {"Name": "Palmer C.", "AuthorID": "56946189100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "14624988100": {"Name": "Bunday K.", "AuthorID": "14624988100", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603130968": {"Name": "Davare M.", "AuthorID": "6603130968", "AffiliationID": "60025063", "AffiliationName": "KU Leuven"}, "7006483714": {"Name": "Kilner J.", "AuthorID": "7006483714", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
