LRRK2 has been associated with a range of cellular processes, however its physiological and pathological functions remain unclear. The most prevalent LRRK2 mutations in PD have been shown to affect macroautophagy in various cellular models while a role in autophagy signalling has been recapitulated in vivo. Dysregulation of autophagy has been implicated in PD pathology, and this raises the possibility that differential autophagic activity is relevant to disease progression in PD patients carrying LRRK2 mutations. To examine the relevance of LRRK2 to the regulation of macroautophagy in a disease setting we examined the levels of autophagic markers in the basal ganglia of G2019S LRRK2 PD post-mortem tissue, in comparison to pathology-matched idiopathic PD (iPD), using immunoblotting (IB). Significantly lower levels of p62 and LAMP1 were observed in G2019S LRRK2 PD compared to iPD cases. Similarly, an increase in ULK1 was observed in iPD but was not reflected in G2019S LRRK2 PD cases. Furthermore, examination of p62 by immunohistochemistry (IH) recapitulated a distinct signature for G2019S PD. IH of LAMP1, LC3 and ULK1 broadly correlated with the IB results. Our data from a small but pathologically well-characterized cases highlights a divergence of G2019S PD carriers in terms of autophagic response in alpha-synuclein pathology affected brain regions compared to iPD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Autophagy", "LAMP1", "LC3", "LRRK2", "p62", "Parkinson's", "ULK1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "alpha-Synuclein", "Autophagy", "Brain", "Female", "Humans", "Leucine-Rich Repeat Serine-Threonine Protein Kinase-2", "Lewy Bodies", "Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins", "Male", "Parkinson Disease", "Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases", "RNA-Binding Proteins"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050805968", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Molecular Biology", "BIOC", "1312"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"]], "AuthorData": {"27467539800": {"Name": "Mamais A.", "AuthorID": "27467539800", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, NIA, NIH"}, "57203168039": {"Name": "Nazish I.", "AuthorID": "57203168039", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57203170480": {"Name": "Sonustun B.", "AuthorID": "57203170480", "AffiliationID": "60115564, 60019953", "AffiliationName": "Reta Lila Weston Institute of Neurological Studies, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "57210127924": {"Name": "Warner T.T.", "AuthorID": "57210127924", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "6603278141": {"Name": "Bandopadhyay R.", "AuthorID": "6603278141", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Movement Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "7006533543": {"Name": "Cookson M.R.", "AuthorID": "7006533543", "AffiliationID": "60017252, 60006577", "AffiliationName": "Cell Biology and Gene Expression Section, Laboratory of Neurogenetics, NIA, NIH"}, "12775007400": {"Name": "Manzoni C.", "AuthorID": "12775007400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "14045338700": {"Name": "Lewis P.A.", "AuthorID": "14045338700", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "53163080800": {"Name": "Arber C.", "AuthorID": "53163080800", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}, "19934657400": {"Name": "Wray S.", "AuthorID": "19934657400", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurodegenerative Diseases, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
