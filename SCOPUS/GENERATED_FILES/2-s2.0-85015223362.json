In this study, we examined whether the distance to the primary healthcare clinic (PHCC) was associated with risk of depression in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Depressive symptoms and household coordinates data were accessed from the nationally representative South African National Income Dynamics Study. Distances between households and their nearest PHCCs were calculated and mixed-effects logistic regression models fitted to the data. Participants residing <6 km from a PHCC (aOR = 0.608, 95% CI 0.42\u20130.87) or 6\u201314.9 km (aOR = 0. 612, 95% CI 0.44\u20130.86) had a lower depression risk compared to those residing \u226515 km from the nearest PHCC. Distance to the PHCC was independently associated with increased depression risk, even after controlling for key socioeconomic determinants. Minimizing the distance to PHCC through mobile health clinics and technology could improve mental health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Depression", "GPS", "Primary healthcare clinic", "Social disconnectedness", "South Africa"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Depression", "Female", "Geographic Information Systems", "Health Facilities", "Health Services Accessibility", "Humans", "Longitudinal Studies", "Male", "Primary Health Care", "Residence Characteristics", "Risk", "South Africa", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85015223362", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Social Psychology", "PSYC", "3207"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"55322184600": {"Name": "Tomita A.", "AuthorID": "55322184600", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "23096323900": {"Name": "Vandormael A.M.", "AuthorID": "23096323900", "AffiliationID": "60010499, 60138826", "AffiliationName": "Africa Health Research Institute, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "46460954400": {"Name": "Cuadros D.", "AuthorID": "46460954400", "AffiliationID": "60025152", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University of Cincinnati"}, "7004596566": {"Name": "Slotow R.", "AuthorID": "7004596566", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment, University College London"}, "6603089893": {"Name": "Tanser F.", "AuthorID": "6603089893", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "School of Nursing and Public Health, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "8626465000": {"Name": "Burns J.K.", "AuthorID": "8626465000", "AffiliationID": "60026479", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Health Research, University of Exeter"}}}
