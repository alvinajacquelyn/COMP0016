Objective: This study investigates whether people would be willing to adhere to current United Kingdom (UK, \"low-risk\") alcohol guidelines to reduce dementia risk. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey recruited a non-probabilistic sample of 3,948 individuals aged 50 and over without dementia in the UK. Self-reported willingness to comply with low-risk guidelines was predicted using logistic regression. Other relevant self-reported variables included physical health, lifestyle, and current alcohol intake. Results: Majority of the sample (90%, n=3,527) reported drinking alcohol at least once a month with 23% (n=795) exceeding the low-risk guidelines (>14 units per week). A larger proportion of men, those who were overweight, and people without a partner reported drinking above the recommended level. Most people who consumed alcohol (n=2,934; 74.3%) appeared willing to adhere to low-risk guidelines if they were told that their risk of having dementia could be reduced. Increased willingness was found in women (OR 1.81; CI 1.47-2.23), in people who had at least one child (OR 1.36; CI 1.09-1.70), and those who slept well (OR 1.45; CI 1.06-2.00). People who were obese (OR 0.72; CI 0.54-0.95), those who drank alcohol above limits (OR 0.13; CI 0.11-0.16), and those who were smokers (OR 0.56; CI 0.36-0.88) were less willing to adhere to current guidelines. Conclusion: Men and people with more lifestyle risk factors for common chronic diseases (e.g., smoking, obesity, and excess alcohol consumption) are less willing to adhere to current alcohol low-risk guidelines to reduce dementia risk.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alcohol", "dementia", "disease prevention", "older people", "risk reduction"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alcohol Drinking", "Body Mass Index", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Dementia", "Diet", "Female", "Guideline Adherence", "Health Status", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Overweight", "Risk Reduction Behavior", "Sex Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85067103990", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Clinical Psychology", "PSYC", "3203"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"56005614600": {"Name": "Oliveira D.", "AuthorID": "56005614600", "AffiliationID": "60014992", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP)"}, "35793798800": {"Name": "Jones K.A.", "AuthorID": "35793798800", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "7006161600": {"Name": "Orrell M.", "AuthorID": "7006161600", "AffiliationID": "60015138, 60172395", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Mental Health, Division of Psychiatry and Applied Psychology, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "23568688400": {"Name": "Ogollah R.", "AuthorID": "23568688400", "AffiliationID": "60030816", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit, Queen's Medical Centre"}, "57209266518": {"Name": "Ozupek S.", "AuthorID": "57209266518", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, University Park Campus"}, "55391833400": {"Name": "Hogervorst E.", "AuthorID": "55391833400", "AffiliationID": "60000891", "AffiliationName": "School of Sport, Exercise and Health Sciences, Loughborough University"}}}
