Crosstalk between CD4+ T cells and proliferating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tumor B cells occurs within lymphoid tissue pseudofollicles, and investigating these interactions is essential to understand both disease pathogenesis and the effects of immunotherapy. Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV) shedding is emerging as an important mode of intercellular communication in the TME. In order to characterize tumor EVs released in response to T-cell-derived TME signals, we performed microRNA (miRNA [miR]) profiling of EVs released from CLL cells stimulated with CD40 and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Our results reveal an enrichment of specific cellular miRNAs including miR-363 within EVs derived from CD40/IL-4-stimulated CLL cells compared with parental cell miRNA content and control EVs from unstimulated CLL cells. We demonstrate that autologous patient CD4+ T cells internalize CLL-EVs containing miR-363 that targets the immunomodulatory molecule CD69. We further reveal that autologous CD4+ T cells that are exposed to EVs from CD40/IL-4-stimulated CLL cells exhibit enhanced migration, immunological synapse signaling, and interactions with tumor cells. Knockdown of miR-363 in CLL cells prior to CD40/IL-4 stimulation prevented the ability of CLL-EVs to induce increased synapse signaling and confer altered functional properties to CD4+ T cells. Taken together, these data reveal a novel role for CLL-EVs in modifying T-cell function that highlights unanticipated complexity of intercellular communication that may have implications for bidirectional CD4+ T-cell:tumor interactions within the TME.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antigens, CD40", "CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes", "Cell Communication", "Female", "Humans", "Interleukin-4", "Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell", "Male", "MicroRNAs", "Neoplasm Proteins", "RNA, Neoplasm", "Secretory Vesicles", "Tumor Cells, Cultured"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014464571", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"13103158500": {"Name": "Smallwood D.T.", "AuthorID": "13103158500", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester"}, "18937981200": {"Name": "Willimott S.", "AuthorID": "18937981200", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester"}, "6506451435": {"Name": "Lezina L.", "AuthorID": "6506451435", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester"}, "57194465972": {"Name": "Alharthi A.", "AuthorID": "57194465972", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester"}, "7402232677": {"Name": "Wagner S.D.", "AuthorID": "7402232677", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cancer Studies, Ernest and Helen Scott Haematology Research Institute, University of Leicester"}, "24467600000": {"Name": "Apollonio B.", "AuthorID": "24467600000", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haemato-Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "24462154000": {"Name": "Ramsay A.G.", "AuthorID": "24462154000", "AffiliationID": "60177635", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haemato-Oncology, Division of Cancer Studies, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London"}, "57194471622": {"Name": "Ambrose A.R.", "AuthorID": "57194471622", "AffiliationID": "60033125", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leicester"}, "55642542500": {"Name": "De Rossi G.", "AuthorID": "55642542500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Microvascular Research, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}}}
