In all experiments Ga was found to be enriched in light isotopes at the solid surface with isotope fractionation \u25b371Gasolid-solution up to \u22121.27\u2030 and \u22120.89\u2030 for calcite and goethite, respectively. Comparison of Ga isotopic data of this study with predictions for \u2018closed system\u2019 equilibrium and \u2018Rayleigh fractionation\u2019 models indicates that the experimental data are consistent with a \u2018closed system\u2019 equilibrium exchange between the fluid and the solid. The results of this study can be interpreted based on Ga aqueous speciation and the structure of Ga complexes formed at the solid surfaces. For calcite, Ga isotope fractionation is mainly triggered by increased Ga coordination and Ga\u2013O bond length, which vary respectively from 4 and 1.84 \u00c5 in Ga(OH)4\u2212 to 6 and 1.94 \u00c5 in the >Ca\u2013O\u2013GaOH(OH2)4+ surface complex. For goethite, despite the formation of Ga hexa-coordinated >FeOGa(OH)20 surface complexes (Ga\u2013O distances of 1.96\u20131.98 \u00c5) both at acid and alkaline pH, a similar extent of isotope fractionation was found at acid and alkaline pH, suggesting that Ga(OH)4\u2212 is preferentially adsorbed on goethite for all investigated pH conditions. In addition, the observed decrease of Ga isotope fractionation magnitude observed with increasing Ga surface coverage for both calcite and goethite is likely related to the formation of Ga surface polymers and/or hydroxides with reduced Ga\u2013O distances. This first study of Ga isotope fractionation during solid-fluid interactions suggests that the adsorption of Ga by oxides, carbonates or clay minerals could yield significant Ga isotope fractionation between secondary minerals and surficial fluids including seawater. Ga isotopes thus should help to better characterize the surficial biogeochemical cycles of gallium and its geochemical analog aluminum.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adsorption", "Calcite", "Gallium isotopes", "Goethite", "Significant fractionation"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039747692", "SubjectAreas": [["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"]], "AuthorData": {"57190686023": {"Name": "Yuan W.", "AuthorID": "57190686023", "AffiliationID": "60027363", "AffiliationName": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "24757787500": {"Name": "Chen J.B.", "AuthorID": "24757787500", "AffiliationID": "60014466, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "57199402311": {"Name": "Liu Y.", "AuthorID": "57199402311", "AffiliationID": "60014466, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Environmental Geochemistry, Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "6507453027": {"Name": "Saldi G.D.", "AuthorID": "6507453027", "AffiliationID": "60027245", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9oscience Environnement Toulouse, CNRS (UMP 5563)-OMP-Universit\u00e9 Paul-Sabatier"}, "7103177603": {"Name": "Schott J.", "AuthorID": "7103177603", "AffiliationID": "60027245", "AffiliationName": "G\u00e9oscience Environnement Toulouse, CNRS (UMP 5563)-OMP-Universit\u00e9 Paul-Sabatier"}, "56981775700": {"Name": "Vetuschi Zuccolini M.", "AuthorID": "56981775700", "AffiliationID": "60025153", "AffiliationName": "Laboratorio di Geochimica at DIPTERIS, Universit\u00e0 di Genova"}, "7004338659": {"Name": "Birck J.L.", "AuthorID": "7004338659", "AffiliationID": "60001970", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Geochimie et Cosmochimie, Institute de Physique du Globe de Paris (IPGP)"}}}
