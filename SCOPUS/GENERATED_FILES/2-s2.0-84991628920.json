Low-visibility conditions were simulated using an artificial fog machine and smoke flares in a 50 m PVC corridor with several bi-directional wireless optical links established at wavelengths in the 1270 nm-1550 nm range with an additional green laser based measurement system. In low visibility conditions the variation in attenuation with wavelength was found to be larger than predicted by the standard model. We propose a new empirical model for this region and show that longer infra-red wavelengths are more suitable for free space optical communication.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Atmospheric chambers", "Experiment design", "Free Space Optical communication", "Free space optical systems", "Low visibility conditions", "Spectral analyzers", "The standard model", "Wireless-optical"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991628920", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Signal Processing", "COMP", "1711"]], "AuthorData": {"56021918200": {"Name": "Mustafa L.", "AuthorID": "56021918200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7006614570": {"Name": "Thomsen B.", "AuthorID": "7006614570", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57170651700": {"Name": "Cerncic E.", "AuthorID": "57170651700", "AffiliationID": "116449596", "AffiliationName": "Institute IRNAS Race"}}}
