Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.The synthesis and aqueous self-assembly of a new class of amphiphilic aliphatic polyesters are presented. These AB block polyesters comprise polycaprolactone (hydrophobe) and an alternating polyester from succinic acid and an ether-substituted epoxide (hydrophile). They self-assemble into biodegradable polymersomes capable of entering cells. Their degradation products are bioactive, giving rise to differentiated cellular responses inducing stromal cell proliferation and macrophage apoptosis. Both effects emerge only when the copolymers enter cells as polymersomes and their magnitudes are size dependent.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cells", "drug discovery", "polymers", "ring opening", "self-assembly"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aliphatic polyester", "Biodegradable polymersomes", "Cellular response", "Degradation products", "Drug discovery", "Ring opening", "Size dependent", "Succinic acids", "Apoptosis", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Proliferation", "Cell Survival", "Fibroblasts", "Humans", "Hydrolysis", "Macrophages", "Molecular Structure", "Optical Imaging", "Particle Size", "Polyesters", "Surface Properties", "Surface-Active Agents"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062324263", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"56379224400": {"Name": "Zhu Y.", "AuthorID": "56379224400", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "55476614900": {"Name": "Williams C.K.", "AuthorID": "55476614900", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Research Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, University of Oxford"}, "36504922400": {"Name": "Poma A.", "AuthorID": "36504922400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Institute of Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}, "26644315100": {"Name": "Rizzello L.", "AuthorID": "26644315100", "AffiliationID": "60104011, 60108879", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology"}, "56823300900": {"Name": "Gouveia V.M.", "AuthorID": "56823300900", "AffiliationID": "60007249", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical Sciences, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Porto"}, "15063332400": {"Name": "Ruiz-Perez L.", "AuthorID": "15063332400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC/Jeol Centre for Liquid Phase Electron Microscopy, University College London"}, "57204254218": {"Name": "Battaglia G.", "AuthorID": "57204254218", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "EPSRC/Jeol Centre for Liquid Phase Electron Microscopy, University College London"}}}
