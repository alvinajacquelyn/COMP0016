However, motility metrics often do not offer insights into the nature of contractile action. This study introduces a systematic method of making spatio-temporal measurements of contractions, based on changes in bowel lumen diameter. Methods: Two heterogeneous cohorts of subjects were selected displaying gastric (n = 15) and colonic motility (n = 20) on which to test the spatio-temporal motility MRI (STMM) technique. STMM involved delineating the bowel lumen along with inner and outer bowel wall along a section of the gastrointestinal tract. A series of diameter measurements were made automatically across the central axis of the lumen. Measurements were automatically propagated through the time series using a previously validated algorithm. Contractions were quantitatively summarized with two methods measuring (a) normalized contraction plot (NCP) and (b) combined velocity distance (CVD) both of which can be visualized as spatio-temporal motility maps. Both metrics were correlated against subjective visual scoring systems. Key Results: Good correlation was seen between reader scores and both motility metrics (NCP, R = 0.85, P < 0.001, CVD, R = 0.93, R < 0.001) in the gastric data. Good correlation was also seen between the reader scores and the two metrics in the colonic data (NCP, R = 0.82, P < 0.001, CVD, R = 0.78, R < 0.001). Conclusions and Inferences: Spatio-temporal motility MRI analysis of the stomach and colon correlates well with reader scores in a range of datasets and provides both a quantitative and qualitative means of assessing contractile activity in the gastrointestinal tract.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Colon", "Female", "Gastrointestinal Motility", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Stomach"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85062327003", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"54886504700": {"Name": "Menys A.", "AuthorID": "54886504700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "57210526592": {"Name": "Atkinson D.", "AuthorID": "57210526592", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "57203543924": {"Name": "Taylor S.A.", "AuthorID": "57203543924", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Imaging, UCL"}, "6505868562": {"Name": "Hoad C.", "AuthorID": "6505868562", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60099153, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "7005287882": {"Name": "Spiller R.", "AuthorID": "7005287882", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60099153, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "6602443044": {"Name": "Marciani L.", "AuthorID": "6602443044", "AffiliationID": "60025016, 60172935, 60099153, 60172638", "AffiliationName": "Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and University of Nottingham"}, "8733177200": {"Name": "Scott S.M.", "AuthorID": "8733177200", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Wingate Centre for Neurogastroenterology, Blizard Institute, QMUL"}}}
