Karger AG, Basel. All rights reserved.Objective: AURA was an observational study that monitored visual acuity outcomes following ranibizumab use in neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients over 2 years. The aim of this analysis was to identify factors that were predictive of visual acuity outcomes in AURA. Methods: The correlation between the baseline characteristics, the use of resources and the visual acuity outcomes in AURA was explored using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The response variables analysed were mean change in visual acuity over 2 years (analysed via PCA) and no decline in visual acuity at 2 years compared with baseline (analysed via PLS-DA). Results: The AURA dataset comprised 2,227 patients and 132 variables. Using PCA and PLS-DA, we found that the number of ranibizumab injections, clinic and monitoring visits, number of optical coherence tomography scans and ophthalmoscopies correlated with a change in visual acuity at Years 1 and 2, and are therefore key drivers of treatment success. Conclusion: This is a novel approach to graphically explore relationships between multiple correlated covariates and outcomes in real-life ophthalmology studies. It identified a number of variables that are positively linked with treatment outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AURA", "Intravitreal ranibizumab", "Neovascular age-related macular degeneration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Angiogenesis Inhibitors", "Discriminant Analysis", "Fluorescein Angiography", "Follow-Up Studies", "Fundus Oculi", "Humans", "Intravitreal Injections", "Macula Lutea", "Ophthalmoscopy", "Principal Component Analysis", "Ranibizumab", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors", "Tomography, Optical Coherence", "Treatment Outcome", "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A", "Visual Acuity", "Wet Macular Degeneration"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995757614", "SubjectAreas": [["Ophthalmology", "MEDI", "2731"], ["Sensory Systems", "NEUR", "2809"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"57201820304": {"Name": "Holz F.G.", "AuthorID": "57201820304", "AffiliationID": "60007493", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn"}, "8282203500": {"Name": "Wittrup-Jensen K.", "AuthorID": "8282203500", "AffiliationID": "60099558", "AffiliationName": "Bayer Pharmaceuticals"}, "57189249282": {"Name": "Altemark A.", "AuthorID": "57189249282", "AffiliationID": "60099558", "AffiliationName": "Bayer Pharmaceuticals"}, "6602700022": {"Name": "Tadayoni R.", "AuthorID": "6602700022", "AffiliationID": "60021374, 60123796, 60021567", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, H\u00f4pital Lariboisi\u00e8re, AP-HP, Universit\u00e9 Paris 7"}, "57203383644": {"Name": "Beatty S.", "AuthorID": "57203383644", "AffiliationID": "108445877", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Eye Surgery"}, "56225371600": {"Name": "Berger A.R.", "AuthorID": "56225371600", "AffiliationID": "60017018, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences, University of Toronto and St Michael's Hospital"}, "35749426400": {"Name": "Cereda M.G.", "AuthorID": "35749426400", "AffiliationID": "60002200, 60030318", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical and Clinical Science Luigi Sacco, Luigi Sacco Hospital, University of Milan"}, "7003429874": {"Name": "Hykin P.", "AuthorID": "7003429874", "AffiliationID": "60016691", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Biomedical Centre for Research in Ophthalmology, Moorfields Eye Hospital"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "60021923", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, King's College Hospital"}, "57210606602": {"Name": "Hoyng C.B.", "AuthorID": "57210606602", "AffiliationID": "60002573", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre"}, "7401810546": {"Name": "Nilsson J.", "AuthorID": "7401810546", "AffiliationID": "60112093", "AffiliationName": "Mapi Group, Real World Strategy and Analytics"}, "57189250877": {"Name": "Kim K.", "AuthorID": "57189250877", "AffiliationID": "60000666", "AffiliationName": "Health Economics, AstraZeneca Nordic-Baltic"}}}
