The Authors.Kelvin-Helmholtz waves (KHWs), which have been widely observed at the magnetopause in the region near the Earth, play an essential role in the transport of solar wind plasma and energy into the magnetosphere under dominantly northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions. In this study, we present simultaneous observations of KHWs under the northward IMF observed by both the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence, and Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft in the Earth's magnetotail around the lunar orbit (at X ~ \u221250RE, Y ~ 30RE, dusk side) and the Geotail in the near-Earth space (at X ~ \u22125RE, Y ~ \u221210RE, dawn side). The KHWs are quantitatively characterized by their dominant period, phase velocity, and wavelength, utilizing wavelet analysis and an approximation of their center-of-mass velocity. Our results suggest that the phase velocity and spatial scale of KHWs may increase as they propagate along the boundary layer toward the tail. Alternatively, the differences between the ARTEMIS and Geotail observations may indicate the possibility of dawn-dusk asymmetry in the excited KHWs in this study. Our results strongly evidence the existence of the development of KHWs in terms of their wave frequency and scale size in the magnetotail and provide insight to the time evolution of KHWs along the magnetopause.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047611570", "SubjectAreas": [["Geophysics", "EART", "1908"], ["Forestry", "AGRI", "1107"], ["Oceanography", "EART", "1910"], ["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Ecology", "ENVI", "2303"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"], ["Soil Science", "AGRI", "1111"], ["Geochemistry and Petrology", "EART", "1906"], ["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"], ["Earth and Planetary Sciences (miscellaneous)", "EART", "1901"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"], ["Paleontology", "EART", "1911"]], "AuthorData": {"57200201991": {"Name": "Ling Y.", "AuthorID": "57200201991", "AffiliationID": "60019118, 60133771", "AffiliationName": "CAS Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment, School of Earth and Space Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China"}, "13605264100": {"Name": "Shi Q.", "AuthorID": "13605264100", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "35264900100": {"Name": "Shen X.C.", "AuthorID": "35264900100", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "57203262368": {"Name": "Tian A.", "AuthorID": "57203262368", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "6603982437": {"Name": "Degeling A.W.", "AuthorID": "6603982437", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "8610497700": {"Name": "Nowada M.", "AuthorID": "8610497700", "AffiliationID": "60108071", "AffiliationName": "Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy and Solar-Terrestrial Environment, School of Space Science and Physics, Shandong University"}, "57065971200": {"Name": "Li W.", "AuthorID": "57065971200", "AffiliationID": "60004855", "AffiliationName": "Swedish Institute of Space Physics"}, "35238619300": {"Name": "Tang B.", "AuthorID": "35238619300", "AffiliationID": "60019499", "AffiliationName": "State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, National Space Science Center (NSSC), Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "55793187259": {"Name": "Hasegawa H.", "AuthorID": "55793187259", "AffiliationID": "60000809, 60022990", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)"}, "57192488120": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "57192488120", "AffiliationID": "60011976", "AffiliationName": "Geophysical Institute, University of Alaska Fairbanks"}, "7003431703": {"Name": "Rae I.J.", "AuthorID": "7003431703", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "19034267700": {"Name": "Fazakerley A.N.", "AuthorID": "19034267700", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}, "7006197877": {"Name": "Zong Q.G.", "AuthorID": "7006197877", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "55615539900": {"Name": "Fu S.", "AuthorID": "55615539900", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}, "7006788329": {"Name": "Pu Z.", "AuthorID": "7006788329", "AffiliationID": "60014966", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Space Sciences, Peking University"}}}
