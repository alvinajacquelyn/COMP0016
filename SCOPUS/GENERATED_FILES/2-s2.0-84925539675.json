We report successful operative outcomes in three infant patients with terminal myelocystocele.Background: Terminal myelocystocele is a severe form of spinal dysraphism characterized by cystic expansion of the terminal spinal cord that herniates through a deficiency of the posterior sacral spinal elements to fuse with the subcutaneous fat. Postnatal enlargement of the subcutaneous fluid-filled sac may result in progressive neurological deficit and threaten the viability of the overlying skin. Surgical repair entails spinal cord untethering, resection of nonfunctional neural elements and watertight reconstruction of the terminal thecal sac. Young age at the time of surgery, large dural defect, attenuated tissues and locally altered CSF dynamics frequently mean that wound complications including CSF leakage and pseudomeningocele formation are common.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Multidisciplinary", "Myelocystocele", "Pediatric congenital", "Reconstructive surgery", "Skin flaps", "Spinal dysraphism"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Meningomyelocele", "Reconstructive Surgical Procedures", "Surgical Flaps"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84925539675", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"36613664200": {"Name": "Quong W.L.", "AuthorID": "36613664200", "AffiliationID": "60010365", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia"}, "6602164371": {"Name": "Bulstrode N.W.", "AuthorID": "6602164371", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57216295405": {"Name": "Thompson D.N.P.", "AuthorID": "57216295405", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosurgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
