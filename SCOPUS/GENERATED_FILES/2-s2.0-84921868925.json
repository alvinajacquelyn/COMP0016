We developed a method to overcome these challenges by using different isotope-labeled versions of the Girard P reagent (GP) as quantitative chargetags for the LC-MS analysis of sterols including oxysterols. METHODS: Sterols/oxysterols in plasma were extracted in ethanol containing deuterated internal standards, separated by C18 solid-phase extraction, and derivatized with GP, with or without prior oxidation of 3\u03b2-hydroxy to 3-oxo groups. RESULTS: By use of different isotope-labeled GPs, it was possible to analyze in a single LC-MS analysis both sterols/oxysterols that naturally possess a 3-oxo group and those with a 3\u03b2-hydroxy group. Intra- and interassay CVs were <15%, and recoveries for representative oxysterols and cholestenoic acids were 85%-108%. By adopting a multiplex approach to isotope labeling, we analyzed up to 4 different samples in a single run. Using plasma samples, we could demonstrate the diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism and also the export of oxysterols from brain via the jugular vein. CONCLUSIONS: This method allows the profiling of the widest range of sterols/oxysterols in a single analytical run and can be used to identify inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis and metabolism.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Brain Chemistry", "Chromatography, Liquid", "Humans", "Mass Spectrometry", "Metabolism, Inborn Errors", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Solid Phase Extraction", "Sterols"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84921868925", "SubjectAreas": [["Clinical Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1308"], ["Biochemistry (medical)", "MEDI", "2704"]], "AuthorData": {"55337323000": {"Name": "Crick P.J.", "AuthorID": "55337323000", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Grove Bldg, Swansea University"}, "7006384872": {"Name": "Bentley T.W.", "AuthorID": "7006384872", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Grove Bldg, Swansea University"}, "55656546900": {"Name": "Abdel-Khalik J.", "AuthorID": "55656546900", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Grove Bldg, Swansea University"}, "9741390400": {"Name": "Wang Y.", "AuthorID": "9741390400", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Grove Bldg, Swansea University"}, "7101683295": {"Name": "Griffiths W.J.", "AuthorID": "7101683295", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Medicine, Grove Bldg, Swansea University"}, "7004579039": {"Name": "Matthews I.", "AuthorID": "7004579039", "AffiliationID": "60004572", "AffiliationName": "College of Engineering, Swansea University"}, "26643542700": {"Name": "Clayton P.T.", "AuthorID": "26643542700", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Omics, University College London Institute of Child Health"}, "7403404366": {"Name": "Morris A.A.", "AuthorID": "7403404366", "AffiliationID": "60022871", "AffiliationName": "Willink Biochemical Genetics Unit, Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, St Mary's Hospital"}, "6602317807": {"Name": "Bigger B.W.", "AuthorID": "6602317807", "AffiliationID": "60003771", "AffiliationName": "Stem Cell and Neurotherapies, Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, University of Manchester"}, "55998485800": {"Name": "Zerbinati C.", "AuthorID": "55998485800", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "7006251525": {"Name": "Iuliano L.", "AuthorID": "7006251525", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnology, Sapienza University of Rome"}, "57202498198": {"Name": "Tritapepe L.", "AuthorID": "57202498198", "AffiliationID": "60032350", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Sapienza University of Rome"}}}
