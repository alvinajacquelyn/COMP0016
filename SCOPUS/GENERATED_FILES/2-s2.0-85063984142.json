In this work, we report the high activity/stability of a ceria-supported Ru-nanocluster (<1 nm) catalyst during the dry reforming of methane. To elucidate the structure-reactivity relationship underlying the remarkable catalytic performance, the active structure and chemical speciation of the catalyst was characterized using in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), while the surface chemistry and active intermediates were monitored by in situ ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). Methane activates on the catalyst surface at temperatures as low as 150 \u00b0C. Under reaction conditions, the existence of metal-support interactions tunes the electronic properties of the Ru nanoclusters, giving rise to a partially oxidized state of ruthenium stabilized by reduced ceria (Ru\u03b4+-CeO2-x) to sustain active chemistry, which is found to be very different from that of large Ru nanoparticles supported on ceria. The oxidation of surface carbon is also a crucial step for the completion of the catalytic cycle, and this is strongly correlated with the oxygen transfer governed by the Ru\u03b4+-CeO2-x interactions at higher temperatures (>300 \u00b0C). The possible reaction pathways and stable surface intermediates were identified using DRIFTS including ruthenium carbonyls, carboxylate species, and surface -OH groups, while polydentate carbonates may be plain spectators at the measured reaction conditions.", "AuthorKeywords": ["AP-XPS", "ceria", "DRIFTS", "dry reforming of methane", "EXAFS", "ruthenium", "XRD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Ambient-pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopies", "Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopies", "DRIFTS", "Dry reforming-of-methane", "EXAFS", "Metal-support interactions", "Structure-reactivity relationships", "X ray absorption fine structures"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85063984142", "SubjectAreas": [["Catalysis", "CENG", "1503"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"]], "AuthorData": {"55681680000": {"Name": "Liu Z.", "AuthorID": "55681680000", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Division, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "56913247100": {"Name": "Rui N.", "AuthorID": "56913247100", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Division, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "56327968800": {"Name": "Lin L.", "AuthorID": "56327968800", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Division, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "56985706700": {"Name": "Betancourt L.E.", "AuthorID": "56985706700", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Division, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "57202148623": {"Name": "Rodriguez J.A.", "AuthorID": "57202148623", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Department, Stony Brook University"}, "7004008811": {"Name": "Senanayake S.D.", "AuthorID": "7004008811", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Chemistry Division, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "57202777007": {"Name": "Li X.", "AuthorID": "57202777007", "AffiliationID": "60018554", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Engineering, Key Laboratory of Material Physics, Zhengzhou University"}, "55154198900": {"Name": "Su D.", "AuthorID": "55154198900", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "Center for Functional Nanomaterials, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "6602496053": {"Name": "Attenkofer K.", "AuthorID": "6602496053", "AffiliationID": "60006221", "AffiliationName": "National Synchrotron Light Source II, Brookhaven National Laboratory"}, "57202400547": {"Name": "Zhang F.", "AuthorID": "57202400547", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Department, Stony Brook University"}, "56956543000": {"Name": "Cen J.", "AuthorID": "56956543000", "AffiliationID": "60026415", "AffiliationName": "Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Department, Stony Brook University"}, "24825901500": {"Name": "Xu W.", "AuthorID": "24825901500", "AffiliationID": "60005498, 60028609", "AffiliationName": "X-ray Science Division, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory"}, "7006768868": {"Name": "Idriss H.", "AuthorID": "7006768868", "AffiliationID": "60092945", "AffiliationName": "Fundamental Catalysis, Centre for Research and Development (CRD), SABIC, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)"}}}
