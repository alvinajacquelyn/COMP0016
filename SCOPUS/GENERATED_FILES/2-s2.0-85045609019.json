Despite the fact that inquiry can be seen as a defining characteristic, methods for demonstrating the impact of CS on volunteers\u2019 scientific inquiry skills are limited (Phillips, Bonney, & Shirk, 2012). This assessment challenge is not unique to CS. Indeed, both formal and informal science education have seen recent calls encouraging researchers and evaluators to begin using performance as a key metric of scientific inquiry skill (Bell, Lewenstein, Shouse, & Feder, 2009; Fenichel & Schweingruber, 2010; National Research Council, 2014). The field of CS is poised to make a significant contribution to our understanding of how to measure science inquiry learning via performance-based measures.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85045609019", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (all)", "SOCI", "3300"]], "AuthorData": {"56178547100": {"Name": "Peterman K.", "AuthorID": "56178547100", "AffiliationID": "120550038", "AffiliationName": "Karen Peterman Consulting, Co"}, "8853655800": {"Name": "Becker-Klein R.", "AuthorID": "8853655800", "AffiliationID": "114273144", "AffiliationName": "STEM"}, "6507146334": {"Name": "Stylinski C.", "AuthorID": "6507146334", "AffiliationID": "60020304", "AffiliationName": "University of Maryland, Center for Environmental Science"}, "35622592000": {"Name": "Nelson A.G.", "AuthorID": "35622592000", "AffiliationID": "60005745", "AffiliationName": "University of Minnesota"}}}
