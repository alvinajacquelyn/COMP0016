These generate the vertebral column, skeletal musculature and dermis. They form sequentially, one pair at a time, from mesenchymal tissue near the tail. Somite development is a complex process. The embryo must control the number, size, and timing of somite formation, their subdivision into functional regions along three axes, regional identity such that somites develop in a region-specific way, and interactions with neighbouring tissues that coordinate them with nearby structures. Here we discuss many timing-related mechanisms that contribute to set up the spatial pattern.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Pattern formation", "Segmentation", "Segmentation clock", "Somite", "Time-space conversion"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Body Patterning", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Homeodomain Proteins", "Signal Transduction", "Somites", "Vertebrates"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940896859", "SubjectAreas": [["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"7201805780": {"Name": "Stern C.", "AuthorID": "7201805780", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}, "56715584700": {"Name": "Piatkowska A.", "AuthorID": "56715584700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University College London"}}}
