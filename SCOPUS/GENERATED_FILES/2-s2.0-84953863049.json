We aimed to explore the use of near-infrared spectroscopy in pediatric cardiac ICUs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, and Germany. Design: A cross-sectional multicenter, multinational electronic survey of one consultant in each pediatric cardiac ICU. Setting: Pediatric cardiac ICUs in the United Kingdom and Ireland (n = 13), Italy (n = 12), and Germany (n = 33). Interventions: Questionnaire targeted to establish use, targets, protocols/thresholds for intervention, and perceived usefulness of near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring. Results: Overall, 42 of 58 pediatric cardiac ICUs (72%) responded: United Kingdom and Ireland, 11 of 13 (84.6%); Italy, 12 of 12 (100%); and Germany, 19 of 33 (57%, included all major centers). Near-infrared spectroscopy usage varied with 35% (15/42) reporting that near-infrared spectroscopy was not used at all (7/42) or occasionally (8/42); near-infrared spectroscopy use was much less common in the United Kingdom (46%) when compared with 78% in Germany and all (100%) in Italy. Only four units had a near-infrared spectroscopy protocol, and 18 specifically used near-infrared spectroscopy in high-risk patients; 37 respondents believed that near-infrared spectroscopy added value to standard monitoring and 23 believed that it gave an earlier indication of deterioration, but only 19 would respond based on near-infrared spectroscopy data alone. Targets for absolute values and critical thresholds for intervention varied widely between units. The reasons cited for not or occasionally using near-infrared spectroscopy were expense (n = 6), limited evidence and uncertainty on how it guides management (n = 4), difficulty in interpretation, and unreliability of data (n = 3). Amongst the regular or occasional near-infrared spectroscopy users (n = 35), 28 (66%) agreed that a multicenter study is warranted to ascertain its use. Conclusions: Although most responding units used near-infrared spectroscopy for high-risk patients, the majority (31/35 [88%]) did not have any protocols or guidelines for intervention. Target thresholds and intervention algorithms are needed to support the use of near-infrared spectroscopy in pediatric cardiac ICUs; an international multicenter study is warranted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["brain monitoring", "cerebral oximeter", "cerebral saturation", "pediatric cardiac surgery", "regional oxygen saturation", "tissue oxygenation index"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Brain", "Cardiac Surgical Procedures", "Clinical Protocols", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Europe", "Humans", "Intensive Care Units, Pediatric", "Oximetry", "Oxygen", "Perioperative Care", "Risk Assessment", "Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953863049", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Critical Care and Intensive Care Medicine", "MEDI", "2706"]], "AuthorData": {"6507851178": {"Name": "Hoskote A.U.", "AuthorID": "6507851178", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Intensive Care and ECMO, Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7404382883": {"Name": "Brown K.L.", "AuthorID": "7404382883", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, Critical Care and Cardiorespiratory Division, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "6701455088": {"Name": "Broadhead M.W.", "AuthorID": "6701455088", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, Critical Care and Cardiorespiratory Division, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust"}, "23475954100": {"Name": "Tume L.N.", "AuthorID": "23475954100", "AffiliationID": "60024418", "AffiliationName": "Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Alder Hey Children's Hospital"}, "12792652800": {"Name": "Trieschmann U.", "AuthorID": "12792652800", "AffiliationID": "60008658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne"}, "55545950700": {"Name": "Menzel C.", "AuthorID": "55545950700", "AffiliationID": "60008658", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Heart Center, University Hospital of Cologne"}, "6603967151": {"Name": "Cogo P.", "AuthorID": "6603967151", "AffiliationID": "60017905", "AffiliationName": "Anaesthesia and Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care, Department of Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery, Bambino Ges\u00f9 Children Hospital"}}}
