As a result, they are at risk for self-stigmatization via the internalization of negative attitudes about being transgender. Thus, researchers need instruments to assess the multilayered nature of transgender identity and its role in the experience of mental health and well-being. This study evaluated the psychometric characteristics of the Transgender Identity Survey (TIS) in an Italian sample of 149 transgender people. The TIS assesses levels of pride, shame, alienation, and passing in transgender populations, providing researchers and clinicians with an instrument that can evaluate both positive aspects of transgender identity and internalized transphobia. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the original four-factor model had adequate fit to the data obtained from the Italian sample, with the exception of one item. Both convergent and predictive validity were assessed and partially confirmed, indicating that the TIS is significantly correlated with some of the enacted stigma and mental health outcome measures (perceived stress, depression, and anxiety). This study provides both clinicians and researchers with a tool to assess positive and negative aspects of identity in transgender populations.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Internalized transphobia", "minority stress", "transgender identity", "Transgender Identity Survey"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992134177", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"]], "AuthorData": {"56725707600": {"Name": "Scandurra C.", "AuthorID": "56725707600", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "SInAPSi Center, University of Naples Federico II"}, "56725267500": {"Name": "Amodeo A.", "AuthorID": "56725267500", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Humanistic Studies, University of Naples Federico II"}, "57191620960": {"Name": "Bochicchio V.", "AuthorID": "57191620960", "AffiliationID": "60020261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Humanistic Studies, University of Calabria"}, "56594664800": {"Name": "Valerio P.", "AuthorID": "56594664800", "AffiliationID": "60017293", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences and Reproductive and Odontostomatological Sciences, University of Naples Federico II"}, "12807081700": {"Name": "Frost D.", "AuthorID": "12807081700", "AffiliationID": "60021097", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Surrey"}}}
