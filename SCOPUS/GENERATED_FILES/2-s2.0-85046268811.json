A distributed methodology is proposed to detect the presence of malicious attacks aimed at compromising the stability of large-scale interconnected systems and multi-Agent systems governed by consensus-based controllers. Only knowledge of the local model is required. The detectability properties of the proposed method are analyzed. A class of undetectable attacks is identified. Preliminary simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Cyber-attacks", "Detectability", "Distributed attack detection", "Distributed control schemes", "Large-scale interconnected systems", "Local model", "Malicious attack"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046268811", "SubjectAreas": [["Decision Sciences (miscellaneous)", "DECI", "1801"], ["Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering", "ENGI", "2209"], ["Control and Optimization", "MATH", "2606"]], "AuthorData": {"54411982800": {"Name": "Boem F.", "AuthorID": "54411982800", "AffiliationID": "60071343", "AffiliationName": "KIOS Research and Innovation Centre of Excellence, University of Cyprus"}, "57193098220": {"Name": "Gallo A.J.", "AuthorID": "57193098220", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Dept. of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste"}, "6603923286": {"Name": "Ferrari-Trecate G.", "AuthorID": "6603923286", "AffiliationID": "60028186", "AffiliationName": "Automatic Control Laboratory, Cole Polytechnique de Lausanne (EPFL)"}}}
