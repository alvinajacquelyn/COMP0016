Currently, these are not available using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether diffusion MRI could be used to delineate the entire optic pathway in OPG patients, and provide imaging biomarkers within this pathway which correlate with a patient's visual acuity (VA). Methods Multi-shell diffusion MRI data were acquired in a cohort of paediatric OPG patients, along with VA measurements in each eye. Diffusion MRI data were processed using constrained spherical deconvolution and probabilistic fibre tractography, to delineate the white matter bundles forming the optic pathway in each patient. Median fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in the optic nerves, tracts, and radiations, and correlated against each patient's VA. Results In the optic nerves, median FA significantly correlated with VA (R2 adj = 0.31, p = 0.0082), with lower FA associated with poorer vision. In the optic radiations, both lower FA and higher ADC were significantly associated with poorer vision (R2 adj = 0.52, p = 0.00075 and R2 adj = 0.50, p = 0.0012 respectively). No significant correlations between VA and either FA or ADC were found in the optic tracts. Conclusions Multi-shell diffusion MRI provides in vivo delineation of the optic pathway in OPG patients, despite the presence of tumour invasion. This technique provides imaging biomarkers which are sensitive to microstructural damage to the underlying white matter in this pathway, which is not always visible on conventional MRI.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cancer", "Constrained spherical deconvolution", "Diffusion MRI", "Optic pathway glioma", "Tractography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anisotropy", "Brain Neoplasms", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Cohort Studies", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Female", "Glioma", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Infant", "Linear Models", "Male", "Neurofibromatosis 1", "Optic Nerve", "Visual Acuity", "Visual Pathways"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85034567629", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"6701651127": {"Name": "Hales P.W.", "AuthorID": "6701651127", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging & Biophysics Section, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "57211720773": {"Name": "Kaur R.", "AuthorID": "57211720773", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging & Biophysics Section, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "55290679000": {"Name": "Clark C.", "AuthorID": "55290679000", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Imaging & Biophysics Section, University College London Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}, "56583376300": {"Name": "Smith V.", "AuthorID": "56583376300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "57197757237": {"Name": "Dhanoa-Hayre D.", "AuthorID": "57197757237", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "12797538000": {"Name": "Bowman R.", "AuthorID": "12797538000", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Ophthalmology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "56702235500": {"Name": "O'Hare P.", "AuthorID": "56702235500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology and Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "7003660801": {"Name": "Phipps K.", "AuthorID": "7003660801", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology and Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "57210349888": {"Name": "Hargrave D.", "AuthorID": "57210349888", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Haematology and Oncology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "24390956300": {"Name": "Mankad K.", "AuthorID": "24390956300", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "55520827500": {"Name": "d'Arco F.", "AuthorID": "55520827500", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}, "57197757657": {"Name": "Cooper J.", "AuthorID": "57197757657", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Radiology Department, Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital"}}}
