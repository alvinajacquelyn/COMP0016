KGaA, Weinheim3D printing has the potential to transform the way in which chemical reactions are carried out due to its low-cost, ease-of-use as a technology and its capacity to expedite the development of iteratively enhanced prototypes. In this present study, we developed a novel, low-cost polypropylene (PP) column reactor that was incorporated into an existing continuous-flow reactor for the synthesis of heterocycles. The utility and solvent resistance of the printed devices were explored in SNAr reactions to produce substituted aniline derivatives and in the synthesis of bicyclic and tetracyclic heterocycles. Using this approach, a range of heterocyclic compounds was synthesised including the core structure of the natural product (\u00b1)-\u03b3-lycorane and structurally complex compounds based on the tetracyclic core of the erythrina alkaloids.", "AuthorKeywords": ["3D-printing", "Continuous flow", "Heterocycles", "Nucleophilic substitution", "Synthetic methods"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029382660", "SubjectAreas": [["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"], ["Organic Chemistry", "CHEM", "1605"]], "AuthorData": {"57193878428": {"Name": "Rao Z.X.", "AuthorID": "57193878428", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "35111571500": {"Name": "Patel B.", "AuthorID": "35111571500", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "56849964400": {"Name": "Monaco A.", "AuthorID": "56849964400", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57195615788": {"Name": "Cao Z.J.", "AuthorID": "57195615788", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "57195628470": {"Name": "Pichon E.", "AuthorID": "57195628470", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "7102480402": {"Name": "Hilton S.T.", "AuthorID": "7102480402", "AffiliationID": "60016379", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmaceutical and Biological Chemistry, UCL School of Pharmacy"}, "55951287700": {"Name": "Barniol-Xicota M.", "AuthorID": "55951287700", "AffiliationID": "60001576", "AffiliationName": "Laboratori de Qu\u00edmica Farmac\u00e8utica, Facultat de Farm\u00e0cia, and Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB), Universitat de Barcelona"}, "7003921195": {"Name": "Ladlow M.", "AuthorID": "7003921195", "AffiliationID": "108073600", "AffiliationName": "Facultat de Farm\u00e0cia, and Institute of Biomedicine (IBUB), Uniqsis Ltd"}}}
