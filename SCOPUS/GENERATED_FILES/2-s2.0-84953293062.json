In this paper we investigate the Einstein static universe in this new class of theories, which have been named scalar-fluid theories. The stability of the static solutions to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous perturbations is analyzed deriving the relevant cosmological perturbation equations at the linear order. We can find several configurations corresponding to an Einstein static universes which are stable against inhomogeneous perturbations, but unstable against homogeneous perturbations. This shows the possible applications of scalar-fluid theories to the inflationary emergent universe scenario.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84953293062", "SubjectAreas": [["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"56247935800": {"Name": "B\u00f6hmer C.", "AuthorID": "56247935800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "55015594800": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "55015594800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}, "37005969000": {"Name": "Tamanini N.", "AuthorID": "37005969000", "AffiliationID": "60019615, 60106131", "AffiliationName": "Institut de Physique Th\u00e9orique, CEA-Saclay"}}}
