Explosions are caused by various factors associated with natural, astronomical, chemical, electrical and magnetic, mechanical and vapor, and nuclear actions. The physics of explosions can be measured by impulsive forces, reaction speed, heat evolution, reaction initiation, or fragmentation. Hydrocarbons, such as oil or gas, are a typical source of energy used for engineering structures and infrastructures. Oil and gas production facilities on land and at sea commonly involve unwanted hydrocarbon leaks, which can explode through ignition when combined with an oxidizer (usually air). When the temperature increases to the point at which hydrocarbon molecules can react spontaneously with an oxidizer, combustion occurs. This hydrocarbon explosion causes a blast and a rapid increase in overpressure. This chapter describes a quantitative procedure for assessing and managing risks due to hydrocarbon explosions in structures and infrastructures. Furthermore, it presents practical examples of explosion risk assessment and management. An illustrative example of explosion risk assessment for offshore installations is presented.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070689945", "SubjectAreas": [["Safety, Risk, Reliability and Quality", "ENGI", "2213"]], "AuthorData": {"35821146600": {"Name": "Paik J.", "AuthorID": "35821146600", "AffiliationID": "60008783", "AffiliationName": "The Korea Ship and Offshore Research Institute (Lloyd\u2019s Register Foundation Research Centre of Excellence), Pusan National University"}}}
