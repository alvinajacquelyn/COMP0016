Yet such a system underpinned recorded military actions and must have evolved in response to changing military organization in the late Anglo-Saxon period. Through an assessment of documentary references to sites of muster, and by using a multidisciplinary landscape-focused approach, this article examines possible traces of that system - especially those preserved in place-names - and relates them to later Anglo-Saxon administrative geography.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996490620", "SubjectAreas": [["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Arts and Humanities (all)", "ARTS", "1200"]], "AuthorData": {"55469174300": {"Name": "Baker J.", "AuthorID": "55469174300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "55874800800": {"Name": "Brookes S.", "AuthorID": "55874800800", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
