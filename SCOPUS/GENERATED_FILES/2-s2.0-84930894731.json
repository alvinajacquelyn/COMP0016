We used immortalized human BMSC clonal lines for multi-level analysis of functional markers for BMSC subsets. All clones expressed typical BMSC cell-surface antigens; however, clones with trilineage differentiation capacity exhibited enhanced vascular interaction gene sets, whereas non-differentiating clones were uniquely CD317 positive with significantly enriched immunomodulatory transcriptional networks and high IL-7 production. IL-7 lineage tracing and CD317 immunolocalization confirmed the existence of a rare non-differentiating BMSC subtype, distinct from Cxcl12-DsRed+ perivascular stromal cells in vivo. Colony-forming CD317+ IL-7hi cells, identified at \u223c1%-3% frequency in heterogeneous human BMSC fractions, were found to have the same biomolecular profile as non-differentiating BMSC clones using Raman spectroscopy. Distinct functional identities can be assigned to BMSC subpopulations, which are likely to have specific roles in immune control, lymphopoiesis, and bone homeostasis.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antigens, CD", "Bone Marrow Cells", "Cell Differentiation", "Cell Lineage", "Cell Tracking", "Cells, Cultured", "Chemokine CXCL12", "Cluster Analysis", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Humans", "Interleukin-7", "Mesenchymal Stromal Cells", "Phenotype", "Principal Component Analysis", "Spectrum Analysis, Raman", "Telomerase", "Transcriptome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930894731", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"], ["Developmental Biology", "BIOC", "1309"], ["Cell Biology", "BIOC", "1307"]], "AuthorData": {"56789477300": {"Name": "James S.", "AuthorID": "56789477300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "55458918700": {"Name": "Fox J.", "AuthorID": "55458918700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "7801410032": {"Name": "Afsari F.", "AuthorID": "7801410032", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "56681233300": {"Name": "Lee J.", "AuthorID": "56681233300", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "56680857900": {"Name": "Clough S.", "AuthorID": "56680857900", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "56680713700": {"Name": "Knight C.", "AuthorID": "56680713700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "57202657181": {"Name": "Ashmore J.", "AuthorID": "57202657181", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "35476163100": {"Name": "Ashton P.", "AuthorID": "35476163100", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "56681109900": {"Name": "Preham O.", "AuthorID": "56681109900", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "26643204500": {"Name": "Coles M.", "AuthorID": "26643204500", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "6603917054": {"Name": "Genever P.", "AuthorID": "6603917054", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, University of York"}, "6603095961": {"Name": "Hoogduijn M.", "AuthorID": "6603095961", "AffiliationID": "60032114", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus Medical Centre"}, "56134743700": {"Name": "Ponzoni R.", "AuthorID": "56134743700", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of York"}, "23990564500": {"Name": "Hancock Y.", "AuthorID": "23990564500", "AffiliationID": "60016418", "AffiliationName": "York Centre for Complex Systems Analysis, University of York"}}}
