All rights reserved.The aim of this work was to compare and contrast the mechanical properties and physical stabilities of oral films prepared with either thermal ink-jet printing (TIJP) or solvent casting (SC). Clonidine hydrochloride was selected as a model drug because of its low therapeutic dose and films were prepared using cellulose polymers. Mechanical testing showed that the printed films had Young's moduli and tensile strength values similar to the free film, while casted films were significantly more brittle. The drug also appeared to crystallize out of casted films during stress testing whereas printed films remained unchanged. The dissolution behavior of printed and cast films were similar, because of the rapid disintegration of the polymer. The conclusion is that printing resulted in a better film than casting because the drug resided on the film, rather than in the film where it could exert a plasticizing effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Clonidine", "Critical humidity", "Dynamic mechanical analysis", "Oral films", "Thermal ink-jet printing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Oral", "Carboxymethylcellulose Sodium", "Clonidine", "Computer Systems", "Crystallization", "Drug Delivery Systems", "Drug Liberation", "Drug Stability", "Humans", "Polyvinyl Alcohol", "Technology, Pharmaceutical", "Tensile Strength"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943587001", "SubjectAreas": [["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"36020023200": {"Name": "Buanz A.", "AuthorID": "36020023200", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56458891600": {"Name": "Belaunde C.", "AuthorID": "56458891600", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "54584438100": {"Name": "Soutari N.", "AuthorID": "54584438100", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "8446290500": {"Name": "Tuleu C.", "AuthorID": "8446290500", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "56457832800": {"Name": "Gul M.", "AuthorID": "56457832800", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "6602683597": {"Name": "Gaisford S.", "AuthorID": "6602683597", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}}}
