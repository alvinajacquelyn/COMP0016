Rev. Lett. 109, 183601 (2012)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.109.183601 for the calculation of frequency-filtered and time-resolved photon correlations. Our approach is based on an algebraic expansion of the joint steady state of quantum emitter and sensors with respect to the emitter-sensor coupling parameter \u03f5. This allows us to express photon correlations in terms of the open quantum dynamics of the emitting system only and ensures that computation of correlations are independent on the choice of a small value of \u03f5. Moreover, using time-dependent perturbation theory, we are able to express the frequency- and time-resolved second-order photon correlation as the addition of three components, each of which gives insight into the physical processes dominating the correlation at different time scales. We consider a bioinspired vibronic dimer model to illustrate the agreement between the original formulation and our approach.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Coupling parameters", "Different time scale", "Perturbation approach", "Photon correlation", "Physical process", "Quantum dynamics", "Time-dependent perturbation theory", "Time-resolved photons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85059438288", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"56003750400": {"Name": "Holdaway D.", "AuthorID": "56003750400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "57195559415": {"Name": "Notararigo V.", "AuthorID": "57195559415", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "6603420246": {"Name": "Olaya-Castro A.", "AuthorID": "6603420246", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
