Directional wavelets, when convolved with signals on the sphere, can separate the anisotropic filamentary structures which are characteristic of both the CMB and foregrounds. Extending previous component separation methods, which use the frequency, spatial and harmonic signatures of foregrounds to separate them from the cosmological background signal, SILC can additionally use morphological information in the foregrounds and CMB to better localize the cleaning algorithm. We test the method on Planck data and simulations, demonstrating consistency with existing component separation algorithms, and discuss how to optimize the use of morphological information by varying the number of directional wavelets as a function of spatial scale. We find that combining the use of directional and axisymmetric wavelets depending on scale could yield higher quality CMB temperature maps. Our results set the stage for the application of SILC to polarization anisotropies through an extension to spin wavelets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmic background radiation", "Methods: data analysis"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84983371356", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57190816407": {"Name": "Rogers K.K.", "AuthorID": "57190816407", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "23991274600": {"Name": "Peiris H.V.", "AuthorID": "23991274600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55151435200": {"Name": "Leistedt B.", "AuthorID": "55151435200", "AffiliationID": "60021784", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, New York University"}, "22036053000": {"Name": "Pontzen A.", "AuthorID": "22036053000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8559862200": {"Name": "McEwen J.D.", "AuthorID": "8559862200", "AffiliationID": "60084281, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College London"}}}
