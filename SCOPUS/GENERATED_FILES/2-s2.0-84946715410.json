One absorbing mask placed before the sample and a high resolution detector are used to track variations in the beam intensity distribution caused by the sample. Absorption, refraction, and dark-field are retrieved through a multi-Gaussian interpolation of the beam. Standard filtered back projection is used to reconstruct three dimensional maps of the real and imaginary part of the refractive index, and of the dark-field signal. While the method is here demonstrated using synchrotron radiation, its low coherence requirements suggest a possible implementation with laboratory sources.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84946715410", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55320675800": {"Name": "Vittoria F.A.", "AuthorID": "55320675800", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Harwell Oxford Campus"}, "35067989100": {"Name": "Endrizzi M.", "AuthorID": "35067989100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "35733519000": {"Name": "Diemoz P.C.", "AuthorID": "35733519000", "AffiliationID": "109911725", "AffiliationName": "Research Complex at Harwell, Harwell Oxford Campus"}, "56954731500": {"Name": "Zamir A.", "AuthorID": "56954731500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "7004072469": {"Name": "Olivo A.", "AuthorID": "7004072469", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "57203048907": {"Name": "Robinson I.K.", "AuthorID": "57203048907", "AffiliationID": "60175883", "AffiliationName": "London Centre for Nanotechnology"}, "36103067800": {"Name": "Wagner U.H.", "AuthorID": "36103067800", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Oxford Campus"}, "57205077339": {"Name": "Rau C.", "AuthorID": "57205077339", "AffiliationID": "60104663", "AffiliationName": "Diamond Light Source, Harwell Oxford Campus"}}}
