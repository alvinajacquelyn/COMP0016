It is, however, considered a rare event in China, probably because of lack of awareness and limitation of studies in the country. We aimed to provide some initial estimation of the burden of SUDEP in China. Methods We established a large Chinese community-based cohort of people with epilepsy between January 2010 and December 2011. For any participant who died during follow-up, detailed information on cause of death was obtained using a specifically designed Verbal Autopsy Questionnaire. All cases were reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel and reinvestigated if necessary. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy incidence rates were estimated and case details provided. Results The cohort consisted of 1562 people and during a median 5 years follow-up, 72 deaths were reported. The all-causes death incidence was 11.23 (95% CI 8.86\u201314.07) per 1000 person-years. Fifteen died suddenly and unexpectedly in a reasonable state of health in the week preceding death. We recorded detailed information of these 15 deaths. Thirteen were considered to be probable SUDEP and two possible SUDEP. The incidence of probable SUDEP was 2.03 (95% CI 1.13\u20133.38) per 1000 person-years, and the incidence of all suspected (probable and possible) SUDEP was 2.34 (95% CI 1.36\u20133.77) per 1000 person-years. Significance The incidence of SUDEP was relatively high among Chinese people with epilepsy when compared with that in previous community-based studies from high-income countries. The burden of SUDEP in China requires further assessments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Premature mortality", "Seizure", "SUDEP", "Verbal autopsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Asian Continental Ancestry Group", "China", "Cohort Studies", "Death, Sudden", "Epilepsy", "Female", "Humans", "Incidence", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mortality, Premature", "Population Surveillance", "Risk Factors", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029817269", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"], ["Behavioral Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2802"]], "AuthorData": {"56810185300": {"Name": "Ge Y.", "AuthorID": "56810185300", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "35331652300": {"Name": "Ding D.", "AuthorID": "35331652300", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training in Neurosciences, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "7201414497": {"Name": "Hong Z.", "AuthorID": "7201414497", "AffiliationID": "60073628, 60009860", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training in Neurosciences, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University"}, "55241899100": {"Name": "Zhang Q.", "AuthorID": "55241899100", "AffiliationID": "109481064", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Ningxia Medical University Affiliated Hospital"}, "55584795104": {"Name": "Yang B.", "AuthorID": "55584795104", "AffiliationID": "100746535", "AffiliationName": "Jiaozuo People's Hospital"}, "56135245500": {"Name": "Wang T.", "AuthorID": "56135245500", "AffiliationID": "119365725", "AffiliationName": "Jincheng Emergency Center"}, "53880065700": {"Name": "Li B.", "AuthorID": "53880065700", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Forensic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine, Fudan University"}, "57206676398": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "57206676398", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Human Anatomy and Histoembryology, School of Basic Medicine, Fudan University"}, "55482565200": {"Name": "Luo J.", "AuthorID": "55482565200", "AffiliationID": "60009860", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Fudan University"}, "7004369601": {"Name": "Kwan P.", "AuthorID": "7004369601", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Department of Medicine and Neurology, University of Melbourne & Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "57216606865": {"Name": "Wang W.", "AuthorID": "57216606865", "AffiliationID": "60026707, 60069741", "AffiliationName": "Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University"}, "57188659835": {"Name": "Sander J.W.", "AuthorID": "57188659835", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
