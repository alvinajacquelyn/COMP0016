KGaA, WeinheimFast pyrolysis bio-oils possess unfavorable physicochemical properties and poor stability, in large part, owing to the presence of carboxylic acids, which hinders their use as biofuels. Catalytic esterification offers an atom- and energy-efficient route to upgrade pyrolysis bio-oils. Propyl sulfonic acid (PrSO3H) silicas are active for carboxylic acid esterification but suffer mass-transport limitations for bulky substrates. The incorporation of macropores (200 nm) enhances the activity of mesoporous SBA-15 architectures (post-functionalized by hydrothermal saline-promoted grafting) for the esterification of linear carboxylic acids, with the magnitude of the turnover frequency (TOF) enhancement increasing with carboxylic acid chain length from 5 % (C3) to 110 % (C12). Macroporous\u2013mesoporous PrSO3H/SBA-15 also provides a two-fold TOF enhancement over its mesoporous analogue for the esterification of a real, thermal fast-pyrolysis bio-oil derived from woodchips. The total acid number was reduced by 57 %, as determined by GC\u00d7GC\u2013time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC\u00d7GC\u2013ToFMS), which indicated ester and ether formation accompanying the loss of acid, phenolic, aldehyde, and ketone components.", "AuthorKeywords": ["acidity", "bio-oil", "esterification", "mesoporous silica", "sulfonic acid"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acid esterification", "Bio oil", "Catalytic esterification", "Fast pyrolysis bio-oil", "Mass transport limitation", "Mesoporous Silica", "Sulfonic acid", "Time of flight mass spectrometry", "Biofuels", "Carboxylic Acids", "Catalysis", "Esterification", "Kinetics", "Porosity", "Silicon Dioxide", "Sulfonic Acids", "Temperature"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029152938", "SubjectAreas": [["Environmental Chemistry", "ENVI", "2304"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"]], "AuthorData": {"56035830400": {"Name": "Manayil J.C.", "AuthorID": "56035830400", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "53980431800": {"Name": "Osatiashtiani A.", "AuthorID": "53980431800", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "57213908070": {"Name": "Mendoza A.", "AuthorID": "57213908070", "AffiliationID": "60018940", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemical and Energy Technology, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos"}, "37119172200": {"Name": "Parlett C.M.A.", "AuthorID": "37119172200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "55771300200": {"Name": "Isaacs M.A.", "AuthorID": "55771300200", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "55758702600": {"Name": "Durndell L.J.", "AuthorID": "55758702600", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7405628120": {"Name": "Lee A.F.", "AuthorID": "7405628120", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "7403725899": {"Name": "Wilson K.", "AuthorID": "7403725899", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "European Bioenergy Research Institute, Aston University"}, "15760422800": {"Name": "Michailof C.", "AuthorID": "15760422800", "AffiliationID": "60026208", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Process & Energy Resources Institute, Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas (CPERI/CERTH)"}, "57184007300": {"Name": "Heracleous E.", "AuthorID": "57184007300", "AffiliationID": "60026208", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Process & Energy Resources Institute, Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas (CPERI/CERTH)"}, "7006532406": {"Name": "Lappas A.", "AuthorID": "7006532406", "AffiliationID": "60026208", "AffiliationName": "Chemical Process & Energy Resources Institute, Centre for Research and Technology-Hellas (CPERI/CERTH)"}}}
