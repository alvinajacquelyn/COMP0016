This study aims to investigate the relationship between growth and sex hormone levels and breast tissue composition in young nulliparous women. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 415 young (age 21.5 years) nulliparous women from an English prebirth cohort underwent a MRI examination of their breasts to estimate percent-water (a proxy for mammographic percent density) and provided a blood sample to measure plasma levels of growth factors (insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor-II, insulin growth factor-binding protein-3, growth hormone) and, if not on hormonal contraception (n = 117) sex hormones (dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, testosterone, estrone, estadiol, sex hormone\u2013 binding globulin, prolactin). Testosterone (n = 330) and sex hormone\u2013binding globulin (n = 318) were also measured at age 15.5 years. Regression models were used to estimate the relative difference (RD) in percent-water associated with one SD increment in hormone levels. Results: Estradiol at age 21.5 and sex hormone\u2013binding globulin at age 21.5 were positively associated with body mass index (BMI)-adjusted percent-water [RD (95% confidence interval (CI)): 3% (0%\u20137%) and 3% (1%\u20135%), respectively]. There was a positive nonlinear association between androstenedione at age 21.5 and percent-water. Insulin-like growth factor-I and growth hormone at age 21.5 were also positively associated with BMI-adjusted percent-water [RD (95% CI):2% (0%\u20134%) and 4% (1%\u20137%), respectively]. Conclusions: The findings suggest that endogenous hormones affect breast tissue composition in young nulliparous women. Impact: The well-established associations of childhood growth and development with breast cancer risk may be partly mediated by the role of endogenous hormones on breast tissue composition.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Breast", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Female", "Growth Hormone", "Humans", "Parity", "Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057711140", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"55605020400": {"Name": "Denholm R.", "AuthorID": "55605020400", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7003647992": {"Name": "Dos-Santos-Silva I.", "AuthorID": "7003647992", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7004622714": {"Name": "De Stavola B.L.", "AuthorID": "7004622714", "AffiliationID": "60012662, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Population, Policy and Practice Programme, UCL, Institute of Child Health"}, "6602192523": {"Name": "Hipwell J.H.", "AuthorID": "6602192523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, UCL"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.J.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Bioengineering, UCL"}, "7005584633": {"Name": "Doran S.J.", "AuthorID": "7005584633", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60012754, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cancer Imaging Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "56562511600": {"Name": "Leach M.O.", "AuthorID": "56562511600", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60012754, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK Cancer Imaging Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7102662382": {"Name": "Holly J.M.P.", "AuthorID": "7102662382", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "IGFs and Metabolic Endocrinology Group, School of Translational Health Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Bristol"}, "6603595276": {"Name": "Folkerd E.", "AuthorID": "6603595276", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Institute of Cancer Research"}, "36041337100": {"Name": "Dowsett M.", "AuthorID": "36041337100", "AffiliationID": "60010337, 60017166", "AffiliationName": "Ralph Lauren Centre for Breast Cancer Research, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Institute of Cancer Research"}}}
