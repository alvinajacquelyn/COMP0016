However, the use of the fast-track pathway may vary for different patient groups.Methods:We examined data from 669 220 patients with 35 cancers diagnosed in 2006-2010 following either fast-track or 'routine' primary-to-secondary care referrals using 'Routes to Diagnosis' data. We estimated the proportion of fast-track referrals by sociodemographic characteristic and cancer site and used logistic regression to estimate respective crude and adjusted odds ratios. We additionally explored whether sociodemographic associations varied by cancer.Results:There were large variations in the odds of fast-track referral by cancer (P<0.001). Patients with testicular and breast cancer were most likely to have been diagnosed after a fast-track referral (adjusted odds ratios 2.73 and 2.35, respectively, using rectal cancer as reference); whereas patients with brain cancer and leukaemias least likely (adjusted odds ratios 0.05 and 0.09, respectively, for brain cancer and acute myeloid leukaemia). There were sex, age and deprivation differences in the odds of fast-track referral (P<0.013) that varied in their size and direction for patients with different cancers (P<0.001). For example, fast-track referrals were least likely in younger women with endometrial cancer and in older men with testicular cancer.Conclusions:Fast-track referrals are less likely for cancers characterised by nonspecific presenting symptoms and patients belonging to low cancer incidence demographic groups. Interventions beyond clinical guidelines for 'alarm' symptoms are needed to improve diagnostic timeliness.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cancer diagnosis", "cancer epidemiology", "diagnostic pathway", "early diagnosis", "primary care"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Early Detection of Cancer", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Neoplasms", "Odds Ratio", "Referral and Consultation", "Regression Analysis", "Sex Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85040374233", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Cancer Research", "BIOC", "1306"]], "AuthorData": {"56166689900": {"Name": "Zhou Y.", "AuthorID": "56166689900", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "57156102700": {"Name": "Mendonca S.C.", "AuthorID": "57156102700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "7103067740": {"Name": "Walter F.M.", "AuthorID": "7103067740", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Cambridge Centre for Health Services Research, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "6603557582": {"Name": "Lyratzopoulos G.", "AuthorID": "6603557582", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Behavioural Science and Health, University College London"}, "57202757335": {"Name": "Abel G.A.", "AuthorID": "57202757335", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School (Primary Care), St Luke's Campus"}, "55031252700": {"Name": "Hamilton W.", "AuthorID": "55031252700", "AffiliationID": "60111707", "AffiliationName": "University of Exeter Medical School (Primary Care), St Luke's Campus"}, "57191496301": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "57191496301", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60115291", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England Zone A"}, "55387932300": {"Name": "Elliss-Brookes L.", "AuthorID": "55387932300", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60115291", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England Zone A"}, "55560369400": {"Name": "McPhail S.", "AuthorID": "55560369400", "AffiliationID": "60111140, 60115291", "AffiliationName": "National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service, Public Health England Zone A"}, "51764567500": {"Name": "Shelton J.", "AuthorID": "51764567500", "AffiliationID": "60012754", "AffiliationName": "Cancer Research UK"}}}
