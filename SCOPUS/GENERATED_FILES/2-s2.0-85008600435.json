Unfortunately, this has led to the development of resistance to the compounds in many species. The mode of action of pyrethroids is known to be via interactions with the voltage-gated sodium channel. Understanding how binding to the channel is affected by amino acid substitutions that give rise to resistance has helped to elucidate the mode of action of the compounds and the molecular basis of their selectivity for insects vs mammals and between insects and other arthropods. Modelling of the channel/pyrethroid interactions, coupled with the ability to express mutant channels in oocytes and study function, has led to knowledge of both how the channels function and potentially how to design novel insecticides with greater species selectivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Insecticides", "Mode of action", "Modelling", "Pyrethroids", "Resistance"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Insect Proteins", "Insecticides", "Pyrethrins", "Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel Agonists"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008600435", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"]], "AuthorData": {"7203030239": {"Name": "Field L.M.", "AuthorID": "7203030239", "AffiliationID": "60002793", "AffiliationName": "Rothamsted Research"}, "57192891460": {"Name": "Emyr Davies T.G.", "AuthorID": "57192891460", "AffiliationID": "60002793", "AffiliationName": "Rothamsted Research"}, "55664861400": {"Name": "Williamson M.S.", "AuthorID": "55664861400", "AffiliationID": "60002793", "AffiliationName": "Rothamsted Research"}, "7202576274": {"Name": "Wallace B.A.", "AuthorID": "7202576274", "AffiliationID": "60009016", "AffiliationName": "Birkbeck College, University of London"}, "57192893737": {"Name": "O\u2019Reilly A.O.", "AuthorID": "57192893737", "AffiliationID": "60028355", "AffiliationName": "Liverpool John Moores University"}}}
