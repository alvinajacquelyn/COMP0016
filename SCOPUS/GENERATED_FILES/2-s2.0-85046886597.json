In defending a utopian orientation on the part of HE lecturers, we develop the notion of \u2018minimal utopianism\u2019; a notion which, we suggest, expresses the difficult position of critical educators concerned to offer their students the tools with which to imagine and explore alternatives to current social and political reality, while acknowledging the contingent ethical constraints of the system within which they and their students are working. While agreeing with utopian theorists such as Darren Webb who have defended the need for \u2018blueprint utopias\u2019 in education in the face of the reduction of the idea of utopia to a purely process-oriented pedagogy, our focus here is on the prior educational task of providing the conceptual and communicative tools for utopian thinking to emerge. The collaborative nature of this paper is reflected in the interdisciplinary sources on which we draw in developing our ideas, including moral philosophy, literary theory, political philosophy, anarchist theory and utopian studies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["anarchism", "assessment", "higher education", "pedagogy", "Utopia"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046886597", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"56594797600": {"Name": "Bojesen E.", "AuthorID": "56594797600", "AffiliationID": "60003310", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education Studies, University of Winchester"}, "57203671809": {"Name": "Suissa J.", "AuthorID": "57203671809", "AffiliationID": "60006242", "AffiliationName": "Department of Education, Practice and Society, UCL Institute of Education"}}}
