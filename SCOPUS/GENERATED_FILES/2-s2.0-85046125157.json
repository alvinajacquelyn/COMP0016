Most of these components do not bind the cargo. Here, we show that such \"inert\" components can be crucial for the precise control of cross-membrane trafficking. Using a statistical mechanics model and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of inert membrane components of small isotropic curvatures dramatically influences cargo endocytosis, even if the total spontaneous curvature of such a membrane remains unchanged. Curved lipids, such as cholesterol, as well as asymmetrically included proteins and tethered sugars can, therefore, actively participate in the control of the membrane trafficking of nanoscopic cargo. We find that even a low-level expression of curved inert membrane components can determine the membrane selectivity toward the cargo size and can be used to selectively target membranes of certain compositions. Our results suggest a robust and general method of controlling cargo trafficking by adjusting the membrane composition without needing to alter the concentration of receptors or the average membrane curvature. This study indicates that cells can prepare for any trafficking event by incorporating curved inert components in either of the membrane leaflets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Endocytosis", "exocytosis", "membrane curvature", "membrane trafficking", "nanoparticles", "virus uptake"], "IndexKeywords": ["Geometrical property", "Membrane components", "Membrane composition", "Membrane selectivity", "Membrane trafficking", "Molecular dynamics simulations", "Small concentration", "Spontaneous curvature", "Animals", "Cell Membrane", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Cholesterol", "Endocytosis", "Exocytosis", "Humans", "Membrane Proteins", "Models, Biological", "Molecular Dynamics Simulation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85046125157", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Chemistry (all)", "CHEM", "1600"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"]], "AuthorData": {"37360948900": {"Name": "Curk T.", "AuthorID": "37360948900", "AffiliationID": "60004060", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, University of Maribor"}, "6602908375": {"Name": "Dobnikar J.", "AuthorID": "6602908375", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "56394589600": {"Name": "Wirnsberger P.", "AuthorID": "56394589600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "7005702293": {"Name": "Frenkel D.", "AuthorID": "7005702293", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge"}, "23669259400": {"Name": "\u0160ari\u0107 A.", "AuthorID": "23669259400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Institute for the Physics of Living Systems, University College London"}}}
