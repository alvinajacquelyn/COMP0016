This paper aims at comparing the accuracy of low-cost 3D scanning technologies with the significantly more expensive state-of-the-art 3D commercial scanners in the context of breast 3D reconstruction. We present results from 28 synthetic and clinical RGBD sequences, including 12 unique patients and an anthropomorphic phantom demonstrating the applicability of low-cost RGBD sensors to real clinical cases. Body deformation and homogeneous skin texture pose challenges to the studied reconstruction systems. Although these should be addressed appropriately if higher model quality is warranted, we observe that low-cost sensors are able to obtain valuable reconstructions comparable to the state-of-the-art within an error margin of 3 mm.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Aesthetic evaluation", "Breast cancer", "Depth cameras"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aesthetic evaluation", "Anthropomorphic phantoms", "Breast Cancer", "Comparative studies", "Depth camera", "Different treatments", "Reconstruction systems", "Reconstruction techniques"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85029508049", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"57038767300": {"Name": "Lacher R.M.", "AuthorID": "57038767300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "47862298300": {"Name": "Vasconcelos F.", "AuthorID": "47862298300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "35464300200": {"Name": "Hawkes D.J.", "AuthorID": "35464300200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "6602192523": {"Name": "Hipwell J.H.", "AuthorID": "6602192523", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57203105770": {"Name": "Stoyanov D.", "AuthorID": "57203105770", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "57195677554": {"Name": "Bishop D.C.", "AuthorID": "57195677554", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Medical Photography, Royal Free, University College Medical School"}, "7402771456": {"Name": "Williams N.R.", "AuthorID": "7402771456", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Surgical and Interventional Trials Unit, University College London"}, "12544574800": {"Name": "Keshtgar M.", "AuthorID": "12544574800", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Royal Free London Foundation Trust"}}}
