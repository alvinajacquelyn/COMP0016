In this second part, we will discuss the role of image-derived quantitative parameters from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in gastric cancer, as both techniques have been shown to be promising and useful tools in the clinical decision making of this disease. We will focus on different aspects including aggressiveness assessment, staging and Lauren type discrimination, prognosis prediction and response evaluation. Although both the number of articles and the patients enrolled in the studies were rather small, there is evidence that quantitative parameters from DCE-MRI such as Ktrans, Ve, Kep and AUC could be promising image-derived surrogate parameters for the management of gastric cancer. Data from 18F-FDG PET/CT studies showed that standardised uptake value (SUV) is significantly associated with the aggressiveness, treatment response and prognosis of this disease. Along with the results from diffusion-weighted MRI and contrast-enhanced multidetector computed tomography presented in Part 1 of this critical review, there are additional image-derived quantitative parameters from DCE-MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT that hold promise as effective tools in the diagnostic pathway of gastric cancer. Key Points: \u2022 Quantitative analysis from DCE-MRI and18F-FDG PET/CT allows the extrapolation of multiple image-derived parameters. \u2022 Data from DCE-MRI (Ktrans, Ve, Kep and AUC) and 18F-FDG PET/CT (SUV) are non-invasive, quantitative image-derived parameters that hold promise in the evaluation of the aggressiveness, treatment response and prognosis of gastric cancer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomarkers", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Positron emission tomography", "Quantitative parameters", "Stomach neoplasms"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Contrast Media", "Female", "Fluorodeoxyglucose F18", "Humans", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography", "Prognosis", "Stomach Neoplasms"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070456694", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"]], "AuthorData": {"7402080963": {"Name": "Tang L.", "AuthorID": "7402080963", "AffiliationID": "60008510, 60124575", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Radiology, Peking University Cancer Hospital"}, "55266779300": {"Name": "Wang X.J.", "AuthorID": "55266779300", "AffiliationID": "60008510, 60124575", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University Cancer Hospital"}, "35401974700": {"Name": "Baba H.", "AuthorID": "35401974700", "AffiliationID": "60162105, 60021120", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University"}, "55646665800": {"Name": "Giganti F.", "AuthorID": "55646665800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University College London"}}}
