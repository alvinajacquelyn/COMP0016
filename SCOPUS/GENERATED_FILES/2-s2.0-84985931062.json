KGaA, WeinheimA series of new near-infrared (NIR) emitting copolymers, based on a low band gap 6-(2-butyloctyl)-4,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,3]triazolo[4\u2032,5\u2032:4,5]benzo[1,2-c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole (TBTTT) fluorophore copolymerized into a high band gap poly[3,3\u2032-ditetradecyl-2,2\u2032-bithiophene-5,5\u2032-diyl-alt-5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione-1,3-diyl] (P2TTPD) host backbone, for polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) applications is reported. PLEDs fabricated from the host polymer (P2TTPD-0) show external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 0.49% at 690 nm, with turn-on voltage (Von) at only 2.4 V. By incorporating the TBTTT segments into the host polymer backbone, pure NIR emission peaking at ca. 900 nm is obtained with Von remaining below 5 V. This work demonstrates that such a low Von can be attributed to efficient intrachain energy and/or charge transfer to the TBTTT sites. When the NIR emitting copolymer (P2TTPD-10) is blended with P2TTPD-0, the TBTTT are confined to well-separated polymer chains. As a result, the EQE from the blend is lower and the Von higher than that obtained from the pure copolymer (P2TTPD-1.0) with equal content of TBTTT. An analogous copolymer (P4T-1.0), consisting of poly[3,3\u2032-ditetradecyl-2,2\u2032:5\u2032,2\u2032\u2032:5\u2032\u2032,2\u2032\u2032\u2032-quaterthiophene-5,5\u2032\u2032\u2032-diyl] (P4T) as the host and 1% TBTTT as the NIR emitter, further demonstrates that pure NIR emission can be obtained only through optimized molecular orbital energy levels, as in P2TTPD-1.0, which minimizes chances for either charge trapping or exciton splitting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["conjugated polymers", "emission", "fluorescent materials", "near-infrared", "OLEDs"], "IndexKeywords": ["External quantum efficiency", "Fluorescent materials", "Molecular orbital energy", "Near Infrared", "Near-infrared emissions", "OLEDs", "Polymer light emitting diode", "Polymer light-emitting diodes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84985931062", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57191035869": {"Name": "Murto P.", "AuthorID": "57191035869", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering/Applied Chemistry, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "55706284200": {"Name": "Xu X.", "AuthorID": "55706284200", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering/Applied Chemistry, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "15046143300": {"Name": "Wang E.", "AuthorID": "15046143300", "AffiliationID": "60000990", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering/Applied Chemistry, Chalmers University of Technology"}, "55840747800": {"Name": "Minotto A.", "AuthorID": "55840747800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55543112000": {"Name": "Zampetti A.", "AuthorID": "55543112000", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7402879628": {"Name": "Andersson M.R.", "AuthorID": "7402879628", "AffiliationID": "60031846", "AffiliationName": "Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia"}}}
