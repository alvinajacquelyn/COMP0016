In the caption of Figure 2, we stated that \u201cF and p values indicate the significance of a phylogenetic ANCOVA testing for intercept differences between humans and other primates (see also Smaers and Rohlf [9], Supplemental Information\u2026, and Table S2 for more detailed results)\u201d (p. 716). We would like to clarify that in this statement, \u201csee also Smaers and Rohlf\u201d refers, specifically and exclusively, to the phylogenetic ANCOVA of primate prefrontal cortex to primary visual cortex and frontal motor areas using the Smaers dataset in [9]. These results were depicted in a subsection of our Figure 2 (the two top left regression plots) and were numerically presented in a subsection of our Table S2. Smaers and Rohlf presented these results as an empirical example when describing the least-squares solution of phylogenetic ANCOVA and did not discuss the wider biological implications of these results for primate brain evolution. The presentation of the previous results was discussed openly during the review process of this manuscript.
