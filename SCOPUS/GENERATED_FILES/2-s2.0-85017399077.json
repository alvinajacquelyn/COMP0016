Following the large short- term effects, we now find that the program effects persist, increasing formal participation and earnings contributions to social security and working in larger firms. By using a large administrative source we are also able to establish that the program improved both male and female labor market outcomes by a similar amount-a result that was not apparent with the smaller evaluation sample. The results point to a cost-effective approach to reducing informality and improving labor market outcomes in the long run.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85017399077", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics, Econometrics and Finance (all)", "ECON", "2000"]], "AuthorData": {"6603862452": {"Name": "Attanasio O.", "AuthorID": "6603862452", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University College London"}, "57193885558": {"Name": "Guar\u00edn A.", "AuthorID": "57193885558", "AffiliationID": "60087047", "AffiliationName": "Banco de la Rep\u00fablica"}, "55496140200": {"Name": "Medina C.", "AuthorID": "55496140200", "AffiliationID": "60087047", "AffiliationName": "Banco de la Rep\u00fablica"}, "6601965693": {"Name": "Meghir C.", "AuthorID": "6601965693", "AffiliationID": "60005455", "AffiliationName": "Yale University"}}}
