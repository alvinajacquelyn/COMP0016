However, inpatient populations present with complex needs and usually are admitted only briefly. This makes the delivery of psychological therapies for people experiencing psychosis particularly challenging. Our aim was to explore the adaptations required to deliver psychological therapies to this population from the perspective of inpatient psychological practitioners. Twelve participants were recruited, and a qualitative semistructured interview schedule was administered examining their perspectives on important factors required to deliver psychological interventions in this context. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Three superordinate themes were identified: \u201ccrisis-focused psychological approaches,\u201d \u201cworking with and supporting the wider system,\u201d and \u201cenvironmental adaptations.\u201d Traditional psychological therapies are a challenge to deliver in inpatient environments due to complex needs, essentiality of team working, and brief admission. Several adaptations are required to ensure psychological therapy is effective in this setting.", "AuthorKeywords": ["hospitals", "psychiatric inpatient", "psychological therapy", "psychology", "qualitative", "semi-structured interviews; London"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Cognitive Behavioral Therapy", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "Male", "Psychiatric Department, Hospital", "Psychology, Clinical", "Psychotherapy", "Psychotic Disorders"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064930150", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"7202513618": {"Name": "Wood L.", "AuthorID": "7202513618", "AffiliationID": "60001359", "AffiliationName": "University of Essex"}, "57190061236": {"Name": "Billings J.", "AuthorID": "57190061236", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "7406331085": {"Name": "Johnson S.", "AuthorID": "7406331085", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "57204051806": {"Name": "Williams C.", "AuthorID": "57204051806", "AffiliationID": "60107401", "AffiliationName": "North East London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
