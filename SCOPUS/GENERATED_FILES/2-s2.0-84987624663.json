The asymptotic form of the vacuum solutions to the linearised Einstein\u2013Maxwell field equations is found and the possibility of matching this vacuum to the slow rotating Garc\u00eda metric is considered. We show that, contrary to the case of zero cosmological constant, this Garc\u00eda metric can be matched to an asymptotically de Sitter vacuum in the slow rotation limit. We conclude the Garc\u00eda metric may potentially be suitable for describing a charged isolated rotating body in a cosmological background.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Charge", "Cosmological constant", "Slow rotating", "Stellar solutions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84987624663", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (miscellaneous)", "PHYS", "3101"]], "AuthorData": {"55015594800": {"Name": "Wright M.", "AuthorID": "55015594800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
