Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.We present the first application of a new foreground removal pipeline to the current leading HI intensity mapping data set, obtained by the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). We study the 15- and 1-h-field data of the GBT observations previously presented in Mausui et al. and Switzer et al., covering about 41 deg2 at 0.6 < z < 1.0, for which cross-correlations may be measured with the galaxy distribution of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. In the presented pipeline, we subtract the Galactic foreground continuum and the point-source contamination using an independent component analysis technique (FASTICA), and develop a Fourier-based optimal estimator to compute the temperature power spectrum of the intensity maps and cross-correlation with the galaxy survey data. We show that FASTICA is a reliable tool to subtract diffuse and point-source emission through the non-Gaussian nature of their probability distributions. The temperature power spectra of the intensity maps are dominated by instrumental noise on small scales which FASTICA, as a conservative subtraction technique of non-Gaussian signals, cannot mitigate. However, we determine similar GBT-WiggleZ cross-correlation measurements to those obtained by the singular value decomposition (SVD) method, and confirm that foreground subtraction with FASTICA is robust against 21 cm signal loss, as seen by the converged amplitude of these cross-correlation measurements. We conclude that SVD and FASTICA are complementary methods to investigate the foregrounds and noise systematics present in intensity mapping data sets.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cosmology: observations", "Largescale structure of Universe", "Methods: data analysis", "Methods: statistical", "Radio lines: galaxies"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014865830", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"55359404900": {"Name": "Wolz L.", "AuthorID": "55359404900", "AffiliationID": "60025709, 60170546", "AffiliationName": "ARC Centre of Excellence for All-Sky Astrophysics (CAASTRO), School of Physics, The University of Sydney"}, "7102960950": {"Name": "Blake C.", "AuthorID": "7102960950", "AffiliationID": "60030804", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology"}, "15841786900": {"Name": "Abdalla F.B.", "AuthorID": "15841786900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "56390864300": {"Name": "Anderson C.J.", "AuthorID": "56390864300", "AffiliationID": "60032179", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin - Madison"}, "55822759600": {"Name": "Chang T.C.", "AuthorID": "55822759600", "AffiliationID": "60091990, 60016969", "AffiliationName": "Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics"}, "55750802200": {"Name": "Li Y.C.", "AuthorID": "55750802200", "AffiliationID": "60014205, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}, "35867827700": {"Name": "Masui K.W.", "AuthorID": "35867827700", "AffiliationID": "60082875", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Institute for Advanced Research, CIFAR Program in Cosmology and Gravity"}, "18042803600": {"Name": "Switzer E.", "AuthorID": "18042803600", "AffiliationID": "60006337", "AffiliationName": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center"}, "7005890052": {"Name": "Pen U.L.", "AuthorID": "7005890052", "AffiliationID": "60017159", "AffiliationName": "Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics"}, "55556965900": {"Name": "Voytek T.C.", "AuthorID": "55556965900", "AffiliationID": "60010499", "AffiliationName": "Astrophysics and Cosmology Research Unit, School of Chemistry and Physics, University of KwaZulu-Natal"}, "9745680900": {"Name": "Yadav J.", "AuthorID": "9745680900", "AffiliationID": "60114061, 60029284", "AffiliationName": "Sri Aurobindo College, University of Delhi"}}}
