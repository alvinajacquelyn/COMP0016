This necessitated preparing a sample enriched in Cd114. A subtle, but significant, anisotropy in the thermal expansion of the lattice parameters for CdTiO3 associated with the transition to the polar structure was observed. First-principles calculations are presented to understand energies, phonon dispersion, and structures of possible phases with different symmetries.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85039751091", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"55749015900": {"Name": "Kennedy B.", "AuthorID": "55749015900", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "7402700600": {"Name": "Zhou Q.", "AuthorID": "7402700600", "AffiliationID": "60025709", "AffiliationName": "School of Chemistry, University of Sydney"}, "57192905855": {"Name": "Zhao S.", "AuthorID": "57192905855", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, International Centre for Quantum and Molecular Structures, Shanghai University"}, "57194051264": {"Name": "Jia F.", "AuthorID": "57194051264", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, International Centre for Quantum and Molecular Structures, Shanghai University"}, "56708031800": {"Name": "Ren W.", "AuthorID": "56708031800", "AffiliationID": "60023813", "AffiliationName": "Physics Department, International Centre for Quantum and Molecular Structures, Shanghai University"}, "7202745497": {"Name": "Knight K.", "AuthorID": "7202745497", "AffiliationID": "60025352", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, Natural History Museum"}}}
