Domestic pigs underwent three cycles of 10/10 min r-I/R by percutaneous intracoronary balloon inflation/deflation in the mid left anterior descending artery, without consecutive MI. Sham interventions (n = 8) served as controls. Hearts were explanted at 5 h (n = 6) and 24 h (n = 6), and transcriptomic profiling of the distal (ischemia-affected) and proximal (non-affected) anterior myocardial regions were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) and post-processing with signaling pathway impact and pathway network analyses. In ischemic region, r-I/R induced early activation of Ca-, adipocytokine and insulin signaling pathways with key regulator STAT3, which was also upregulated in the remote areas together with clusterin (CLU) and TNF-alpha. During the late phase of cardioprotection, antigen immunomodulatory pathways were activated with upregulation of STAT1 and CASP3 and downregulation of neprilysin in both zones, suggesting r-I/R induced intrinsic remote conditioning. The temporo-spatially differently activated pathways revealed a global myocardial response, and neprilysin and the STAT family as key regulators of intrinsic remote conditioning for prevention of adverse remodeling.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Computational Biology", "Disease Models, Animal", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Gene Regulatory Networks", "High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing", "Ischemia", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury", "Neprilysin", "Physical Conditioning, Animal", "Signal Transduction", "STAT1 Transcription Factor", "STAT3 Transcription Factor", "Sus scrofa", "Ventricular Remodeling"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014897998", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14065082800": {"Name": "Pavo N.", "AuthorID": "14065082800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56880131600": {"Name": "Lukovic D.", "AuthorID": "56880131600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "56829394600": {"Name": "Zlabinger K.", "AuthorID": "56829394600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "57191629752": {"Name": "Zimba A.", "AuthorID": "57191629752", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "25924899200": {"Name": "Goliasch G.", "AuthorID": "25924899200", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55605779390": {"Name": "Winkler J.", "AuthorID": "55605779390", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55606327600": {"Name": "Maurer G.", "AuthorID": "55606327600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004704717": {"Name": "Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si M.", "AuthorID": "7004704717", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "37761910300": {"Name": "Lorant D.", "AuthorID": "37761910300", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Anaesthesiology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55897547600": {"Name": "Auer K.", "AuthorID": "55897547600", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstretrics and Gynecology - Molecular Oncology Group, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6508196144": {"Name": "Pils D.", "AuthorID": "6508196144", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "CeMSIIS, Center for Medical Statistics, Informatics, and Intelligent Systems, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6504040937": {"Name": "Jan Ankersmit H.", "AuthorID": "6504040937", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6506196778": {"Name": "Giricz Z.", "AuthorID": "6506196778", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Semmelweis University"}, "36655461600": {"Name": "Baranyai T.", "AuthorID": "36655461600", "AffiliationID": "60024812", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapy, Semmelweis University"}, "7006126478": {"Name": "Ferdinandy P.", "AuthorID": "7006126478", "AffiliationID": "60116252", "AffiliationName": "Pharmahungary Group"}, "55485818100": {"Name": "S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy M.", "AuthorID": "55485818100", "AffiliationID": "60068464, 60027332", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Szeged"}, "36473494400": {"Name": "Jakab A.", "AuthorID": "36473494400", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Imaging and Image-guided Therapy, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6506437714": {"Name": "Garamv\u00f6lgyi R.", "AuthorID": "6506437714", "AffiliationID": "60008613", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Diagnostic Imaging and Radiation Oncology, University of Kaposvar"}, "20734222100": {"Name": "Emmert M.", "AuthorID": "20734222100", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital of Zurich"}, "7004435100": {"Name": "Hoerstrup S.", "AuthorID": "7004435100", "AffiliationID": "60019619", "AffiliationName": "Clinic for Cardiovascular Surgery, University Hospital of Zurich"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60095034", "AffiliationName": "Cardiovascular and Metabolic Disorders Program, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School"}}}
