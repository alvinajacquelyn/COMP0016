To do this, mitochondria utilize the electrochemical potential across their inner membrane (\u0394\u03a8m) to sequester Ca2+. The influx of Ca2+ into the mitochondria stimulates three rate-limiting dehydrogenases of the citric acid cycle, increasing electron transfer through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes. This stimulation maintains \u0394\u03a8m, which is temporarily dissipated as the positive calcium ions cross the mitochondrial inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix. We describe here a method for simultaneously measuring mitochondria Ca2+ uptake and \u0394\u03a8m in live cells using confocal microscopy. By permeabilizing the cells, mitochondrial Ca2+ can be measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4, AM, with measurement of \u0394\u03a8m using the fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester, perchlorate (TMRM). The benefit of this system is that there is very little spectral overlap between the fluorescent dyes, allowing accurate measurement of mitochondrial Ca2+ and \u0394\u03a8m simultaneously. Using the sequential addition of Ca2+ aliquots, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake can be monitored, and the concentration at which Ca2+ induces mitochondrial membrane permeability transition and the loss of \u0394\u03a8m determined.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Calcium", "Cellular biology", "Confocal microscopy", "Fluorescent staining", "Issue 119", "Live cells", "Membrane potential", "Mitochondria"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aniline Compounds", "Calcium", "Cell Line", "Fluorescent Dyes", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Microscopy, Fluorescence", "Mitochondria", "Mitochondrial Membranes", "Rhodamines", "Xanthenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011552317", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Chemical Engineering (all)", "CENG", "1500"], ["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Immunology and Microbiology (all)", "IMMU", "2400"]], "AuthorData": {"57203046716": {"Name": "McKenzie M.", "AuthorID": "57203046716", "AffiliationID": "60019578", "AffiliationName": "The Department of Molecular and Translational Sciences, Monash University"}, "57189575064": {"Name": "Lim S.C.", "AuthorID": "57189575064", "AffiliationID": "60005884", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Genetic Diseases, Hudson Institute of Medical Research"}, "7005847722": {"Name": "Duchen M.R.", "AuthorID": "7005847722", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physiology, University College London"}}}
