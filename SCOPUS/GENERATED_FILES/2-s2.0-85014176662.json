It has tangible clinical importance, being associated with sub-optimal self-care and glycemic control. Diabetes distress has been operationalized in various ways and several measures exist. Measurement clarity is needed for both scientific and clinical reasons. Objectives To clarify the conceptualization and operationalization of diabetes distress, identify and distinguish relevant measures, and evaluate their appropriateness for this purpose. Results Six measures were identified: Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID) scale, Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS); Type I Diabetes Distress Scale (T1-DDS), Diabetes-specific Quality of Life Scale\u2014Revised (DSQoLs-R) \u2018Burden and Restrictions\u2014Daily Hassles\u2019 sub-scale, Well-being Questionnaire 28 (W-BQ 28) \u2018Diabetes Well-being\u2019 sub-scale, and Illness Perceptions Questionnaire\u2014Revised (IPQ-R) \u2018Emotional Representations\u2019 sub-scale. Across these measures a broad spectrum of diabetes distress is captured, including distress associated with treatment regimen, food/eating, future/complications, hypoglycemia, social/interpersonal relationships, and healthcare professionals. No single measure appears fully comprehensive. Limited detail of the qualitative work informing scale design is reported, raising concerns about content validity. Conclusions Across the available measures diabetes distress is seemingly comprehensively assessed and measures should be considered in terms of their focus and scope to ensure the foci of interventions are appropriately targeted.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Conceptual model", "Diabetes distress", "Narrative review", "Patient-reported outcome measures", "Validity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Combined Modality Therapy", "Cost of Illness", "Diabetes Complications", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Humans", "Models, Psychological", "Psychosocial Support Systems", "Quality of Life", "Self-Management", "Stress, Psychological", "Validation Studies as Topic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85014176662", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"55513894900": {"Name": "Dennick K.", "AuthorID": "55513894900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology University College London"}, "13007301100": {"Name": "Sturt J.", "AuthorID": "13007301100", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, Kings College London"}, "35608213900": {"Name": "Speight J.", "AuthorID": "35608213900", "AffiliationID": "112789864", "AffiliationName": "AHP Research"}}}
