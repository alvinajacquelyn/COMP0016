While scholarship on male allies has demonstrated the nature of their transformations and motivations, less attention has been paid to their negotiations of masculinity, privilege, the intersection between subjecthood and social contexts, and how these inform their engagements with women activists\u2019 anti-violence work in their communities. We explore questions of men\u2019s engagement in this article, which is based on a pilot ethnographic study with male allies in a VAWG prevention program in the informal settlements of Dharavi in Mumbai, India. We found that while men are able to acquire \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cawareness\u201d through the intervention, it produces an individuating effect wherein the structural nature of VAWG is obscured due to an emphasis on men\u2019s individual traits. This further informs participants\u2019 understanding of masculinity, which is marked by ambivalence as men negotiate multiple hegemonic masculinities and socioeconomic anxieties. One reason for this is that interventions with men are unable to destabilize public\u2013private boundaries in informal settlements, which continue to treat VAWG as \u201cprivate matters.\u201d We discuss the implications for local and global responses to engender accountability among male allies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["engaging men", "hegemonic masculinity", "male allies", "urban informal settlements", "violence against women and girls", "violence prevention"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85058617900", "SubjectAreas": [["Gender Studies", "SOCI", "3318"], ["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Sociology and Political Science", "SOCI", "3312"], ["Literature and Literary Theory", "ARTS", "1208"]], "AuthorData": {"57195722248": {"Name": "Chakraborty P.", "AuthorID": "57195722248", "AffiliationID": "107958547", "AffiliationName": "Society for Nutrition, Education, SNEHA"}, "30267514600": {"Name": "Daruwalla N.", "AuthorID": "30267514600", "AffiliationID": "107958547", "AffiliationName": "Society for Nutrition, Education, SNEHA"}, "6603217003": {"Name": "Osrin D.", "AuthorID": "6603217003", "AffiliationID": "119049959", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health"}}}
