All Rights Reserved.Theoretical and practical principles of information literacy (IL) are generally embedded into the wider course structure of Library and Information Studies (LIS) Masters programmes. This paper discusses the findings of a qualitative thematic content analysis of library student exam answer texts, which provide a student view of whether it would be appropriate to designate a stand-alone module specifically for the delivery of these principles. The key concepts of IL are currently found embedded within the core programme. It is suggested that the introduction of a distinct module may more appropriately reflect stakeholder requirements, including LIS students\u2019 combined needs as producer-consumers of IL interventions in their study and practice. There is an increasing requirement for them to develop, deliver and evaluate good-practice interventions in the workplace. This work builds on existing discussions around IL as a discipline and the changing role of the librarian. The analysis is substantially informed by the participants\u2019 views. It suggests that while embedding IL in the library school curriculum can address the consumer-IL needs of the participants as students, a more explicit focus will support development of their professional-IL needs.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Academic libraries", "Higher education", "Information literacy", "LIS curriculum development", "Professional frameworks", "Text analysis", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84949459535", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"23570463400": {"Name": "Inskip C.", "AuthorID": "23570463400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, University College London"}}}
