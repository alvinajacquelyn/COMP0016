In this Letter, the authors propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach to overcome this problem, which they refer to it as an anti-noise CSI acquisition network (ANCAN). Results demonstrate that ANCAN can reconstruct CSI more accurately than other emerging CSI acquisition methods in the presence of noisy feedback links.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti noise", "Convolutional neural network", "Downlink channels", "Frequency-division duplexes", "Massive multiple-input- multiple-output system (MIMO)", "Noisy feedback"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070955863", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"55231762300": {"Name": "Sun Q.", "AuthorID": "55231762300", "AffiliationID": "121967850", "AffiliationName": "Nantong Research Institute for Advanced Communication Technologies (NRIACT)"}, "56493254100": {"Name": "Wang J.", "AuthorID": "56493254100", "AffiliationID": "121519926", "AffiliationName": "Research Center of Networks and Communications, Peng Cheng Laboratory"}, "57210584867": {"Name": "Wu Y.", "AuthorID": "57210584867", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57210589839": {"Name": "Xu C.", "AuthorID": "57210589839", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7404759940": {"Name": "Wong K.K.", "AuthorID": "7404759940", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
