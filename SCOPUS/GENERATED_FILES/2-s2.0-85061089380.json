Employing a Bayesian fitting approach permits the integration of prior information into the analysis to incorporate expected parameter distributions and to prevent over-fitting. However, the analysis can be time consuming if a general numerical solution of the BM equations is applied. In this study, we combined a Bayesian fitting algorithm with approximate analytical solutions of the BM equations to achieve feasible computational times. To evaluate the accuracy and speed of the suggested approach, phantoms including Iodipamide, Taurine and Creatine were tested in addition to simulated data with continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed saturation with Gaussian pulses. A significant reduction of computational time was achieved when fitting CW data (about 50-fold) and pulsed saturation data (more than 100-fold) with the analytical model while the estimated parameters were largely consistent with the parameters from the general numerical solution. The increased speed of the algorithm facilitates the Bayesian analysis of CEST data within clinically feasible processing times. Other analytical models valid for different parameter regimes may be employed to extend the applicability to a wider range of CEST agents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Amide proton transfer", "Chemical exchange saturation transfer", "Pulsed saturation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amide proton transfers", "Approximate analytical solutions", "Chemical exchange saturation transfer", "Estimated parameter", "Field inhomogeneity", "Magnetization transfer", "Metabolite concentrations", "Parameter distributions", "Algorithms", "Bayes Theorem", "Computer Simulation", "Feasibility Studies", "Magnetic Fields", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Normal Distribution", "Phantoms, Imaging", "Protons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85061089380", "SubjectAreas": [["Biophysics", "BIOC", "1304"], ["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Nuclear and High Energy Physics", "PHYS", "3106"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"57205684239": {"Name": "Kujawa A.", "AuthorID": "57205684239", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, University College London"}, "57212315640": {"Name": "Kim M.", "AuthorID": "57212315640", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, University College London"}, "57194760638": {"Name": "Demetriou E.", "AuthorID": "57194760638", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, University College London"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, University College London"}, "57190948349": {"Name": "Anemone A.", "AuthorID": "57190948349", "AffiliationID": "60012259", "AffiliationName": "Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino"}, "8564616500": {"Name": "Livio Longo D.", "AuthorID": "8564616500", "AffiliationID": "60021199", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging (IBB), National Research Council of Italy (CNR)"}, "38663806800": {"Name": "Zaiss M.", "AuthorID": "38663806800", "AffiliationID": "60004898", "AffiliationName": "Magnetic Resonance Center, Max-Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics"}}}
