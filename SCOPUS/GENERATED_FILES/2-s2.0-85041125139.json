This research, the first to utilise a major UK retailer\u2019s loyalty card dataset, presents a novel data-driven approach for quantifying uncertainty in consumer addresses. Uncertain cases were identified through the linkage of locational and behavioural attributes and consumer mobility patterns recorded at a small area level. Such methods are not only important for the reliable adoption of large commercially generated datasets in research, but also for retailers if utilising this information to inform location-based marketing strategies. Results are contextualized with dynamics in the general population, demonstrating comparable relationships with Census migration patterns.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Big data", "Mobility", "Retail", "Spatial analysis", "Uncertainty"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041125139", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"]], "AuthorData": {"56890483300": {"Name": "Lloyd A.", "AuthorID": "56890483300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}, "55111283100": {"Name": "Cheshire J.", "AuthorID": "55111283100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
