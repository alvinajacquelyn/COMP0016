However, the association between preference for solitude (PfS), SI, and SH is unknown. The prevalence of adolescents who have both of PfS and social isolation and the risks for SI and SH among them are also unknown. Methods Information on PfS, social isolation, SI, and SH was collected in a large-scale school-based survey on adolescents, using a self-report questionnaire. Associations between PfS, SI, and SH were examined by logistic regression analysis. The interactions between PfS and social isolation on SI and SH were also investigated. The odds of SI and SH were examined for groups defined by presence of PfS and social isolation. Results Responses from 17,437 students (89.3% of relevant classes) were available. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and social isolation, PfS was associated with increased odds of SI (odds ratio [OR] = 3.1) and SH (OR = 1.9). There was no interaction between PfS and social isolation on SI and SH. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, the odds for SI (OR = 8.6) and SH (OR = 3.8) were highest among adolescents with both PfS and social isolation (8.4% of all respondents). Conclusions PfS was associated with increased odds of SI and SH in adolescents. No interaction effect between PfS and social isolation on SI and SH was found, but adolescents with PfS and social isolation had the highest risk for SI and SH. Parents and professionals should pay attention to suicide risk in adolescents with PfS.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adolescence", "Preference for solitude", "Self-harm", "Social isolation", "Suicidal ideation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adolescent Behavior", "Age Factors", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Risk Factors", "Schools", "Self-Injurious Behavior", "Social Isolation", "Social Support", "Students", "Suicidal Ideation", "Surveys and Questionnaires"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018166739", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"57188725825": {"Name": "Endo K.", "AuthorID": "57188725825", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "53063099300": {"Name": "Ando S.", "AuthorID": "53063099300", "AffiliationID": "60178602", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo"}, "22036925600": {"Name": "Yamasaki S.", "AuthorID": "22036925600", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "35311924300": {"Name": "Nishida A.", "AuthorID": "35311924300", "AffiliationID": "60002783", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Science, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science"}, "6602579791": {"Name": "Shimodera S.", "AuthorID": "6602579791", "AffiliationID": "60013623, 60000088", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuropsychiatry, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University"}, "26538314600": {"Name": "Usami S.", "AuthorID": "26538314600", "AffiliationID": "60014256", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Tsukuba"}, "7202556942": {"Name": "Okazaki Y.", "AuthorID": "7202556942", "AffiliationID": "60022137", "AffiliationName": "Tokyo Metropolitan Matsuzawa Hospital"}, "55629396800": {"Name": "Sasaki T.", "AuthorID": "55629396800", "AffiliationID": "60025272", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physical and Health Education, Graduate School of Education, The University of Tokyo"}, "7402054647": {"Name": "Richards M.", "AuthorID": "7402054647", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging, University College London"}, "22957853600": {"Name": "Hatch S.", "AuthorID": "22957853600", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College"}}}
