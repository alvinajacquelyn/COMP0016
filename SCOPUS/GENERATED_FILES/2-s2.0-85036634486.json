In this study, we investigated the role of two constituents of viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis \u2013 Early Secreted Antigenic Target-6 (ESAT-6), and mycobacterial RNA\u2013 in inflammasome activation in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a key site of inflammation in intraocular TB. We found that ESAT-6 induced caspase-1 activation and inflammasome priming in mouse RPE cells, substantially more in wild-type than in Tlr2/3/4/7/9\u2212/\u2212, Myd88\u2212/\u2212 or Nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 RPE cells. Sub-retinal ESAT-6 injection resulted in greater RPE degeneration in wild-type than in Nlrp3\u2212/\u2212 mice. In human ocular TB tissue sections, NLRP3 staining was noted in retina as well as RPE. Mycobacterial RNA, specifically its double stranded component, also induced caspase-1 activation, and the double stranded RNA was immunolocalized to human ocular TB sections. Our observations suggest that inflammasome activation in RPE by viable M. tuberculosis could potentially contribute to human intraocular TB.", "AuthorKeywords": ["ESAT-6", "Inflammasome", "Intraocular tuberculosis", "NLRP3", "RNA"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Antigens, Bacterial", "Bacterial Proteins", "Caspase 1", "Host-Parasite Interactions", "Humans", "Inflammasomes", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein", "Retinal Pigment Epithelium", "RNA, Bacterial", "RNA, Double-Stranded", "Tuberculosis, Ocular"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85036634486", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology", "IMMU", "2404"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"36092614700": {"Name": "Basu S.", "AuthorID": "36092614700", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Kentucky"}, "15834521000": {"Name": "Fowler B.", "AuthorID": "15834521000", "AffiliationID": "60015941", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Kentucky"}, "35098731400": {"Name": "Kerur N.", "AuthorID": "35098731400", "AffiliationID": "60021918", "AffiliationName": "University of Virginia"}, "6505971527": {"Name": "Arnvig K.", "AuthorID": "6505971527", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College"}, "7401628686": {"Name": "Rao N.", "AuthorID": "7401628686", "AffiliationID": "60015183, 60029311", "AffiliationName": "USC Eye Institute, The Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California"}}}
