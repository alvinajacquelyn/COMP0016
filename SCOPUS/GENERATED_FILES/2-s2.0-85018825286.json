For this reason, times of high \u03b413C are conventionally interpreted to be oxygenation events caused by excess organic burial. Here we show that the carbon isotope mass balance is also significantly affected by tectonic uplift and erosion via changes to the inorganic carbon cycle that are independent of changes to the isotopic composition of carbon input. This view is supported by inverse covariance between \u03b413C and a range of uplift proxies, including seawater 87Sr/86Sr, which demonstrates how erosional forcing of carbonate weathering outweighs that of organic burial on geological timescales. Amodel of the long-term carbon cycle shows that increases in \u03b413C need not be associated with increased organic burial and that alternative tectonic drivers (erosion, outgassing) provide testable and plausible explanations for sustained deviations from the long-term \u03b413C mean. Our approach emphasizes the commonly overlooked difference between how net and gross carbon fluxes affect the long-term carbon isotope mass balance, and may lead to reassessment of the role that the \u03b413C record plays in reconstructing the oxygenation of earth's surface environment.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carbon isotopes", "Carbonate weathering", "Long-term carbon cycle", "Mass balance", "Tectonics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85018825286", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"14626549300": {"Name": "Shields G.", "AuthorID": "14626549300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "54412572000": {"Name": "Mills B.", "AuthorID": "54412572000", "AffiliationID": "60012070", "AffiliationName": "School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds"}}}
