The results showed similar means and standard deviations in the facets scoring higher in both languages, except for Adaptability (d: - 0.50) and emotion management (d: - 0.37). The alpha reliabilities of the TEIQue facets were similar and acceptable in both samples. The TEIQue alpha was 0.95 and 0.90 in Catalonia and the UK, respectively. All TEIQue facets were highly correlated in both samples, suggesting a coherent construct. The factor structure was investigated through exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for 13 and 15 facets respectively. The four-factor theoretical structure was satisfactorily replicated using orthogonal rotation for 13 and 15 facets. Factor congruency coefficients were at, or above, 0.98 for both languages and both solutions (13 and 15 facets). As expected, CFA analyses of the simple structures of the three models yielded unsatisfactory fit indices, although these improved considerably after incorporating secondary loadings and correlated error terms. The cross-cultural stability of the instrument was supported by multigroup analyses. The relationships between TEIQue factors and facets were the same in both countries. The TEIQue psychometric properties were similar and robust in both samples.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cross-cultural research", "Factor analysis", "TEIQue", "Trait emotional intelligence"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966702602", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychology (all)", "PSYC", "3200"]], "AuthorData": {"6701479527": {"Name": "Aluja A.", "AuthorID": "6701479527", "AffiliationID": "112766518", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Research"}, "7005906687": {"Name": "Blanch A.", "AuthorID": "7005906687", "AffiliationID": "112766518", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Biomedical Research"}, "6603597461": {"Name": "Petrides K.V.", "AuthorID": "6603597461", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "London Psychometric Laboratory, University College London"}}}
