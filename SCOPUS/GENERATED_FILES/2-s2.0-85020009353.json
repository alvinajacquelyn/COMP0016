ZNF683/HOBIT mRNA was preferentially expressed in NK cells compared to other human peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes. During ex vivo differentiation, ZNF683/HOBIT mRNA started to increase shortly after addition of IL-15 and further accumulated in parallel to the generation of CD56+ NK cells. shRNA-mediated knockdown of ZNF683/HOBIT resulted in a substantial reduction of CD56-CD14-NK-cell progenitors and the following generation of CD56+ NK cells was largely abrogated. The few CD56+ NK cells, which escaped the developmental inhibition in the ZNF683/HOBIT knockdown cultures, displayed normal levels of NKG2A and KIR receptors. Functional analyses of these cells showed no differences in degranulation capacity from control cultures. However, the proportion of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells appeared to be increased upon ZNF683/HOBIT knockdown. These results indicate a key role of ZNF683/HOBIT for the differentiation of the human NK-cell lineage and further suggest a potential negative control on IFN-\u03b3 production in more mature human NK cells.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CD56", "Ex vivo differentiation", "Natural killer cells", "NK-cell development", "ZNF683/HOBIT"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020009353", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"57190426072": {"Name": "Post M.", "AuthorID": "57190426072", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55658557700": {"Name": "Cuapio A.", "AuthorID": "55658557700", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55428746900": {"Name": "Osl M.", "AuthorID": "55428746900", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55427750800": {"Name": "Lehmann D.", "AuthorID": "55427750800", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6603792319": {"Name": "Resch U.", "AuthorID": "6603792319", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7103269403": {"Name": "Hofer E.", "AuthorID": "7103269403", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Vascular Biology and Thrombosis Research, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "24334561300": {"Name": "Davies D.M.", "AuthorID": "24334561300", "AffiliationID": "60009797, 60177635", "AffiliationName": "Division of Cancer Studies, Research Oncology Section, Guy's Hospital Campus, King's College London School of Medicine"}, "6603785385": {"Name": "Nathwani A.", "AuthorID": "6603785385", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Oncology, University College London Cancer Institute"}, "55127695100": {"Name": "Bilban M.", "AuthorID": "55127695100", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6603418853": {"Name": "Schlechta B.", "AuthorID": "6603418853", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "55893248100": {"Name": "Eppel W.", "AuthorID": "55893248100", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "6602666934": {"Name": "Stoiber D.", "AuthorID": "6602666934", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Pharmacology, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna"}, "7004171759": {"Name": "Casanova E.", "AuthorID": "7004171759", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physiology, Center of Physiology and Pharmacology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna"}, "12647472600": {"Name": "Spanholtz J.", "AuthorID": "12647472600", "AffiliationID": "115125588", "AffiliationName": "Glycostem Therapeutics"}}}
