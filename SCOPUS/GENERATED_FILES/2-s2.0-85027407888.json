Changes in mitochondrial morphology are regulated by the mitochondrial fusion proteins \u2013 mitofusins 1 and 2 (Mfn1 and 2), and optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) as well as the mitochondrial fission proteins \u2013 dynamin-related peptide 1 (Drp1) and fission protein 1 (Fis1). Despite having a unique spatial arrangement, cardiac mitochondria have been implicated in a variety of disorders including ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury (IRI), heart failure, diabetes, and pulmonary hypertension. In this chapter, we review the influence of mitochondrial dynamics in these cardiac disorders as well as their potential as therapeutic targets in tackling cardiovascular disease.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiac diseases", "Cardiac disorders", "Drp1", "Mfn1", "Mfn2", "Mitochondrial dynamics", "Mitochondrial morphology", "Opa1"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Diabetes Mellitus", "Heart Diseases", "Heart Failure", "Humans", "Hypertension, Pulmonary", "Mitochondria, Heart", "Mitochondrial Dynamics", "Myocardial Reperfusion Injury"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85027407888", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry", "BIOC", "1303"], ["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics (all)", "PHAR", "3000"]], "AuthorData": {"26640545400": {"Name": "Ong S.", "AuthorID": "26640545400", "AffiliationID": "60004409", "AffiliationName": "National Heart Research Institute Singapore, National Heart Centre Singapore"}, "6602976997": {"Name": "Hausenloy D.", "AuthorID": "6602976997", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "The Hatter Cardiovascular Institute, University College London Hospitals and Medical School"}}}
