Thermoresponsive poly (urea-urethane) nanohybrid elastomer (PUU-POSS) scaffolds were implanted in rats for up to 3 months. The porous structure and tensile mechanical properties of the scaffolds are listed and compared before and after in vitro and in vivo tests. The details of the histological analysis of the explants with different initial stiffness and porous structures at various time points are presented. The images and data presented support the conclusion about the coupled effects of stiffness softening and the hierarchical porous structure modulating tissue ingrowth, vascularization and macrophage polarization in the article (Wu et al., 2018).", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060223358", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"57204005303": {"Name": "Wu L.", "AuthorID": "57204005303", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57193180976": {"Name": "Magaz A.", "AuthorID": "57193180976", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57205298686": {"Name": "Oliver N.", "AuthorID": "57205298686", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "35733502300": {"Name": "Darbyshire A.", "AuthorID": "35733502300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "57204294898": {"Name": "Loizidou M.", "AuthorID": "57204294898", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7004667094": {"Name": "Emberton M.", "AuthorID": "7004667094", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "7401655806": {"Name": "Song W.", "AuthorID": "7401655806", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Biomaterials in Surgical Reconstruction and Regeneration, Division of Surgery & Interventional Science, University College London"}, "24574421800": {"Name": "Maughan E.", "AuthorID": "24574421800", "AffiliationID": "60029890, 60022148, 60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital and University College London"}, "7004957785": {"Name": "Birchall M.", "AuthorID": "7004957785", "AffiliationID": "60029890, 60022148, 60011326", "AffiliationName": "UCL Ear Institute, Royal National Throat Nose and Ear Hospital and University College London"}}}
