We propose a new approach towards aiding the graphic designer to consider the major factors relevant to player engagement. This article describes a method for creating effective graphical content for serious games that takes into account the impact of complex pictograms on player engagement and on the learning process. We show how we applied our method to the design of a serious game for mobile phones aimed at Nepalese women in rural areas with low literacy skills. Initial results from case study suggest that our method helps designers to improve the design and the logic behind their use of imagery to the extent where the need to use text in the game\u2019s user interface was removed.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abstraction", "E-learning", "Engagement", "Graphic design", "Method", "Pictogram", "Serious game", "Visual complexity"], "IndexKeywords": ["Abstraction", "Engagement", "Graphic design", "Method", "Pictogram", "Visual complexity"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85047221361", "SubjectAreas": [["Software", "COMP", "1712"], ["Human-Computer Interaction", "COMP", "1709"], ["Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition", "COMP", "1707"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"]], "AuthorData": {"35181998500": {"Name": "Soriano D.", "AuthorID": "35181998500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction"}, "57202114785": {"Name": "Mueller S.", "AuthorID": "57202114785", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction"}, "53263569800": {"Name": "Fordham M.", "AuthorID": "53263569800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction"}, "57202114021": {"Name": "Boscor A.", "AuthorID": "57202114021", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction"}, "6506790018": {"Name": "Kostkova P.", "AuthorID": "6506790018", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction"}, "57207990844": {"Name": "Arjyal A.", "AuthorID": "57207990844", "AffiliationID": "100637176", "AffiliationName": "Health Research and Social Development"}, "6602118888": {"Name": "Baral S.", "AuthorID": "6602118888", "AffiliationID": "100637176", "AffiliationName": "Health Research and Social Development"}, "7005235356": {"Name": "Hearn G.J.", "AuthorID": "7005235356", "AffiliationID": "120714736", "AffiliationName": "Hearn Geoserve Ltd."}, "23110731700": {"Name": "Le Masson V.", "AuthorID": "23110731700", "AffiliationID": "60002552", "AffiliationName": "Overseas Development Institute"}, "23486721300": {"Name": "Saville N.M.", "AuthorID": "23486721300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute for Global Health"}}}
