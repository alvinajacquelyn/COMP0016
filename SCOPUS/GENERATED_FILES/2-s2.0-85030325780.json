The parameters of the sinusoidal components are estimated online, and the update laws are individually controlled by an excitation-based switching logic enabling the update of a parameter only when the measured signal is sufficiently informative. This way doing, the algorithm is able to tackle the problem of overparameterization (i.e., when the internal model accounts for a number of sinusoids that is larger than the true spectral content) or temporarily fading sinusoidal components. The stability analysis proves the existence of a tuning parameter set, for which the estimator's dynamics are input-to-state stable with respect to bounded measurement disturbances. The performance of the proposed estimation approach is evaluated and compared with the other existing tools by extensive simulation trials and real-time experiments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adaptive observers", "estimation of multi-sinusoidal signals", "robust estimation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Estimation approaches", "Extensive simulations", "Input to state stable", "Measurement disturbances", "Multi-sinusoidal signals", "Observers", "Sinusoidal components", "Stability analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85030325780", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56021899900": {"Name": "Chen B.", "AuthorID": "56021899900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "7202831744": {"Name": "Hui S.", "AuthorID": "7202831744", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}, "55161538500": {"Name": "Parisini T.", "AuthorID": "55161538500", "AffiliationID": "60018363", "AffiliationName": "Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste"}, "23991087000": {"Name": "Pin G.", "AuthorID": "23991087000", "AffiliationID": "60019612", "AffiliationName": "Electrolux Italia S.p.A"}, "55520997000": {"Name": "Ng W.", "AuthorID": "55520997000", "AffiliationID": "60006541", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong"}}}
