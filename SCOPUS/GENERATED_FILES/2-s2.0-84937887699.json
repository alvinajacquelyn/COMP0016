As clinicians, we are unsure how to interpret the results of this novel test. There is controversy in the literature as to the significance of the detection of CMV in the gut. Whilst the importance of CMV and reactivation of the virus is clear in those patients such as allograft recipients with established immune compromise, the role is less clear in patients with less damaged immune systems. We explore whether the detection of CMV in such cases influences outcome and how it should be optimally managed. We discuss the optimal management of such cases, according to current guidelines, with a review of the literature.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Colitis", "Cytomegalovirus", "Cytomegalovirus Infections", "Humans", "Intestinal Mucosa"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84937887699", "SubjectAreas": [["Microbiology (medical)", "MEDI", "2726"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"19640046200": {"Name": "Goodman A.L.", "AuthorID": "19640046200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "57203312734": {"Name": "Griffiths P.D.", "AuthorID": "57203312734", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Virology, University College London Medical School"}, "7201998521": {"Name": "Webster D.P.", "AuthorID": "7201998521", "AffiliationID": "60029950", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Virology, University College London Medical School"}, "57202223898": {"Name": "Murray C.D.", "AuthorID": "57202223898", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Gastroenterology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}, "57220708575": {"Name": "Watkins J.", "AuthorID": "57220708575", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cellular Pathology, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
