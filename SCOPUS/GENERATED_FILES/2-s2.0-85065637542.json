Platelet membrane (PLTM) biomimetic DDSs are expected to enhance retention in vivo and escape uptake by macrophages, as well as minimizing immunogenicity, attributing to the CD47 protein in PLTM sends \"don't eat me\" signals to macrophages. In addition, P-selectin is overexpressed on the PLTM, which would allow a PLTM-biomimetic DDS to specifically bind to the CD44 receptors upregulated on the surface of cancer cells. Results: In this study, porous nanoparticles loaded with the anti-cancer drug bufalin (Bu) were prepared from a chitosan oligosaccharide (CS)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) copolymer. These were subsequently coated with platelet membrane (PLTM) to form PLTM-CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs. The PLTM-CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs bear a particle size of ~ 192 nm, and present the same surface proteins as the PLTM. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry results revealed a greater uptake of PLTM-CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs than uncoated CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs, as a result of the targeted binding of P-selectin on the surface of the PLTM to the CD44 receptors of H22 hepatoma cells. In vivo biodistribution studies in H22-tumor carrying mice revealed that the PLTM-CS-pPLGA NPs accumulated in the tumor, because of a combination of active targeting effect and the EPR effect. The PLTM-CS-pPLGA/Bu NPs led to more effective tumor growth inhibition over other bufalin formulations. Conclusions: Platelet membrane biomimetic nanoparticles played a promising targeted treatment of cancer with low side effect.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomimetic", "Bufalin", "Nanoparticles", "Platelet membrane", "Targeted anti-tumor drug delivery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antitumor drug deliveries", "Antitumor drugs", "Biomimetic nanoparticles", "Bufalin", "Chitosan oligosaccharide", "Drug delivery system", "Platelet membranes", "Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)", "Animals", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Biological Transport", "Biomimetic Materials", "Blood Platelets", "Bufanolides", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Cell Survival", "Chitosan", "Delayed-Action Preparations", "Drug Carriers", "Drug Compounding", "Drug Liberation", "Female", "Humans", "Hyaluronan Receptors", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred ICR", "Nanoparticles", "Oligosaccharides", "Particle Size", "Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer", "Tissue Distribution"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065637542", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57194201473": {"Name": "Wang H.", "AuthorID": "57194201473", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57193713166": {"Name": "Niu S.", "AuthorID": "57193713166", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57194273124": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57194273124", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57205664208": {"Name": "Xie X.", "AuthorID": "57205664208", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "55710395600": {"Name": "Zhu L.M.", "AuthorID": "55710395600", "AffiliationID": "60010953", "AffiliationName": "College of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Donghua University"}, "57116662400": {"Name": "Wu J.", "AuthorID": "57116662400", "AffiliationID": "60108796", "AffiliationName": "College of Basic Medicine, Yunnan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine"}, "7406083266": {"Name": "Williams G.R.", "AuthorID": "7406083266", "AffiliationID": "60016379, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London"}, "57201391728": {"Name": "Fan Q.", "AuthorID": "57201391728", "AffiliationID": "60073570, 60161479", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pharmacy, Shandong Cancer Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Shandong Academy of Medical Science"}}}
