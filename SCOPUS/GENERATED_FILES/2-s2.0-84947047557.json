A national observational cohort study from england, wales, and northern ireland", "Year": 2015, "Source": "Lancet HIV", "Volume": "2", "Issue": 6, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 24, "DOI": "10.1016/S2352-3018(15)00063-6", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84947047557&origin=inward", "Abstract": "Background Whether the incidence of tuberculosis in HIV-positive people receiving long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains above background population rates is unclear. We compared tuberculosis incidence in people receiving ART with background rates in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Methods We analysed a national cohort of HIV-positive individuals linked to the national tuberculosis register. Tuberculosis incidence in the HIV-positive cohort (2007-11) was stratifi ed by ethnic origin and time on ART and compared with background rates (2009). Ethnic groups were defi ned as follows: the black African group included all individuals of black African origin, including those born in the UK and overseas; the white ethnic group included all white individuals born in the UK and overseas; the south Asian group included those of Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi origin, born in the UK and overseas; and the other ethnic group included all other ethnic origins, including black Afro-Caribbeans. Findings The HIV-positive cohort comprised 79 919 individuals, in whom there were 1550 incident cases in 231 664 person-years of observation (incidence 6\u00b77 cases per 1000 person-years). Incidence of tuberculosis in the HIVpositive cohort was 13\u00b76 per 1000 person-years in black Africans and 1\u00b77 per 1000 person-years in white individuals. Incidence of tuberculosis during long-term ART (\u22655 years) in black Africans with HIV was 2\u00b74 per 1000 personyears, similar to background rates of 1\u00b79 per 1000 person-years in this group (rate ratio 1\u00b72, 95% CI 0\u00b796-1\u00b76; p=0\u00b7083); but in white individuals with HIV on long-term ART the incidence of 0\u00b75 per 1000 person-years was higher than the background rate of 0\u00b704 per 1000 person-years (rate ratio 14\u00b75, 9\u00b74-21\u00b73; p<0\u00b70001). The increased incidence relative to background in white HIV-positive individuals persisted when analysis was restricted to person-time accrued on ART with CD4 counts of at least 500 cells per \u03bcL and when white HIV-positive individuals born abroad were excluded. Interpretation Tuberculosis incidence is unacceptably high irrespective of HIV status in black Africans. In white individuals with HIV, tuberculosis incidence is signifi cantly higher than background rates in white people despite long-term ART. Expanded testing and treatment for latent tuberculosis infection to all HIV-infected adults, irrespective of ART status and CD4 cell count, might be warranted.
