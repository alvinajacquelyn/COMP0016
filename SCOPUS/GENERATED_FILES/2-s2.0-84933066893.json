We examined endogenous neurogenesis and glia changes across the range of pathologic severity of AD in people with and without dementia to address this key question. METHODS: Endogenous neurogenesis and glia in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus neurogenic niches were evaluated using single and double immunohistochemistry and a validated antibody selection for stage-specific and type-specific markers in autopsy tissue from a representative cohort of 28 participants in the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study. Immunopositive cells were measured blinded to diagnosis using bright-field and fluorescent microscopy. RESULTS: The number of newly generated neurons significantly declined only in the dentate gyrus of patients with severe tau pathology. No other changes in other neurogenic markers were observed in either of the neurogenic niches. Alterations in astrocytes and microglia were also observed in the dentate gyrus across the different stages of tau pathology. No change in any of the markers was observed in individuals who died with dementia compared with individuals who did not die with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in endogenous neurogenesis appeared to be confined to a reduction in the generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of patients with AD and severe neurofibrillary tangle pathology and were accompanied by changes in the glia load. These data suggest that intervention enhancing endogenous neurogenesis may be a potential therapeutic target in AD.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Glia", "Human brain", "Neural progenitors", "Neurogenesis", "Tangles"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Alzheimer Disease", "Animals", "Cell Count", "Dentate Gyrus", "Humans", "Lateral Ventricles", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Neuroglia", "Neurons", "Stem Cells"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84933066893", "SubjectAreas": [["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"6602785730": {"Name": "Ekonomou A.", "AuthorID": "6602785730", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London"}, "7202154416": {"Name": "Francis P.T.", "AuthorID": "7202154416", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London"}, "55201515800": {"Name": "Somani A.", "AuthorID": "55201515800", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London"}, "6602640297": {"Name": "Minger S.L.", "AuthorID": "6602640297", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London"}, "35351371500": {"Name": "Ballard C.G.", "AuthorID": "35351371500", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, King's College London"}, "24399717300": {"Name": "Savva G.M.", "AuthorID": "24399717300", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "57210386759": {"Name": "Brayne C.", "AuthorID": "57210386759", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge"}, "7102583232": {"Name": "Forster G.", "AuthorID": "7102583232", "AffiliationID": "60008750, 60001881", "AffiliationName": "Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, University of Sheffield"}, "57213466134": {"Name": "Johnson M.", "AuthorID": "57213466134", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University"}, "7202233944": {"Name": "Perry E.K.", "AuthorID": "7202233944", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University"}, "56010678100": {"Name": "Attems J.", "AuthorID": "56010678100", "AffiliationID": "60026712, 60006222", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Ageing and Health, Newcastle University"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
