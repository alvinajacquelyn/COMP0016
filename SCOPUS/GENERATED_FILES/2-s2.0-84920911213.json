However, the way in which tremor is represented in the output of the spinal cord circuitries is largely unknown because of the difficulties in identifying the behavior of individual motor units from tremulous muscles. By using novel methods for the decomposition of multichannel surface EMG, we provide a systematic analysis of the discharge properties of motor units in nine ET patients, with concurrent recordings of EEG activity. This analysis allowed us to infer the contribution of common synaptic inputs to motor neurons in ET. Motor unit short-term synchronization was significantly greater in ET patients than in healthy subjects. Furthermore, the strong association between the degree of synchronization and the peak in coherence between motor unit spike trains at the tremor frequency indicated that the high synchronization levels were generated mainly by common synaptic inputs specifically at the tremor frequency. The coherence between EEG and motor unit spike trains demonstrated the presence of common cortical input to the motor neurons at the tremor frequency. Nonetheless, the strength of this input was uncorrelated to the net common synaptic input at the tremor frequency, suggesting a contribution of spinal afferents or secondary supraspinal pathways in projecting common input at the tremor frequency. These results provide the first systematic analysis of the neural drive to the muscle in ET and elucidate some of its characteristics that determine pathological tremulous muscle activity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Coherence", "EEG", "EMG", "Motor neuron", "Motor unit", "Pathological tremor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Electroencephalography", "Electromyography", "Essential Tremor", "Hand", "Humans", "Middle Aged", "Motor Neurons", "Muscle, Skeletal", "Sensorimotor Cortex", "Synapses"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84920911213", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"]], "AuthorData": {"36136833700": {"Name": "Gallego J.A.", "AuthorID": "36136833700", "AffiliationID": "60006754, 60103740", "AffiliationName": "Neuroengineering and Cognitive Science Group, Centre for Automation and Robotics, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"}, "57194829160": {"Name": "Rocon E.", "AuthorID": "57194829160", "AffiliationID": "60028426", "AffiliationName": "Postgraduate Program, Universidade Federal do Esp\u00edrito Santo"}, "36098955500": {"Name": "Dideriksen J.L.", "AuthorID": "36098955500", "AffiliationID": "60021110, 60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurorehabilitation Engineering, Bernstein Focus Neurotechnology G\u00f6ttingen, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, Georg-August University"}, "7004908025": {"Name": "Farina D.", "AuthorID": "7004908025", "AffiliationID": "60021110, 60031514", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurorehabilitation Engineering, Bernstein Focus Neurotechnology G\u00f6ttingen, Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience, University Medical Center G\u00f6ttingen, Georg-August University"}, "6603265157": {"Name": "Holobar A.", "AuthorID": "6603265157", "AffiliationID": "60004060", "AffiliationName": "University of Maribor"}, "57212057392": {"Name": "Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez J.", "AuthorID": "57212057392", "AffiliationID": "60022146, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Neural Rehabilitation Group, Cajal Institute, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"}, "7202123192": {"Name": "Pons J.L.", "AuthorID": "7202123192", "AffiliationID": "60022146, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Neural Rehabilitation Group, Cajal Institute, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas"}, "7202755371": {"Name": "Louis E.D.", "AuthorID": "7202755371", "AffiliationID": "60027565, 60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University"}}}
