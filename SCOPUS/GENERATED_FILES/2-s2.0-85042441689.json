We examined whether having the experience of temporary employment was associated with tooth loss among working adults in Japan. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study from the 2010-2011 Japanese Study on Stratification, Health, Income, and Neighborhood study that analyzed 2652 participants aged 25-50years (men=1394; women=1258). Independent variable was changes in employment status (continuous regular employment and the experience of temporary employment). Dependent variable was self-reported tooth loss (none, 1 tooth, 2 teeth, 3 teeth, 4 teeth, and more than 4 teeth). Covariates were sex, age, years of education, self-rated household economic status in early life at 5years old, marital status, number of family members in the household, history of diabetes, and body mass index. We conducted anegative binomial regression analysis to estimate prevalence rate ratios (PRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for tooth loss. We also confirmed the interaction term between changes in employment status and sex. Results: The median age of the participants was 37years. The percentages of men and women who experienced temporary employment were 14.5% and 61.3%, respectively. Compared with continuous regular employment, the experience of temporary employment was significantly associated with tooth loss in both sexes after adjusting for the covariates (men: PRR=1.50 [95%CI=1.13, 2.00]; women: PRR=1.42 [95%CI=1.14, 1.76]). The interaction term between employment status and sex was not significant (p=0.71). Conclusions: Temporary employment is adversely associated with oral health.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Employment status", "Non-regular employment", "Number of teeth"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Educational Status", "Employment", "Female", "Humans", "Income", "Male", "Marital Status", "Middle Aged", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Tooth Loss", "Unemployment"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85042441689", "SubjectAreas": [["Dentistry (all)", "DENT", "3500"]], "AuthorData": {"57211696659": {"Name": "Sato Y.", "AuthorID": "57211696659", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Department of International and Community Oral Health"}, "54997575400": {"Name": "Tsuboya T.", "AuthorID": "54997575400", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Department of International and Community Oral Health"}, "22984268200": {"Name": "Aida J.", "AuthorID": "22984268200", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Department of International and Community Oral Health"}, "36852116300": {"Name": "Osaka K.", "AuthorID": "36852116300", "AffiliationID": "60008435", "AffiliationName": "Tohoku University Graduate School of Dentistry, Department of International and Community Oral Health"}, "7102907522": {"Name": "Watt R.", "AuthorID": "7102907522", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London, Department of Epidemiology and Public Health"}}}
