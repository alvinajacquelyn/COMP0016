The formation and morphology of the NBs are confirmed by UV-visible spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopy respectively. A remarkable improvement in electroactive \u03b2 phase nucleation (\u223c82%) and the dielectric constant (\u03b5 \u223c 3.1 \u00d7 106 at 20 Hz) has been observed in the nanocomposites (NCs). The interface between the NBs and the polymer matrix plays a crucial role in the enhancement of the electroactive \u03b2 phase and the dielectric properties of thin films. Strong interaction via hydrogen bonds between Ni(OH)2 NBs and the PVDF matrix is the main reason for enhancement in \u03b2 phase crystallization and improved dielectric properties. The NC thin films can be utilized for potential applications as high energy storage devices like supercapacitors, solid electrolyte batteries, self-charging power cells, piezoelectric nanogenerators, and thin film transistors and sensors.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Crystallization", "Electric Impedance", "Hydroxides", "Nanocomposites", "Nickel", "Polyvinyls"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84929179332", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"57219524421": {"Name": "Thakur P.", "AuthorID": "57219524421", "AffiliationID": "100350557", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Netaji Nagar College for Women"}, "56248104400": {"Name": "Kool A.", "AuthorID": "56248104400", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "16456874100": {"Name": "Bagchi B.", "AuthorID": "16456874100", "AffiliationID": "60023083", "AffiliationName": "Fuel Cell and Battery Division, Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute"}, "56578161300": {"Name": "Hoque N.A.", "AuthorID": "56578161300", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}, "55476996600": {"Name": "Das S.", "AuthorID": "55476996600", "AffiliationID": "60000912", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, IIEST"}, "35547678500": {"Name": "Nandy P.", "AuthorID": "35547678500", "AffiliationID": "60020825", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Jadavpur University"}}}
