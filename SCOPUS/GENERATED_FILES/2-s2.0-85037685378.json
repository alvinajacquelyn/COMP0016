Methods Comparisons were made for the 530 participants of the Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study with T2DM (25\u201370 years) living in Amsterdam, Berlin, London, urban Ghana and rural Ghana. We used logistic regression to assess disparities with adjustment for age, sex and education. Results T2DM awareness was 51% in rural Ghana. This was lower than levels in Europe ranging from 73% in London (age-sex adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.7; 95%CI = 1.2\u20136.0) to 79% in Amsterdam (OR = 4.7; 95%CI = 2.3\u20139.6). T2DM treatment was also lower in rural Ghana (37%) than in urban Ghana (56%; OR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.3\u20135.3) and European sites ranging from 67% in London (OR = 3.4; 95%CI = 1.5\u20137.5) to 73% in Berlin (OR = 6.9; 95%CI = 2.9\u201316.4). In contrast, T2DM control in rural Ghana (63%) was comparable to Amsterdam and Berlin, but higher than in London (40%; OR = 0.4; 95%CI = 0.2\u20130.9) and urban Ghana (28%; OR = 0.3; 95%CI = 0.1\u20130.6). Conclusions Our findings suggest that improved detection and treatment of T2DM in rural Ghana, and improved control for people with diagnosed T2DM in London and urban Ghana warrant prioritization. Further work is needed to understand the factors driving the differences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Ethnic minority groups", "Ghana", "Migrants", "RODAM study", "Sub-Saharan Africans", "Type 2 diabetes mellitus"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Europe", "Female", "Ghana", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Rural Population", "Transients and Migrants", "Urban Population"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85037685378", "SubjectAreas": [["Internal Medicine", "MEDI", "2724"], ["Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism", "MEDI", "2712"], ["Endocrinology", "BIOC", "1310"]], "AuthorData": {"57194339796": {"Name": "Bijlholt M.", "AuthorID": "57194339796", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Academic Medical Center - University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "56096843200": {"Name": "Meeks K.", "AuthorID": "56096843200", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Academic Medical Center - University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "15070089000": {"Name": "Beune E.", "AuthorID": "15070089000", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Academic Medical Center - University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "7003354375": {"Name": "Stronks K.", "AuthorID": "7003354375", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Academic Medical Center - University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "55940388300": {"Name": "Agyemang C.", "AuthorID": "55940388300", "AffiliationID": "60001157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, Academic Medical Center - University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Public Health Research Institute"}, "23011201600": {"Name": "Addo J.", "AuthorID": "23011201600", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7003651182": {"Name": "Smeeth L.", "AuthorID": "7003651182", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "Department of Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}, "7103093978": {"Name": "Schulze M.", "AuthorID": "7103093978", "AffiliationID": "60072296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Epidemiology, German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke"}, "22956801000": {"Name": "Danquah I.", "AuthorID": "22956801000", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Social Medicine, Epidemiology and Health Economics, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 University Medicine Berlin"}, "57194182765": {"Name": "Galbete C.", "AuthorID": "57194182765", "AffiliationID": "60072296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Epidemiology, German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke"}, "15118884800": {"Name": "de-Graft Aikins A.", "AuthorID": "15118884800", "AffiliationID": "60017910", "AffiliationName": "Regional Institute for Population Studies, University of Ghana"}, "7003935853": {"Name": "Klipstein-Grobusch K.", "AuthorID": "7003935853", "AffiliationID": "60016218", "AffiliationName": "Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand"}, "23985449200": {"Name": "Owusu-Dabo E.", "AuthorID": "23985449200", "AffiliationID": "60120536, 60071885", "AffiliationName": "Kumasi Centre for Collaborative Research, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)"}, "55101740600": {"Name": "Spranger J.", "AuthorID": "55101740600", "AffiliationID": "60026245, 60106629", "AffiliationName": "Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR), Charit\u00e9\u2013University Medicine Berlin"}, "7003334445": {"Name": "Mockenhaupt F.", "AuthorID": "7003334445", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tropical Medicine and International Health, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 University Medicine Berlin"}, "56655112500": {"Name": "Amoah S.", "AuthorID": "56655112500", "AffiliationID": "60026245", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Tropical Medicine and International Health, Charit\u00e9 \u2013 University Medicine Berlin"}, "56719634400": {"Name": "Bahendeka S.", "AuthorID": "56719634400", "AffiliationID": "60116805", "AffiliationName": "MKPGMS-Uganda Martyrs University"}}}
