Recently two meta-analyses have claimed that working memory training can be effective in enhancing cognitive skills in adulthood (Au et al. Behavioural Brain Research 228:(1) 107-115, 2014) and stemming cognitive decline in old age (Karbach & Verhaeghen Psychological Science 25:2027\u20132037, 2014). The current article critically evaluates these claims. We argue that these meta-analyses produce misleading results because of (1) biases in the studies included, (2) a failure to take account of baseline differences when calculating effect sizes, and (3) a failure to emphasize the difference between studies with treated versus untreated control groups. We present new meta-analyses and conclude that there is no convincing evidence that working memory training produces general cognitive benefits.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cognitive training", "Working memory"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aging", "Aptitude", "Executive Function", "Female", "Geriatric Assessment", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Learning", "Male", "Memory, Short-Term", "Practice (Psychology)"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957437137", "SubjectAreas": [["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Developmental and Educational Psychology", "PSYC", "3204"], ["Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous)", "ARTS", "1201"]], "AuthorData": {"36650912300": {"Name": "Melby-Lerv\u00e5g M.", "AuthorID": "36650912300", "AffiliationID": "60010348", "AffiliationName": "University of Oslo"}, "7006105965": {"Name": "Hulme C.", "AuthorID": "7006105965", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
