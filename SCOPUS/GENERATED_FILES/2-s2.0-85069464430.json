The role of healthcare professionals (HCPs) has been highlighted, with a lack of enthusiasm, inadequate information provision and poor promotion of available programmes all cited as affecting patients' decisions to attend. However, little is known about HCPs' views towards DSME. This study investigates the views of HCPs towards self-management generally and self-management in the context of DSME more specifically. Design A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to investigate HCPs views of type 2 diabetes self-management and DSME. Data were analysed thematically and emergent themes were mapped on to the constructs of Normalisation Process Theory (NPT). Setting Two boroughs in London, UK. Participants Sampling was purposive to recruit a diverse range of professional roles including GPs, practice nurses, diabetes specialist nurses, healthcare assistants (HCAs), receptionists and commissioners of care. Results Interviews were conducted with 22 participants. The NPT analysis demonstrated that while a self-management approach to diabetes care was viewed by HCPs as necessary and, in principle, valuable, the reality is much more complex. HCPs expressed ambivalence about pushing certain patients into self-managing, preferring to retain responsibility. There was a lack of awareness among HCPs about the content of DSME and benefits to patients. Commitment to and engagement with DSME was tempered by concerns about suitability for some patients. There was little evidence of communication between providers of group-based DSME and HCPs or of HCPs engaging in work to follow-up non-attenders. Conclusions HCPs have concerns about the appropriateness of DSME for all patients and discussed challenges to engaging with and performing the tasks required to embed the approach within practice. DSME, as a means of supporting self-management, was considered important in theory, but there was little evidence of HCPs seeing their role as extending beyond providing referrals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["general diabetes", "health care professionals", "patient education", "qualitative research"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Attitude of Health Personnel", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Interviews as Topic", "London", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Patient Education as Topic", "Professional Role", "Qualitative Research", "Self-Management", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85069464430", "SubjectAreas": [["Medicine (all)", "MEDI", "2700"]], "AuthorData": {"57206477392": {"Name": "Ross J.", "AuthorID": "57206477392", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7102932453": {"Name": "Stevenson F.A.", "AuthorID": "7102932453", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "55791267800": {"Name": "Pal K.", "AuthorID": "55791267800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "7202670002": {"Name": "Murray E.", "AuthorID": "7202670002", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Primary Care and Population Health, University College London"}, "24467238500": {"Name": "Dack C.", "AuthorID": "24467238500", "AffiliationID": "60030480", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychology, University of Bath"}, "7201679264": {"Name": "May C.R.", "AuthorID": "7201679264", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Epidemiology and Population Health"}, "7004779970": {"Name": "Michie S.", "AuthorID": "7004779970", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness, University College London"}, "7005996141": {"Name": "Yardley L.", "AuthorID": "7005996141", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Nuffield Department of Primary Health Care Sciences, University of Oxford"}}}
