Still however, a great deal remains to be understood about the interaction of environmentally and industrially relevant molecules such as water with these materials. Taking inspiration from advances in hybridising graphene and h-BN, we explore using density functional theory, the dissociation of water, hydrogen, methane, and methanol on graphene, h-BN, and their isoelectronic doped counterparts: BN doped graphene and C doped h-BN. We find that doped surfaces are considerably more reactive than their pristine counterparts and by comparing the reactivity of several small molecules, we develop a general framework for dissociative adsorption. From this a particularly attractive consequence of isoelectronic doping emerges: substrates can be doped to enhance their reactivity specifically towards either polar or non-polar adsorbates. As such, these substrates are potentially viable candidates for selective catalysts and membranes, with the implication that a range of tuneable materials can be designed.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["C-doped", "Dissociative adsorption", "Hexagonal boron nitride", "Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)", "Non-polar", "Selective catalysts", "Small molecules"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966377321", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Physical and Theoretical Chemistry", "CHEM", "1606"]], "AuthorData": {"56397085200": {"Name": "Al-Hamdani Y.S.", "AuthorID": "56397085200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7004035504": {"Name": "Alf\u00e8 D.", "AuthorID": "7004035504", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth Sciences, University College London"}, "56210204700": {"Name": "Michaelides A.", "AuthorID": "56210204700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "8685459200": {"Name": "Von Lilienfeld O.A.", "AuthorID": "8685459200", "AffiliationID": "60023588", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Physical Chemistry, National Center for Computational Design and Discovery of Novel Materials (MARVEL), Department of Chemistry, University of Basel"}}}
