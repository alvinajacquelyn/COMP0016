For a long time, the KD was not recommended for use in infancy (under the age of 2 years) because this is such a crucial period in development and the perceived high risk of nutritional inadequacies. Indeed, infants are a vulnerable population with specific nutritional requirements. But current research shows that the KD is highly effective and well tolerated in infants with epilepsy. Seizure freedom is often achieved and maintained in this specific patient group. There is a need for standardised protocols and management recommendations for clinical use. Method In April 2015, a project group of 5 experts was established in order to create a consensus statement regarding the clinical management of the KD in infants. The manuscript was reviewed and amended by a larger group of 10 international experts in the KD field. Consensus was reached with regard to guidance on how the diet should be administered and in whom. Results The resulting recommendations include patient selection, pre-KD counseling and evaluation, specific nutritional requirements, preferred initiation, monitoring of adverse effects at initiation and follow-up, evaluation and KD discontinuation. Conclusion This paper highlights recommendations based on best evidence, combined with expert opinions and gives directions for future research.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Guidelines", "Infant", "Ketogenic diet", "Refractory epilepsy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Disease Management", "Epilepsy", "Humans", "Infant", "Ketogenic Diet", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84979666696", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"56453341000": {"Name": "van der Louw E.", "AuthorID": "56453341000", "AffiliationID": "60015627", "AffiliationName": "Erasmus Medical Center Sophia Children's Hospital"}, "36132329000": {"Name": "van den Hurk D.", "AuthorID": "36132329000", "AffiliationID": "60070170, 60032724", "AffiliationName": "Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht"}, "23064201900": {"Name": "Neal E.", "AuthorID": "23064201900", "AffiliationID": "113759658", "AffiliationName": "Matthews Friends Clinics"}, "20834813000": {"Name": "Leiendecker B.", "AuthorID": "20834813000", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "University of Essen, Children's Hospital"}, "57190393336": {"Name": "Fitzsimmon G.", "AuthorID": "57190393336", "AffiliationID": "60018207", "AffiliationName": "Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children"}, "57190392724": {"Name": "Dority L.", "AuthorID": "57190392724", "AffiliationID": "60023222", "AffiliationName": "Medical University of South Carolina"}, "55993916500": {"Name": "Thompson L.", "AuthorID": "55993916500", "AffiliationID": "100582926", "AffiliationName": "Children's Mercy Hospital and Clinics"}, "56167514100": {"Name": "Marchi\u00f3 M.", "AuthorID": "56167514100", "AffiliationID": "60004591", "AffiliationName": "University of Modena and Reggio Emilia"}, "25932091600": {"Name": "Dudzi\u0144ska M.", "AuthorID": "25932091600", "AffiliationID": "100793952", "AffiliationName": "Center of Pediatrics and Oncology"}, "36143712100": {"Name": "Dressler A.", "AuthorID": "36143712100", "AffiliationID": "60011394", "AffiliationName": "Medical University Vienna"}, "7003881172": {"Name": "Klepper J.", "AuthorID": "7003881172", "AffiliationID": "60033330", "AffiliationName": "Klinikum Aschaffenburg-Alzenau"}, "15135263800": {"Name": "Auvin S.", "AuthorID": "15135263800", "AffiliationID": "60123796", "AffiliationName": "Pediatric Epilepsy & Child Neurology Paris-Diderot University"}, "56347087500": {"Name": "Cross J.H.", "AuthorID": "56347087500", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60012662", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Child Health, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust"}}}
