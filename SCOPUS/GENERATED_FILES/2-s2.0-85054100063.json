The majority of antibiotics are prescribed in primary care. While many existing surveillance systems can monitor trends in the quantities of antibiotics prescribed in this setting, it can be difficult to monitor the quality of prescribing as data on the condition for which prescriptions are issued are often not available. We devised a standardized methodology to facilitate the monitoring of condition-specific antibiotic prescribing in primary care. Methods We used a large computerized general practitioner database to develop a standardized methodology for routine monitoring of antimicrobial prescribing linked to clinical indications in primary care in the UK. Outputs included prescribing rate by syndrome and percentages of consultations with antibiotic prescription, for recommended antibiotic, and of recommended treatment length. Results The standardized methodology can monitor trends in proportions of common infections for which antibiotics were prescribed, the specific drugs prescribed and duration of treatment. These data can be used to help assess the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing and to assess the impact of prescribing guidelines. Conclusions We present a standardized methodology that could be applied to any suitable national or local database and adapted for use in other countries.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Primary care", "Public health"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Anti-Infective Agents", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Drug Prescriptions", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'", "Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs", "Primary Health Care", "United Kingdom", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054100063", "SubjectAreas": [["Public Health, Environmental and Occupational Health", "MEDI", "2739"]], "AuthorData": {"57199390350": {"Name": "Smith S.", "AuthorID": "57199390350", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Real-time Syndromic Surveillance Team, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "57208433940": {"Name": "Smith G.E.", "AuthorID": "57208433940", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Real-time Syndromic Surveillance Team, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "55489466500": {"Name": "Morbey R.", "AuthorID": "55489466500", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Real-time Syndromic Surveillance Team, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7005311085": {"Name": "Hawker J.I.", "AuthorID": "7005311085", "AffiliationID": "60111140", "AffiliationName": "Field Epidemiology Service, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7410016381": {"Name": "Johnson A.P.", "AuthorID": "7410016381", "AffiliationID": "60000733, 60111140", "AffiliationName": "Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance, Centre for Infectious Disease Surveillance and Control, National Infection Service, Public Health England"}, "7202941329": {"Name": "Fleming D.M.", "AuthorID": "7202941329", "AffiliationID": "60021097, 60172391", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School of Biosciences and Medicine, University of Surrey"}, "35184065400": {"Name": "Shallcross L.", "AuthorID": "35184065400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Health Informatics"}, "35944648500": {"Name": "Hayward A.C.", "AuthorID": "35944648500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Institute of Health Informatics"}}}
