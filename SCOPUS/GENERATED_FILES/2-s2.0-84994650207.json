Objective To evaluate the early postoperative morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing iRARC and conduct a critical analysis of complications using standardised reporting criteria as stratified according to urinary diversion. Design, setting, and participants A total of 134 patients underwent iRARC for bladder cancer at a single centre between June 2011 and July 2015. Intervention Radical cystectomy with iRARC. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Patient demographics, pathologic data, and 90-d perioperative mortality and complications were recorded. Complications were reported according to the Clavien-Dindo (CD) classification and stratified according to urinary diversion type and either surgical or medical complications. The chi-square test and t test were used for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Multivariable logistic regression was performed on variables with significance in univariate analysis. Results and limitations The 90-d all complication rate following ileal conduit and continent diversion was 68% and 82.4%, and major complications were 21.0% and 20.6% respectively. The 90-d mortality was 3% and 2.9% for ileal conduit and continent diversion patients, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the blood transfusion requirement was independently associated with major complications (p = 0.002) and all 30-d (p = 0.002) and 90-d (p = 0.012) major complications. Male patients were associated with 90-d major complications (p = 0.015). Critical analysis identified that surgical complications were responsible for 39.4% of all 90-d major complications. The incidence of surgical complications did not decline with increasing number of iRARC cases performed (p = 0.742, r = 0.31). Limitations of this study include its retrospective nature, limited sample size, and limited multivariate analysis due to the low number of major complications events. Conclusions Although complications following iRARC are common, most are low grade. A critical analysis identified surgical complications as a cause of major complications. Addressing this issue could have a significant impact on lowering the morbidity associated with iRARC. Patient summary We looked at the surgical outcomes in bladder cancer patients treated with minimally invasive robotic surgery. We found that surgical complications account for most major complications and previous surgical experience may be a confounding factor when interpreting results from a different centre even in a randomised trial setting. Surgical complications account for most major complications following intracorporeal robotic radical cystectomy. This study highlights the need for caution when interpreting data drawn from centres during an early adoptive period and should be considered when conducting randomised trials.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bladder cancer", "Complications", "Cystectomy", "Intracorporeal urinary diversion", "Reference standards", "Robotics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Blood Transfusion", "Cystectomy", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Postoperative Complications", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Robotic Surgical Procedures", "Sex Factors", "Urinary Bladder Neoplasms", "Urinary Diversion"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994650207", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57201942956": {"Name": "Tan W.S.", "AuthorID": "57201942956", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "56355040200": {"Name": "Sridhar A.", "AuthorID": "56355040200", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "56545193700": {"Name": "Nathan S.", "AuthorID": "56545193700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7404901815": {"Name": "Kelly J.D.", "AuthorID": "7404901815", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "30467833700": {"Name": "Lamb B.W.", "AuthorID": "30467833700", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "56372949800": {"Name": "Ahmad I.", "AuthorID": "56372949800", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60012754, 60031990", "AffiliationName": "Uro-oncology Group, Cancer Research UK, Beatson Institute, Glasgow University"}, "7201521878": {"Name": "Hines J.", "AuthorID": "7201521878", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "26030727900": {"Name": "Shaw G.", "AuthorID": "26030727900", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "7004395429": {"Name": "Briggs T.P.", "AuthorID": "7004395429", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Urology, University College London Hospital"}, "57189841956": {"Name": "Tan M.Y.", "AuthorID": "57189841956", "AffiliationID": "60001490, 60012754, 60031990", "AffiliationName": "Uro-oncology Group, Cancer Research UK, Beatson Institute, Glasgow University"}}}
