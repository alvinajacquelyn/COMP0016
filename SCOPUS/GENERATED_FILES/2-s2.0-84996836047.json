While the HKS uses a heat diffusion process to probe the local structure of a graph, the WKS attempts to do the same through wave propagation. In this paper, we propose an alternative structural descriptor that is based on continuous-time quantum walks. More specifically, we characterise the structure of a graph using its average mixing matrix. The average mixing matrix is a doubly-stochastic matrix that encodes the time-averaged behaviour of a continuous-time quantum walk on the graph. We propose to use the rows of the average mixing matrix for increasing stopping times to develop a novel signature, the Average Mixing Matrix Signature (AMMS). We perform an extensive range of experiments and we show that the proposed signature is robust under structural perturbations of the original graphs and it outperforms both the HKS and WKS when used as a node descriptor in a graph matching task.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Average mixing matrix", "Graph characterisation", "Quantum walks", "Structural descriptor"], "IndexKeywords": ["Continuous-time quantum walks", "Doubly stochastic matrix", "Graph characterisation", "Heat kernel signatures", "Mixing matrix", "Quantum walk", "Structural descriptor", "Structural perturbation"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996836047", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"7401505409": {"Name": "Rossi L.", "AuthorID": "7401505409", "AffiliationID": "60014551", "AffiliationName": "School of Engineering and Applied Science, Aston University"}, "8984521800": {"Name": "Severini S.", "AuthorID": "8984521800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "56279109000": {"Name": "Torsello A.", "AuthorID": "56279109000", "AffiliationID": "60013494", "AffiliationName": "DAIS, Universit\u00e0 Ca\u2019 Foscari Venezia"}}}
