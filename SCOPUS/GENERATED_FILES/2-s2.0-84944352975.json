However, amongst treatment completers, only 40\u201350 % have a full and lasting response. The enhanced CB model (CB-E), upon which the enhanced version of the CB treatment was based, extended the original approach by including four additional maintenance factors. This study evaluated and compared both CB models in a large clinical treatment seeking sample (N = 679), applying both DSM-IV and DSM-5 criteria for bulimic-type eating disorders. Application of the DSM-5 criteria reduced the number of cases of DSM-IV bulimic-type eating disorders not otherwise specified to 29.6 %. Structural equation modelling analysis indicated that (a) although both models provided a good fit to the data, the CB-E model accounted for a greater proportion of variance in eating-disordered behaviours than the original one, (b) interpersonal problems, clinical perfectionism and low self-esteem were indirectly associated with dietary restraint through over-evaluation of shape and weight, (c) interpersonal problems and mood intolerance were directly linked to binge eating, whereas restraint only indirectly affected binge eating through mood intolerance, suggesting that factors other than restraint may play a more critical role in the maintenance of binge eating. In terms of strength of the associations, differences across DSM-5 bulimic-type eating disorder diagnostic groups were not observed. The results are discussed with reference to theory and research, including neurobiological findings and recent hypotheses.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Binge eating", "Bulimic-type eating disorders", "Cognitive-behavioural theory", "DSM-5", "Latent variable structural equation modelling", "Maintenance factors"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Binge-Eating Disorder", "Bulimia Nervosa", "Chi-Square Distribution", "Cognitive Therapy", "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders", "Female", "Humans", "Interpersonal Relations", "Male", "Models, Psychological", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944352975", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"55366742000": {"Name": "Dakanalis A.", "AuthorID": "55366742000", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "56470353500": {"Name": "Zanetti M.A.", "AuthorID": "56470353500", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia"}, "7003818736": {"Name": "Carr\u00e0 G.", "AuthorID": "7003818736", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Psychiatry, University College of London"}, "14059513700": {"Name": "Calogero R.", "AuthorID": "14059513700", "AffiliationID": "60010818", "AffiliationName": "School of Psychology, University of Kent"}, "36617443000": {"Name": "Gaudio S.", "AuthorID": "36617443000", "AffiliationID": "60005308", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Integrated Research, Area of Diagnostic Imaging, University \u201cCampus Bio-Medico di Roma\u201d"}, "7801603470": {"Name": "Caccialanza R.", "AuthorID": "7801603470", "AffiliationID": "60026556", "AffiliationName": "Nutrition and Dietetics Service, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo"}, "56962750600": {"Name": "Riva G.", "AuthorID": "56962750600", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "Applied Technology for Neuro-Psychology Laboratory, Istituto Auxologico Italiano, IRCCS"}, "56926906800": {"Name": "Clerici M.", "AuthorID": "56926906800", "AffiliationID": "60012306", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences and Biomedical Technologies, University of Milano-Bicocca, Medical School"}}}
