The external regulatory era has improved quality and safety standards but there is still variable practice, with specific risks illuminated by a number of clinical incidents. Viable CD34+ cell assays may fail to indicate significant losses in progenitor function during storage, particularly after cryopreservation, and there is a need to develop an alternative, real time functional assay to replace colony assays. The ultimate guide to potency and successful cell processing for haematopoietic progenitor cell products is prompt and reproducible engraftment and close monitoring is essential for safety and quality control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["cryopreservation", "engraftment kinetics", "potency", "quality control", "viability"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cryopreservation", "Graft Survival", "Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation", "Hematopoietic Stem Cells", "Humans", "Quality Control", "Transplantation, Autologous"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991735321", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"]], "AuthorData": {"16937816500": {"Name": "Watts M.J.", "AuthorID": "16937816500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "14634099500": {"Name": "Linch D.C.", "AuthorID": "14634099500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}}}
