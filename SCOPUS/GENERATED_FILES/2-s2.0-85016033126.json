The prevalence of ocular diseases is rising, and diseases such as glaucoma, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) are the leading causes of blindness in developed countries. Identifying these diseases in mass screening programmes is time-consuming, labor-intensive and the diagnosis can be subjective. The use of an automated computer aided diagnosis system will reduce the time taken for analysis and will also reduce the inter-observer subjective variabilities in image interpretation. In this work, we propose one such system for the automatic classification of normal from abnormal (DR, AMD, glaucoma) images. We had a total of 404 normal and 1082 abnormal fundus images in our database. As the first step, 2D-Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) decomposition on the fundus images of two classes was performed. Subsequently, energy features and various entropies namely Yager, Renyi, Kapoor, Shannon, and Fuzzy were extracted from the decomposed images. Then, adaptive synthetic sampling approach was applied to balance the normal and abnormal datasets. Next, the extracted features were ranked according to the significances using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Thereupon, the ranked and selected features were used to train the random forest classifier using stratified 10-fold cross validation. Overall, the proposed system presented a performance rate of 92.48%, and a sensitivity and specificity of 89.37% and 95.58% respectively using 15 features. This novel system shows promise in detecting abnormal fundus images, and hence, could be a valuable adjunct eye health screening tool that could be employed in polyclinics, and thereby reduce the workload of specialists at hospitals.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Continuous wavelet transform", "Diabetic retinopathy", "Fundus", "Glaucoma"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age-related macular degeneration", "Continuous Wavelet Transform", "Diabetic retinopathy", "Fundus", "Glaucoma", "Databases, Factual", "Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological", "Entropy", "Fundus Oculi", "Glaucoma", "Humans", "Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted", "Retina", "Retinal Diseases", "Wavelet Analysis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85016033126", "SubjectAreas": [["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Health Informatics", "MEDI", "2718"]], "AuthorData": {"55905807100": {"Name": "Koh J.E.W.", "AuthorID": "55905807100", "AffiliationID": "60012607", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Ngee Ann Polytechnic"}, "7004510847": {"Name": "Acharya U.R.", "AuthorID": "7004510847", "AffiliationID": "60029157", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, University of Malaya"}, "57057106000": {"Name": "Hagiwara Y.", "AuthorID": "57057106000", "AffiliationID": "60012607", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Ngee Ann Polytechnic"}, "26644487800": {"Name": "Tan J.H.", "AuthorID": "26644487800", "AffiliationID": "60012607", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Ngee Ann Polytechnic"}, "23134713400": {"Name": "Chua K.C.", "AuthorID": "23134713400", "AffiliationID": "60012607", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Ngee Ann Polytechnic"}, "37079412500": {"Name": "Raghavendra U.", "AuthorID": "37079412500", "AffiliationID": "60028079, 60016524", "AffiliationName": "Department of Instrumentation and Control Engineering, Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal University"}, "35263314400": {"Name": "Sree S.V.", "AuthorID": "35263314400", "AffiliationID": "112668453", "AffiliationName": "Visiting Scientist, Global Biomedical Technologies"}, "14419627700": {"Name": "Bhandary S.V.", "AuthorID": "14419627700", "AffiliationID": "60015855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Kasturba Medical College"}, "57193714175": {"Name": "Rao A.K.", "AuthorID": "57193714175", "AffiliationID": "60015855", "AffiliationName": "Department of Ophthalmology, Kasturba Medical College"}, "35547907400": {"Name": "Sivaprasad S.", "AuthorID": "35547907400", "AffiliationID": "112586584", "AffiliationName": "Consultant ophthalmologist, NIHR Moorfields Biomedical Research Centre"}, "9846887300": {"Name": "Laude A.", "AuthorID": "9846887300", "AffiliationID": "60002481, 60095080", "AffiliationName": "National Healthcare Group Eye Institute, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore"}, "7201891601": {"Name": "Tong L.", "AuthorID": "7201891601", "AffiliationID": "60026680, 60017161", "AffiliationName": "Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore"}}}
