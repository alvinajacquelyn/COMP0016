End users find wireless access highly convenient for mobile communication. However, limited spectrum availability at microwave frequencies results in per-user transmission rates limited to much lower values, e.g., 500 Mb/s for 5-GHz band IEEE 802.11ac. Extending the high data-rate capacity of optical fiber transmission to wireless devices requires greatly increased carrier frequencies. This paper will describe how photonic techniques can enable ultrahigh capacity wireless data distribution and transmission using signals at millimeter-wave and TeraHertz (THz) frequencies.", "AuthorKeywords": ["microwave photonics", "millimeter (mm)-wave generation", "optical heterodyne", "optical mixing", "optical phase lock loops", "photonic integrated circuits", "semiconductor lasers", "Terms-Broadband communication"], "IndexKeywords": ["Broadband Communication", "Microwave Photonics", "Millimeter (mm)-wave", "Optical heterodyne", "Optical mixing", "Optical phase", "Photonic integrated circuits"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84923602998", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"7004751445": {"Name": "Seeds A.J.", "AuthorID": "7004751445", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "55600338800": {"Name": "Shams H.", "AuthorID": "55600338800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "6701843369": {"Name": "Fice M.J.", "AuthorID": "6701843369", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}, "7006454070": {"Name": "Renaud C.C.", "AuthorID": "7006454070", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London"}}}
