In this modified theory, Friedmann equations are formulated for any spatial curvature. These equations can be presented into the form of first law of thermodynamics for ThdS\u02c6h+ThdiS\u02c6h+WdV=dE, where diS\u02c6h is an extra entropy term because of the non-equilibrium presentation of the equations and ThdS\u02c6h+WdV=dE for the equilibrium presentation. The generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) is expressed in an inclusive form where these results can be represented in GR, f(R) and f(R,\u03d5) gravities. Finally to check the validity of GSLT, we take some particular models and produce constraints of the parameters.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dark energy theory", "Modified gravity", "Thermodynamics"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84994742895", "SubjectAreas": [["Astronomy and Astrophysics", "PHYS", "3103"], ["Space and Planetary Science", "EART", "1912"]], "AuthorData": {"57205570313": {"Name": "Zubair M.", "AuthorID": "57205570313", "AffiliationID": "60056259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, COMSATS, Institute of Information Technology"}, "57189092682": {"Name": "Kousar F.", "AuthorID": "57189092682", "AffiliationID": "60056259", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, COMSATS, Institute of Information Technology"}, "55811800800": {"Name": "Bahamonde S.", "AuthorID": "55811800800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mathematics, University College London"}}}
