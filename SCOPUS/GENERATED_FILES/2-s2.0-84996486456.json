She established the Records Preservation Section of the British Records Association, she edited historical records and wrote for publication in works of reference including local and British Record Society volumes, the Victoria County History of England and the Complete Peerage, and she established an independent and successful business as a record agent, Stokes and Cox. The article is the first in a planned series which will study the lives and professional contributions of pioneering women archivists in England. An explanation of the background to this work, a literature review and a justification of the need for this new field of study are articulated in Shepherd\u2019s chapter, \u2018Hidden voices in the archives: pioneering women archivists in early twentieth century England\u2019 (Shepherd in Engaging with archives and records: histories and theories. Facet Publishing, London, 2016). In line with the collective biographical approach outlined there, this paper will consider Miss Stokes\u2019s family and educational background, her friendships, charitable work and her professional activities and projects, seeking to set her into the context of her own times.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Archival history", "Ethel Stokes", "Joan Wake", "Twentieth-century archives in England", "Women archivists"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84996486456", "SubjectAreas": [["History", "ARTS", "1202"], ["Library and Information Sciences", "SOCI", "3309"]], "AuthorData": {"14036358100": {"Name": "Shepherd E.", "AuthorID": "14036358100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Information Studies, UCL"}}}
