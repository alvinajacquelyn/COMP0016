Conventional shoreline change metrics are best suited to resolving progressive quasi-linear trends. However, coastal change is often highly non-linear and may exhibit complex behaviour including trend-reversals. This paper advocates a secondary level of investigation based on a cluster analysis to resolve a more complete range of coastal behaviours. Cluster-based segmentation of shoreline behaviour is demonstrated with reference to a regional-scale case study of the Suffolk coast, eastern UK. An exceptionally comprehensive suite of shoreline datasets covering the period 1881 to 2015 is used to examine both centennial- and intra-decadal scale change in shoreline position. Analysis of shoreline position changes at a 100 m alongshore interval along 74 km of coastline reveals a number of distinct behaviours. The suite of behaviours varies with the timescale of analysis. There is little evidence of regionally coherent shoreline change. Rather, the analyses reveal a complex interaction between met-ocean forcing, inherited geological and geomorphological controls, and evolving anthropogenic intervention that drives changing foci of erosion and deposition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cluster analysis", "Coastal erosion", "Large-scale coastal behaviour", "Mesoscale", "Suffolk", "UK"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85010199531", "SubjectAreas": [["Earth-Surface Processes", "EART", "1904"]], "AuthorData": {"10540040600": {"Name": "Burningham H.", "AuthorID": "10540040600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Coastal and Estuarine Unit, UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}, "55597277200": {"Name": "French J.", "AuthorID": "55597277200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Coastal and Estuarine Unit, UCL Department of Geography, University College London"}}}
