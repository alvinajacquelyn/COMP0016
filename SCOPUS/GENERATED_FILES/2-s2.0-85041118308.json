PD patients with Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations (PDGBA) present with even more cognitive decline than seen in PDidiopathic. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether CSF profiles of A\u03b2 and tau are associated with the prominent cognitive impairment in PDGBA. Methods: CSF levels of A\u03b21-42, t-Tau, p-Tau, and total alpha-synuclein were assessed in 479 participants (50 PDGBA, 308 PDidiopathic, 121 healthy controls). Results: Older age was associated with cognitive impairment in PDGBA and PDidiopathic. Despite prominent cognitive impairment, PDGBA showed similar CSF levels of A\u03b21-42, t-Tau, and p-Tau as seen in healthy controls. In contrast, lower levels of A\u03b21-42 and higher levels of t-Tau and p-Tau were associated with worse cognitive performance in PDidiopathic. Conclusions: The prominent cognitive impairment in PDGBA seems not primarily associated with A\u03b2 and Tau profiles in CSF. \u00a9 2017 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Abeta", "alpha-synuclein", "CSF", "GBA", "Parkinson", "Tau"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Amyloid beta-Peptides", "Cognition Disorders", "Female", "Glucosylceramidase", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mutation", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Parkinson Disease", "Peptide Fragments", "Retrospective Studies", "Severity of Illness Index", "Statistics, Nonparametric", "tau Proteins", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041118308", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"23469786200": {"Name": "Lerche S.", "AuthorID": "23469786200", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "57207902594": {"Name": "Schulte C.", "AuthorID": "57207902594", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "36118335700": {"Name": "Srulijes K.", "AuthorID": "36118335700", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "45661638400": {"Name": "Pilotto A.", "AuthorID": "45661638400", "AffiliationID": "60015300", "AffiliationName": "Neurology Unit, Department of Clinical and Experimental Sciences, University of Brescia"}, "57188593621": {"Name": "Rattay T.W.", "AuthorID": "57188593621", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "41561396400": {"Name": "Hauser A.K.", "AuthorID": "41561396400", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "8572597400": {"Name": "Stransky E.", "AuthorID": "8572597400", "AffiliationID": "60084331, 60017246", "AffiliationName": "Center of Neurology, Department of Neurodegeneration and Hertie-Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of Tuebingen"}, "53863093100": {"Name": "Deuschle C.", "AuthorID": "53863093100", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "36716581700": {"Name": "Liepelt-Scarfone I.", "AuthorID": "36716581700", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "35519668300": {"Name": "Gasser T.", "AuthorID": "35519668300", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "57206457563": {"Name": "Maetzler W.", "AuthorID": "57206457563", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Christian-Albrechts University"}, "57203205476": {"Name": "Berg D.", "AuthorID": "57203205476", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Christian-Albrechts University"}, "36058538900": {"Name": "Brockmann K.", "AuthorID": "36058538900", "AffiliationID": "60017246, 60103674", "AffiliationName": "German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Tuebingen"}, "6603155602": {"Name": "Csoti I.", "AuthorID": "6603155602", "AffiliationID": "111696054", "AffiliationName": "Gertrudis Klinik, Parkinson-Center"}, "6603087725": {"Name": "Lachmann I.", "AuthorID": "6603087725", "AffiliationID": "60138407", "AffiliationName": "AJ Roboscreen GmbH"}, "6701454676": {"Name": "Zetterberg H.", "AuthorID": "6701454676", "AffiliationID": "60019953", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Neuroscience, UCL Institute of Neurology"}}}
