Two principal neural models of vocal imitation have emerged from a consideration of nonhuman animals. One hypothesis suggests that putative mirror neurons in the inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis of Broca\u2019s area may be important for imitation. An alternative hypothesis derived from the study of songbirds suggests that the corticostriate motor pathway performs sensorimotor processes that are specific to vocal imitation. Using fMRI with a sparse eventrelated sampling design, we investigated the neural basis of vocal imitation in humans by comparing imitative vocal production of pitch sequences with both nonimitative vocal production and pitch discrimination. The strongest difference between these tasks was found in the putamen bilaterally, providing a striking parallel to the role of the analogous region in songbirds. Other areas preferentially activated during imitation included the orofacial motor cortex, Rolandic operculum, and SMA, which together outline the corticostriate motor loop. No differences were seen in the inferior frontal gyrus. The corticostriate system thus appears to be the central pathway for vocal imitation in humans, as predicted from an analogy with songbirds.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acoustic Stimulation", "Adult", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Female", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Imitative Behavior", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Models, Neurological", "Pitch Discrimination", "Pitch Perception", "Voice", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959282755", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"37004227400": {"Name": "Belyk M.", "AuthorID": "37004227400", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "McMaster University"}, "55712926200": {"Name": "Brown S.", "AuthorID": "55712926200", "AffiliationID": "60031828", "AffiliationName": "McMaster University"}, "6506385361": {"Name": "Pfordresher P.Q.", "AuthorID": "6506385361", "AffiliationID": "60032083", "AffiliationName": "State University"}, "7004825097": {"Name": "Liotti M.", "AuthorID": "7004825097", "AffiliationID": "60018491", "AffiliationName": "Simon Fraser University"}}}
