In this study we show that astrocytes, playing an important role in regulation of information transmission between neurons, may contribute to a generation of positive integrated information in neuronal ensembles. Analytically and numerically we show that the presence of astrocytic regulation of neurotransmission may be essential for this information attribute in neuroastrocytic ensembles. Moreover, the proposed \"spiking-bursting\" mechanism of generating positive integrated information is shown to be generic and not limited to neuron-astrocyte networks and is given a complete analytic description.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Analytic descriptions", "Information exchanges", "Information transmission", "Integrated informations", "Quantitative measures", "Astrocytes", "Models, Neurological", "Neurons"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85060821999", "SubjectAreas": [["Statistical and Nonlinear Physics", "PHYS", "3109"], ["Statistics and Probability", "MATH", "2613"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"]], "AuthorData": {"8958614400": {"Name": "Kanakov O.", "AuthorID": "8958614400", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "55328272900": {"Name": "Gordleeva S.", "AuthorID": "55328272900", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "57205610474": {"Name": "Ermolaeva A.", "AuthorID": "57205610474", "AffiliationID": "60008673", "AffiliationName": "Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod"}, "7103103296": {"Name": "Zaikin A.", "AuthorID": "7103103296", "AffiliationID": "60010188", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Pediatrics, Sechenov University"}, "56152342900": {"Name": "Jalan S.", "AuthorID": "56152342900", "AffiliationID": "60104350", "AffiliationName": "Complex Systems Lab, Discipline of Physics, Indian Institute of Technology Indore"}}}
