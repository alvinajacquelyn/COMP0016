Potentially, these phototrophic eukaryotes could be used for the low-cost synthesis of valuable recombinant products such as bioactive metabolites and therapeutic proteins. The algal chloroplast in particular represents an attractive target for such genetic engineering, both because it houses major metabolic pathways and because foreign genes can be targeted to specific loci within the chloroplast genome, resulting in high-level, stable expression. However, routine methods for chloroplast genetic engineering are currently available only for one species\u2014Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\u2014and even here, there are limitations to the existing technology, including the need for an expensive biolistic device for DNA delivery, the lack of robust expression vectors, and the undesirable use of antibiotic resistance markers. Here, we describe a new strain and vectors for targeted insertion of transgenes into a neutral chloroplast locus that (i) allow scar-less fusion of a transgenic coding sequence to the promoter/5\u2032UTR element of the highly expressed endogenous genes psaA or atpA, (ii) employ the endogenous gene psbH as an effective but benign selectable marker, and (iii) ensure the successful integration of the transgene construct in all transformant lines. Transformation is achieved by a simple and cheap method of agitation of a DNA/cell suspension with glass beads, with selection based on the phototrophic rescue of a cell wall-deficient \u0394psbH strain. We demonstrate the utility of these tools in the creation of a transgenic line that produces high levels of functional human growth hormone.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Chlamydomonas", "Chloroplast", "Genetic engineering", "Human growth hormone"], "IndexKeywords": ["Antibiotic resistance", "Chlamydomonas", "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", "Chloroplast", "Chloroplast genetic engineerings", "Human growth hormone", "Industrial biotechnology", "Therapeutic protein", "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii", "Chloroplasts", "Genetic Engineering", "Genetic Vectors", "Human Growth Hormone", "Humans", "Promoter Regions, Genetic", "Transformation, Genetic", "Transgenes"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84958780096", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology", "IMMU", "2402"]], "AuthorData": {"57130098800": {"Name": "Waterhouse J.", "AuthorID": "57130098800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Algal Research Group, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "16246763000": {"Name": "Young R.", "AuthorID": "16246763000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Algal Research Group, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "55541213300": {"Name": "Economou C.", "AuthorID": "55541213300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Algal Research Group, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "6701719502": {"Name": "Purton S.", "AuthorID": "6701719502", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Algal Research Group, Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology, University College London"}, "55542763300": {"Name": "Wannathong T.", "AuthorID": "55542763300", "AffiliationID": "60018809", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Silpakorn University"}}}
