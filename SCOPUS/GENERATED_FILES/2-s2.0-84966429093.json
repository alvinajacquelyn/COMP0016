Therefore, a novel project characteristic is developed that reflects the value accrue within a project. This characteristic, called project regularity, is expressed in terms of the newly introduced regular/irregular-indicator RI. The widely accepted management system of earned value management (EVM) forms the basis for evaluation of the new characteristic. More concretely, the influence of project regularity on EVM forecasting accuracy is assessed, and is shown to be significant for both time and cost forecasting. Moreover, this effect appears to be stronger than that of the widely used characteristic of project seriality expressed by the serial/parallel-indicator SP. Therefore, project regularity could also be useful as an input parameter for project network generators. Furthermore, the introduction of project regularity can provide project managers with a more accurate indication of the time and cost forecasting accuracy that is to be expected for a certain project and, correspondingly, of how a project should be built up in order to obtain more reliable forecasts during project control.", "AuthorKeywords": ["earned value management", "empirical database", "Monte Carlo simulation", "project control system", "Project management", "time and cost forecasting"], "IndexKeywords": ["Cost forecasting", "Earned value management", "Forecasting accuracy", "Management systems", "Project characteristics", "Project control systems", "Project managers", "Project networks"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84966429093", "SubjectAreas": [["Control and Systems Engineering", "ENGI", "2207"], ["Information Systems", "COMP", "1710"]], "AuthorData": {"56395481500": {"Name": "Batselier J.", "AuthorID": "56395481500", "AffiliationID": "60033316", "AffiliationName": "Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Ghent University"}, "6602303040": {"Name": "Vanhoucke M.", "AuthorID": "6602303040", "AffiliationID": "60176025, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL School of Management, University College London"}}}
