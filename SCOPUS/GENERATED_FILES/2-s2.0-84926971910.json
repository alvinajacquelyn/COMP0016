Therefore, we compared the effects of IgG from VT+/PM- and VT-/PM+ subjects on human first-trimester trophoblast (HTR8) cells. Method of study: HTR-8 cells were incubated with APS VT+/PM-, APS VT-/PM+ or healthy control (HC) IgG. We measured trophoblast invasion by cell invasion assay; mRNA expression of TLR4 and adaptor proteins; phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, NF\u03baB and ERK; and expression of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6. Results: VT-/PM+ IgG, but not VT+/PM- IgG significantly reduced HTR-8 invasion. The effects on invasion were blocked by TLR-4 inhibition. Neither VT+/PM- nor VT-/PM+ IgG altered MyD88 mRNA expression, phosphorylation of signalling molecules or cytokine expression. Conclusions: VT-/PM+ IgG exert functionally relevant effects on human trophoblast cells but VT+/PM- IgG do not.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Antiphospholipid", "Obstetric", "TLR4", "Trophoblast"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antibodies, Antiphospholipid", "Antiphospholipid Syndrome", "Cell Line", "Female", "Humans", "Immunoglobulin G", "Pregnancy", "Pregnancy Complications", "Trophoblasts"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84926971910", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Reproductive Medicine", "MEDI", "2743"], ["Obstetrics and Gynecology", "MEDI", "2729"]], "AuthorData": {"57197125253": {"Name": "Poulton K.", "AuthorID": "57197125253", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "8504949600": {"Name": "Ripoll V.M.", "AuthorID": "8504949600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "15766296400": {"Name": "Pericleous C.", "AuthorID": "15766296400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "7003289700": {"Name": "Ioannou Y.", "AuthorID": "7003289700", "AffiliationID": "60018207, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Arthritis Research UK Centre for Adolescent Rheumatology, UCL, UCL Hospital and Great Ormond Street Hospital"}, "57212819228": {"Name": "Rahman A.", "AuthorID": "57212819228", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "56506767800": {"Name": "Giles I.P.", "AuthorID": "56506767800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, Rayne Institute, University College London (UCL)"}, "35376419500": {"Name": "Meroni P.L.", "AuthorID": "35376419500", "AffiliationID": "60006646", "AffiliationName": "IRCCS Istituto Auxologico Italiano"}, "57190092627": {"Name": "Gerosa M.", "AuthorID": "57190092627", "AffiliationID": "60030318, 60010364", "AffiliationName": "Division of Rheumatology, Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, Istituto G Pini, University of Milan"}}}
