Genetic variation in CNTNAP2, the gene encoding Caspr2, has been linked to several neurodevelopmental conditions, yet pathophysiological effects of CNTNAP2 mutations on axonal physiology and brain myelination are unknown. Here, we have investigated mouse mutants for Cntnap2 and found profound deficiencies in the clustering of Kv1-family potassium channels in the juxtaparanodes of brain myelinated axons. These deficits are associated with a change in the waveform of axonal action potentials and increases in postsynaptic excitatory responses. We also observed that the normal process of myelination is delayed in Cntnap2 mutant mice. This later phenotype is a likely modulator of the developmental expressivity of the stereotyped motor behaviors that characterize Cntnap2 mutant mice. Altogether, our results reveal a mechanism linked to white matter conductivity through which mutation of CNTNAP2 may affect neurodevelopmental outcomes.", "AuthorKeywords": ["axonal action potentials", "Caspr2", "GABAergic interneurons", "Kv1-family potassium channels", "myelin"], "IndexKeywords": ["Action Potentials", "Animals", "Axons", "Cerebral Cortex", "Corpus Callosum", "Developmental Disabilities", "Male", "Membrane Proteins", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Mice, Transgenic", "Nerve Fibers, Myelinated", "Nerve Tissue Proteins", "Stereotypic Movement Disorder", "Synaptic Transmission"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048079479", "SubjectAreas": [["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Cellular and Molecular Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2804"]], "AuthorData": {"7404341654": {"Name": "Scott R.", "AuthorID": "7404341654", "AffiliationID": "60029767, 60017107, 60006754", "AffiliationName": "Instituto de Neurociencias, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, Universidad Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez"}, "36058277300": {"Name": "Bartolini G.", "AuthorID": "36058277300", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "7005583174": {"Name": "Mar\u00edn O.", "AuthorID": "7005583174", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London"}, "56736483800": {"Name": "S\u00e1nchez-Aguilera A.", "AuthorID": "56736483800", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London"}, "55883309100": {"Name": "Lim L.", "AuthorID": "55883309100", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London"}, "24476546400": {"Name": "Dehorter N.", "AuthorID": "24476546400", "AffiliationID": "60011520", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Developmental Neurobiology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London"}, "57202532982": {"Name": "Bae S.E.", "AuthorID": "57202532982", "AffiliationID": "60011520, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Neurodevelopmental Disorders, King's College London"}, "56303782300": {"Name": "Van Elst K.", "AuthorID": "56303782300", "AffiliationID": "60032724, 60007989", "AffiliationName": "Department of Translational Neuroscience, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University"}, "6602425807": {"Name": "Kas M.J.H.", "AuthorID": "6602425807", "AffiliationID": "60010023", "AffiliationName": "Groningen Institute for Evolutionary Life Sciences, University of Groningen"}, "7004125635": {"Name": "Peles E.", "AuthorID": "7004125635", "AffiliationID": "60017563", "AffiliationName": "Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Weizmann Institute of Science"}, "35432317200": {"Name": "Bruining H.", "AuthorID": "35432317200", "AffiliationID": "60032724", "AffiliationName": "Department of Psychiatry, Brain Center Rudolf Magnus, University Medical Center Utrecht"}}}
