{"Title": "Role of Cortical Auditory Evoked Potentials in Reducing the Age at Hearing Aid Fitting in Children With Hearing Loss Identified by Newborn Hearing Screening", "Year": 2017, "Source": "Trends Hear.", "Volume": "21", "Issue": null, "Art.No": null, "PageStart": null, "PageEnd": null, "CitedBy": 7, "DOI": "10.1177/2331216517744094", "Link": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85054784322&origin=inward", "Abstract": "\u00a9 The Author(s) 2017.Recording of free-field cortical auditory evoked potential (CAEP) responses to speech tokens was introduced into the audiology management for infants with a permanent childhood hearing impairment (PCHI) during 2011\u20132015 at a U.K. service. Children with bilateral PCHI were studied from two sequential cohorts. Thirty-four children had followed an audiology pathway prior to CAEP introduction, and 44 children followed a pathway after the introduction of CAEP and were tested with unaided and aided CAEP responses. Data analysis explored the age of diagnosis, hearing aid fitting, and referral for cochlear implant (CI) assessment for each of these groups. CAEP offered a novel educative process for the parents and audiologists supporting decision-making for hearing aid fitting and CI referral. Delays in hearing aid fitting and CI referral were categorized as being due to the audiologist\u2019s recommendation or parental choice. Results showed that the median age of hearing aid fitting prior to CAEP introduction was 9.2 months. After the inclusion of CAEP recording in the infant pathways, it was 3.9 months. This reduction was attributable to earlier fitting of hearing aids for children with mild and moderate hearing losses, for which the median age fell from 19 to 5 months. Children with profound hearing loss were referred for CI assessment at a significantly earlier age following the introduction of CAEP. Although there has also been a national trend for earlier hearing aid fitting in children, the current study demonstrates that the inclusion of CAEP recording in the pathway facilitated earlier hearing aid fitting for milder impairments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["children", "cochlear implant", "cortical auditory evoked potentials", "hearing aid", "Universal Neonatal Hearing Screen"], "IndexKeywords": ["Age Factors", "Auditory Cortex", "Cochlear Implants", "Deafness", "Evoked Potentials, Auditory", "Female", "Hearing Aids", "Hearing Loss", "Humans", "Infant", "Language", "London", "Male", "Persons With Hearing Impairments", "Prosthesis Fitting", "Referral and Consultation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054784322", "SubjectAreas": [["Otorhinolaryngology", "MEDI", "2733"], ["Speech and Hearing", "HEAL", "3616"]], "AuthorData": {"57212694408": {"Name": "Mehta K.", "AuthorID": "57212694408", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Audiology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "6701673135": {"Name": "Watkin P.", "AuthorID": "6701673135", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Audiology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "7202508655": {"Name": "Baldwin M.", "AuthorID": "7202508655", "AffiliationID": "60020849", "AffiliationName": "Department of Audiology, Whipps Cross University Hospital"}, "6603562749": {"Name": "Marriage J.", "AuthorID": "6603562749", "AffiliationID": "101851384", "AffiliationName": "Chears Ltd"}, "8726278400": {"Name": "Mahon M.", "AuthorID": "8726278400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}, "7006164240": {"Name": "Vickers D.", "AuthorID": "7006164240", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Psychology and Language Sciences, University College London"}}}
