All rights reserved. No commercial use is permitted unless otherwise expressly granted.While appendicectomy has been considered the mainstay of treatment for children with acute appendicitis for many decades, there has been a great deal of recent interest in non-operative treatment (NOT) with antibiotics alone. Initial results suggest that many children with appendicitis can indeed be safely treated with NOT and can be spared the surgeon's knife. Many as yet unanswered questions remain, however, before NOT can be considered a realistic and reliable alternative to surgery. This review summaries current knowledge and understanding of the role of NOT in children with appendicitis and outlines and discusses the outstanding knowledge gaps.", "AuthorKeywords": ["appendicitis", "evidence-based medicine", "paediatric surgery"], "IndexKeywords": ["Acute Disease", "Anti-Bacterial Agents", "Appendectomy", "Appendicitis", "Child", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic", "Research Design"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85056873312", "SubjectAreas": [["Pediatrics, Perinatology and Child Health", "MEDI", "2735"]], "AuthorData": {"7201554532": {"Name": "Hall N.J.", "AuthorID": "7201554532", "AffiliationID": "60025287, 60021722, 60025225", "AffiliationName": "University Surgery Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital"}, "7102181886": {"Name": "Eaton S.", "AuthorID": "7102181886", "AffiliationID": "60012662", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Biology and Cancer Programme, UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health"}}}
