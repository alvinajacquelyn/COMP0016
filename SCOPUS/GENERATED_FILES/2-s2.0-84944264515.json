We observe both suppression (in the stop-band) and enhancement (at the high-energy band-edge) of the photoluminescence. Time-resolved measurements also reveal a concomitant modification of the emission lifetime that is enhanced at the band-edge and suppressed within the stop-band, thus confirming a variation of the radiative decay rate of the excitations in such photonic nanostructures. We propose two examples of fluorescent photonic composite systems. The first consists of a hybrid Si-organic system, obtained by infiltration of the polymer inside a rugate filter (a 1D photonic crystal). The second example is a fully organic system obtained by self-assembling of solvent-compatible microspheres-polymer system for obtaining a synthetic opal (a 3D photonic crystal) with a uniform distribution of the emitting material across the photonic structure.", "AuthorKeywords": ["1D photonic crystals", "3D photonic crystals", "Conjugated polymers", "Conjugated polyrotaxanes", "Functional materials @ photonic crystals", "Hybrid photonic crystals", "Light emission", "Opal", "Photoluminescence", "Photophysics", "Purcell effect", "Rugate filters", "Self-assembly", "Silicon", "Spontaneous emission"], "IndexKeywords": ["1-D photonic crystal", "3D photonic crystals", "Hybrid photonic crystals", "Opal", "Photophysics", "Polyrotaxanes", "Purcell effect", "Rugate filter"], "DocumentType": "Book", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84944264515", "SubjectAreas": [["Engineering (all)", "ENGI", "2200"], ["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"]], "AuthorData": {"55668072300": {"Name": "Robbiano V.", "AuthorID": "55668072300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "7006071546": {"Name": "Cacialli F.", "AuthorID": "7006071546", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60175883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy and London Centre for Nanotechnology, University College London"}, "55845430900": {"Name": "Di Stasio F.", "AuthorID": "55845430900", "AffiliationID": "60102151", "AffiliationName": "Nanochemistry Department, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia"}, "35191137800": {"Name": "Surdo S.", "AuthorID": "35191137800", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa"}, "6603446550": {"Name": "Barillaro G.", "AuthorID": "6603446550", "AffiliationID": "60028868", "AffiliationName": "Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell\u2019Informazione, Universit\u00e0 di Pisa"}, "36887798900": {"Name": "Mian S.", "AuthorID": "36887798900", "AffiliationID": "60027883", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, McDaniel College"}}}
