All rights reserved.In multi-band carrier-less amplitude and phase modulation (m-CAP), the transmitter and receiver pulse shaping filters have a significant impact on the signal performance. Since m-CAP is an emerging and promising modulation format for visible light communications (VLC), it is necessary to balance the system performance and the filter length, due to limited integration density in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAS). In this paper we investigate the m-CAP VLC system performance for different number of sub-bands m = {2, 5, 10} under varying finite impulse response (FIR) filter parameters, such as the filter length Lf and the roll-off factor \u03b2. We show that increasing both \u03b2 and Lf improves the bit error rate (BER) performance of the system substantially. We demonstrate that a BER target of 10-4 is achieved using Lf \u2264 12 symbols for m = 5 and 10 for low order subcarriers. Moreover, the BER limit is attained for \u03b2 = 0.2 by all subcarriers, except the last two for m = 5 and 10, which is a significant improvement, even considering the slightly increased excess bandwidth in comparison to the literature.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Carrier-less Am4plitude and phase modulation", "Filters", "Roll-off factor", "Visible light communications"], "IndexKeywords": ["Amplitude and phase modulations", "Bit error rate (BER) performance", "Carrier-less", "Integration density", "Pulse shaping filters", "Signal performance", "Transmitter and receiver", "Visible light communications (VLC)"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84991373126", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"], ["Computer Networks and Communications", "COMP", "1705"], ["Communication", "SOCI", "3315"]], "AuthorData": {"6508134236": {"Name": "Chvojka P.", "AuthorID": "6508134236", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "8346275300": {"Name": "Zvanovec S.", "AuthorID": "8346275300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "56373334300": {"Name": "Pesek P.", "AuthorID": "56373334300", "AffiliationID": "60013323", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electromagnetic Field, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague"}, "55103012600": {"Name": "Haigh P.A.", "AuthorID": "55103012600", "AffiliationID": "60020650", "AffiliationName": "High Performance Research Group, Faculty of Engineering, University of Bristol"}, "7004547192": {"Name": "Ghassemlooy Z.", "AuthorID": "7004547192", "AffiliationID": "60004636", "AffiliationName": "Optical Communications Research Group, NCRLab, Faculty of Engineering and Environment, Northumbria University"}}}
