Indicators for estimating emission savings from resource efficiency projects can play a key role in identifying and prioritising projects. Building on existing emission factor-based approaches, this paper introduces a methodology which allows consistent ex-ante estimation of lifetime carbon savings from corporate resource efficiency investments. This methodology accounts for the intertemporal dimension of resource savings and project lifetimes and allows consistent aggregation across resource and project types. Moreover, it shows how social benefit (or cost) can be monetised. The methodology is tested using a resource efficiency investment project under the UN Clean Development Mechanism. We demonstrate that this indicator can be a robust, coherent and practical tool for firms, governments and investors to estimate carbon emission reductions from resource efficiency investments.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Corporate investments", "Emission factor", "GHG emissions", "Indicator", "Resource efficiency"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85050308690", "SubjectAreas": [["Geography, Planning and Development", "SOCI", "3305"], ["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"56331793000": {"Name": "Rentschler J.", "AuthorID": "56331793000", "AffiliationID": "120988139", "AffiliationName": "Payne Institute for Earth Resources"}, "57192304574": {"Name": "Flachenecker F.", "AuthorID": "57192304574", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Sustainable Resources, University College London"}, "57196413761": {"Name": "Kornejew M.", "AuthorID": "57196413761", "AffiliationID": "60012345", "AffiliationName": "Department of Economics, University of Kiel"}}}
