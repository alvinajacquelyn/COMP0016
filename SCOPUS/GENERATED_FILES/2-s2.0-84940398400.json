MOS sensors have consistently been shown to lack sensitivity to a broad range on analytes, leading to false positive errors. In this study an array of five chromium titanate (CTO) thick-film sensors were produced. These were modified by incorporating a range of zeolites, namely \u03b2, Y, mordenite and ZSM5, into the bulk sensor material. Sensors were exposed to three common reducing gases, namely acetone, ethanol and toluene, and a machine learning technique was applied to differentiate between the different gases. All sensors produced strong resistive responses (increases in resistance) and a support vector machine (SVM) was able to classify the data to a high degree of selectivity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CTO", "gas sensing", "MOS", "SVM", "zeolite"], "IndexKeywords": ["Chromium titanate", "CTO", "Gas sensing", "Machine learning techniques", "MOS", "Sensitive technology", "SVM", "Thick film sensors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84940398400", "SubjectAreas": [["Instrumentation", "PHYS", "3105"], ["Engineering (miscellaneous)", "ENGI", "2201"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"]], "AuthorData": {"56169817000": {"Name": "Pugh D.", "AuthorID": "56169817000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "56217400400": {"Name": "Parkin I.", "AuthorID": "56217400400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "6602657397": {"Name": "Hailes S.", "AuthorID": "6602657397", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
