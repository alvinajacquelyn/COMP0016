On the other hand, many models incorporating Majorana neutrino masses also predict new states and lepton number violating interactions at the TeV scale that can potentially be probed at the LHC. We provide a brief overview of the pertinent operators and a selection of physics models in order to highlight the interplay between neutrinoless double beta decay and LHC searches.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Lepton number", "Majorana neutrino mass", "Neutrino mass", "Neutrinoless double-beta decays", "Physics models"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84957797858", "SubjectAreas": [["Physics and Astronomy (all)", "PHYS", "3100"]], "AuthorData": {"8903178300": {"Name": "Deppisch F.", "AuthorID": "8903178300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}}}
