This paper investigates China\u2019s socioeconomic risk from extreme events under climate change over the next few decades with a focus on sub-national heterogeneity. The empirical relationships between socioeconomic damages and their determinants are identified using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, and are used to estimate future damages as well as associated uncertainty bounds given specified climate and development scenarios. Considering projected changes in exposure, we find that the southwest and central regions and Hainan Island of China are likely to have a larger percentage of population at risk, while most of the southwest and central regions could generally have higher economic losses. Finally, the analysis suggests that increasing income can significantly decrease the number of people affected by extremes.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Changing climate", "Development scenarios", "Empirical relationships", "Extreme events", "Hierarchical bayesian", "Hierarchical Bayesian modeling", "Number of peoples", "Uncertainty bounds"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84986265070", "SubjectAreas": [["Global and Planetary Change", "ENVI", "2306"], ["Atmospheric Science", "EART", "1902"]], "AuthorData": {"55438199300": {"Name": "Yuan X.", "AuthorID": "55438199300", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "55272317400": {"Name": "Mi Z.", "AuthorID": "55272317400", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "13005705700": {"Name": "Wei Y.", "AuthorID": "13005705700", "AffiliationID": "60016835", "AffiliationName": "School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology"}, "56065806100": {"Name": "Sun X.", "AuthorID": "56065806100", "AffiliationID": "60030162, 60089339", "AffiliationName": "Columbia Water Center, Earth Institute, Columbia University"}, "7007127326": {"Name": "Lall U.", "AuthorID": "7007127326", "AffiliationID": "60030162", "AffiliationName": "Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, Columbia University"}, "55618145500": {"Name": "He J.", "AuthorID": "55618145500", "AffiliationID": "60031150, 60019499", "AffiliationName": "Key Laboratory of Water Cycle & Related Land Surface Processes, Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences"}}}
