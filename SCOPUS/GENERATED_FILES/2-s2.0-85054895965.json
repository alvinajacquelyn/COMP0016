Some might think that we should embrace such transplants as one more way to assist people to have children. However, in this paper I argue that uterus transplants are not something that we ought to fund, nor something that we should make easy to access. First, I argue that any justification of providing uterus transplants must be based on the value of the experience of gestation, rather than on claims of meeting medical need or promoting normal functioning. Second, I demonstrate that such a justification has limited prospects of success. The value of experiencing gestation is unlikely to be sufficient to justify state funding of uterus transplants and, further, we have reason to refrain from enabling such transplants.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Assisted reproductive technologies", "Fertility treatment", "Pregnancy", "Uterus transplantation"], "IndexKeywords": ["Female", "Financing, Government", "Humans", "Infertility, Female", "Organ Transplantation", "Pregnancy", "Reproductive Techniques, Assisted", "Uterus"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85054895965", "SubjectAreas": [["Health (social science)", "SOCI", "3306"], ["Philosophy", "ARTS", "1211"], ["Health Policy", "MEDI", "2719"]], "AuthorData": {"55581978700": {"Name": "McTernan E.", "AuthorID": "55581978700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Political Science, University College London"}}}
