We investigated the incidence of adverse events and cure rates according to HIV status for patients receiving standard TB therapy in the trial. Methods: Forty-two HIV-positive cases were matched to 220 HIV-negative controls by age, gender, ethnicity, and trial site using coarsened exact matching. Grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs) were summarised by MedDRA System Organ Class. Kaplan-Meier curves for time to first grade 3 or 4 AE were constructed according to HIV status with hazard ratios calculated. Patients were considered cured if they were culture negative 18 months after commencing therapy with \u22652 consecutive negative culture results. Results: Twenty of 42 (47.6%) HIV-positive and 34 of 220 (15.5%) HIV-negative patients experienced \u22651 grade 3 or 4 AE, respectively. The majority of these were hepatobiliary disorders that accounted for 12 of 40 (30.0%) events occurring in 6 of 42 (14.3%) HIV-positive patients and for 15 of 60 (25.0%) events occurring in 9 of 220 (4.1%) HIV-negative patients. The median time to first grade 3 or 4 AE was 54 days (IQR 15.5-59.0) for HIV-positive and 29.5 days (IQR 9.0-119.0) for HIV-negative patients, respectively. The hazard ratio for experiencing a grade 3 or 4 AE among HIV-positive patients was 3.25 (95% CI 1.87-5.66, p < 0.01). Cure rates were similar, with 38 of 42 (90.5%) HIV-positive and 195 of 220 (88.6%) HIV-negative patients (p = 0.73) cured at 18 months. Conclusions: HIV-positive patients receiving standard TB therapy in the REMoxTB study were at greater risk of adverse events during treatment but cure rates were similar when compared to a matched sample of HIV-negative patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Adverse events", "Clinical trials", "HIV", "Tuberculosis"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Antitubercular Agents", "Ethambutol", "Female", "HIV Seropositivity", "Humans", "Incidence", "Isoniazid", "Linear Models", "Male", "Multivariate Analysis", "Prospective Studies", "Pyrazinamide", "Rifampin", "Risk Factors", "Treatment Outcome", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary", "United Kingdom"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85071044376", "SubjectAreas": [["Pulmonary and Respiratory Medicine", "MEDI", "2740"]], "AuthorData": {"57190394071": {"Name": "Tweed C.D.", "AuthorID": "57190394071", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "36865037400": {"Name": "Crook A.M.", "AuthorID": "36865037400", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7005398416": {"Name": "Meredith S.K.", "AuthorID": "7005398416", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "7102771386": {"Name": "Nunn A.J.", "AuthorID": "7102771386", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60003108", "AffiliationName": "MRC Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "24471532800": {"Name": "Dawson R.", "AuthorID": "24471532800", "AffiliationID": "60079962", "AffiliationName": "University of Cape Town Lung Institute"}, "7004254865": {"Name": "Diacon A.H.", "AuthorID": "7004254865", "AffiliationID": "60113675", "AffiliationName": "TASK Applied Science"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "McHugh T.D.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "50061699000": {"Name": "Murphy M.E.", "AuthorID": "50061699000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "56744462100": {"Name": "Mendel C.M.", "AuthorID": "56744462100", "AffiliationID": "105498255", "AffiliationName": "TB Alliance"}, "16944720400": {"Name": "Spigelman M.", "AuthorID": "16944720400", "AffiliationID": "105498255", "AffiliationName": "TB Alliance"}, "24734526800": {"Name": "Mohapi L.", "AuthorID": "24734526800", "AffiliationID": "100439700", "AffiliationName": "Perinatal HIV Research Unit"}, "57203608245": {"Name": "Phillips P.P.J.", "AuthorID": "57203608245", "AffiliationID": "60085748", "AffiliationName": "Division of Pulmonology, University of San Francisco"}, "55574201314": {"Name": "Singh K.P.", "AuthorID": "55574201314", "AffiliationID": "60026553, 60117340, 60005245", "AffiliationName": "Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital"}, "7101706332": {"Name": "Gillespie S.H.", "AuthorID": "7101706332", "AffiliationID": "60009979", "AffiliationName": "University of St Andrews Medical School"}}}
