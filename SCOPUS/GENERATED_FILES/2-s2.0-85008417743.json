This was done in order to assess their charge photogeneration and recombination characteristics in blends with PC71BM. Two charge photogeneration mechanisms are found to be operating, depending on which component of the blend is photoexcited. Despite virtually isoenergetic LUMO levels, photoexcitation of the polymer causes standard electron transfer, albeit with a relatively low efficiency of 17 %. Photoexcitation of the fullerene, however, produces an exceptionally slow nanosecond timescale hole transfer.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Charge photogeneration", "Conjugated polymers", "Low band gap", "Organic solar cells", "Transient absorption spectroscopy"], "IndexKeywords": ["Charge photogeneration", "Low band gap", "Low bandgap polymers", "Narrow band gap polymers", "Naturally occurring", "Organic electronics", "Thin film crystallinity", "Transient absorption spectroscopies"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85008417743", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"56779792400": {"Name": "Fallon K.", "AuthorID": "56779792400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24477074800": {"Name": "Bronstein H.", "AuthorID": "24477074800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "7202914994": {"Name": "Clarke T.", "AuthorID": "7202914994", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Chemistry, University College London"}, "24821388000": {"Name": "Dimitrov S.", "AuthorID": "24821388000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}, "56401622800": {"Name": "Durrant J.", "AuthorID": "56401622800", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Plastic Electronics, Imperial College London"}}}
