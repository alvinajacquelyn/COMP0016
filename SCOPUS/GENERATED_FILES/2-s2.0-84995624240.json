AFM offers significant advantages over scanning electron microscopy (SEM) including the acquisition of quantitative 3D-images and biomechanical information. More importantly, for in-vivo biological imaging, AFM does not require sample dehydration/labeling. We show for the first time high-resolution topographical images of the cuticle of the model organism C. elegans under physiological conditions using AFM. C. elegans is used extensively for drug screening and to study pathogen adherence in innate immunity; both applications highly depend on the integrity of the nematode's cuticle. Mutations affecting both drug adsorption and pathogen clearance have been proposed to relate to changes in the cuticle structure, but never visually examined in high resolution. In this study we use AFM to visualize the topography of wild-type adult C. elegans as well as several cuticle collagen mutants and describe previously unseen anatomical differences.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atomic force microscopy", "C. elegans", "Collagens", "Cuticle mutants", "Nano-scale topography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Caenorhabditis elegans", "Cuticle mutants", "Elegans", "Nano scale", "Nanometer resolutions", "Physiological condition", "Topographic imaging", "Topographical images", "Animals", "Caenorhabditis elegans", "Collagen", "Imaging, Three-Dimensional", "Microscopy, Atomic Force"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84995624240", "SubjectAreas": [["Bioengineering", "CENG", "1502"], ["Medicine (miscellaneous)", "MEDI", "2701"], ["Molecular Medicine", "BIOC", "1313"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"], ["Materials Science (all)", "MATE", "2500"], ["Pharmaceutical Science", "PHAR", "3003"]], "AuthorData": {"57191975066": {"Name": "Essmann C.", "AuthorID": "57191975066", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL TouchLab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "6506149530": {"Name": "Elmi M.", "AuthorID": "6506149530", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL TouchLab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "57169472300": {"Name": "Shaw M.", "AuthorID": "57169472300", "AffiliationID": "60010785", "AffiliationName": "Analytical Science Division, National Physical Laboratory"}, "57191972869": {"Name": "Anand G.", "AuthorID": "57191972869", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "13607280000": {"Name": "Pawar V.", "AuthorID": "13607280000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL TouchLab, Department of Computer Science, University College London"}, "7203044605": {"Name": "Srinivasan M.", "AuthorID": "7203044605", "AffiliationID": "60022195", "AffiliationName": "MIT Touchlab, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Research Laboratory of Electronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}}
