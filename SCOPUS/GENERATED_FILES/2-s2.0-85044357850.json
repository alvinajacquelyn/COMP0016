It illustrates how the exploitation\u2013exploration dilemma is dissolved by acting to minimise uncertainty (i.e. expected surprise or free energy). We use simulations of a maze problem to illustrate how agents can solve quite complicated problems using context sensitive prior preferences to form subgoals. Our focus is on how epistemic behaviour\u2014driven by novelty and the imperative to reduce uncertainty about the world\u2014contextualises pragmatic or goal-directed behaviour. Using simulations, we illustrate the underlying process theory with synthetic behavioural and electrophysiological responses during exploration of a maze and subsequent navigation to a target location. An interesting phenomenon that emerged from the simulations was a putative distinction between \u2018place cells\u2019\u2014that fire when a subgoal is reached\u2014and \u2018path cells\u2019\u2014that fire until a subgoal is reached.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Active inference", "Bayesian", "Curiosity", "Epistemic value", "Exploitation", "Exploration", "Free energy", "Novelty", "Salience"], "IndexKeywords": ["Active inference", "Bayesian", "Curiosity", "Epistemic value", "Exploitation", "Novelty", "Salience", "Animals", "Bayes Theorem", "Brain", "Computer Simulation", "Goals", "Humans", "Maze Learning", "Models, Biological", "Motivation", "Neurons", "Spatial Navigation"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044357850", "SubjectAreas": [["Biotechnology", "BIOC", "1305"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"36967601300": {"Name": "Kaplan R.", "AuthorID": "36967601300", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London (UCL)"}, "36080215500": {"Name": "Friston K.", "AuthorID": "36080215500", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60084279, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of Neurology, University College London (UCL)"}}}
