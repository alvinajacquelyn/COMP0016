Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License.We analyze transducer-matched multipulse excitation as a method for improving of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for diode laser-based photoacoustic systems. We discuss the principle of the technique, its advantages, and potential drawbacks and perform measurements to analyze the obtainable SNR increase. We show in experiment and computationally that a lower boundary estimate of 1.2 to 1.8 fold SNR improvement can be provided using transducer-matched pulse bursts, depending on the transducer and particular arrangement. Finally, we analyze implications that the transducer resonance effects may have on the recently introduced advanced photoacoustic techniques. The findings are of immediate interest to modalities utilizing dense pulse sequences and systems possessing limited pulse energy. In particular, transducer-matched multipulse excitation may be beneficial for diode-based photoacoustic systems operated with transducers in the range of 1 to 5 MHz since the required hardware is readily available.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Diode lasers", "Photoacoustic imaging", "Resonance", "Signal-to-noise ratio", "Ultrasound transducers"], "IndexKeywords": ["Photo-acoustic imaging", "Photoacoustic systems", "Photoacoustic techniques", "Pulse energies", "SNR improvement", "Systems possessing", "Transducer resonance", "Ultrasound transducers", "Equipment Design", "Lasers, Semiconductor", "Optical Imaging", "Photoacoustic Techniques", "Signal-To-Noise Ratio", "Transducers"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064722543", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Biomaterials", "MATE", "2502"], ["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"], ["Biomedical Engineering", "ENGI", "2204"]], "AuthorData": {"56785637100": {"Name": "Cherkashin M.N.", "AuthorID": "56785637100", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Ruhr University Bochum, Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology"}, "56211779700": {"Name": "Brenner C.", "AuthorID": "56211779700", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Ruhr University Bochum, Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology"}, "7403255343": {"Name": "Hofmann M.R.", "AuthorID": "7403255343", "AffiliationID": "60005322", "AffiliationName": "Ruhr University Bochum, Photonics and Terahertz Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology"}}}
