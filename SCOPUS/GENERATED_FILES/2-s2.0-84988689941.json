While previous theoretical and empirical work has often been preoccupied with individual performance-related pay, we find that the receipt of a range of group-performance schemes (profit shares, group bonuses and share ownership) is associated with higher job satisfaction. This holds conditional on wage levels, so that pay methods are associated with greater job satisfaction in addition to that coming from higher wages. We use a variety of methods to control for unobserved individual and job-specific characteristics. We suggest that half of the share-capitalism effect is accounted for by employees reciprocating for the \u201cgift\u201d we also show that share capitalism helps dampen the negative wellbeing effects of what we typically think of as \u201cbad\u201d aspects of job quality.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Compensation methods", "Job satisfaction", "Wages", "Working conditions"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988689941", "SubjectAreas": [["Economics and Econometrics", "ECON", "2002"], ["Organizational Behavior and Human Resource Management", "BUSI", "1407"]], "AuthorData": {"7005546003": {"Name": "Bryson A.", "AuthorID": "7005546003", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL, NIESR, IZA"}, "57214108640": {"Name": "Clark A.", "AuthorID": "57214108640", "AffiliationID": "60008134, 60108957", "AffiliationName": "Paris School of Economics, CNRS and IZA"}, "55331486100": {"Name": "Freeman R.", "AuthorID": "55331486100", "AffiliationID": "60020337", "AffiliationName": "Harvard, NBER, CEP"}, "7402358029": {"Name": "Green C.", "AuthorID": "7402358029", "AffiliationID": "60023643", "AffiliationName": "Lancaster University"}}}
