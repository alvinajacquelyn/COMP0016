Acquired resistance to PI3K-mTOR inhibition is a major hurdle to overcome in the success of PI3K-mTOR targeted agents. H460, A549, and H1975 resistant cells were generated by prolonged treatment in culture with Apitolisib (GDC-0980), a dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor over a period of several months, from age-matched parent cells. Resistance was deemed to have developed when a log fold difference in IC50 had been achieved. Resistant cell lines also exhibited resistance to another widely investigated PI3K-mTOR dual inhibitor; Dactolisib (BEZ235). Cell lines were characterised at the level of mRNA (expression array profiling expression of >150 genes), miRNA (expression array profiling of 2100 miRNAs), protein (bottoms-up label-free mass spectrometry) and phosphoprotein (expression array profiling of 84 phospho/total proteins). Key alterations were validated by qPCR and Western blot. H1975 cells were initially most sensitive to Apitolisib (GDC-0980), but developed resistance more quickly than the other cell lines, perhaps due to increased selective pressure from the impressive initial effect. In-depth molecular profiling suggested epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may play a role in resistance to PI3K-mTOR dual inhibition in NSCLC.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antineoplastic Agents", "Blotting, Western", "Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Cell Line, Tumor", "Drug Resistance", "Gene Expression Profiling", "Humans", "Imidazoles", "Inhibitory Concentration 50", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase", "Proteome", "Pyrimidines", "Quinolines", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85041139245", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55856382500": {"Name": "Heavey S.", "AuthorID": "55856382500", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Thoracic Oncology Research Group, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}, "57190287884": {"Name": "Moore G.", "AuthorID": "57190287884", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Thoracic Oncology Research Group, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}, "8277210200": {"Name": "Barr M.P.", "AuthorID": "8277210200", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Thoracic Oncology Research Group, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}, "57200398054": {"Name": "Kelly N.", "AuthorID": "57200398054", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Thoracic Oncology Research Group, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}, "26221722800": {"Name": "Cuffe S.", "AuthorID": "26221722800", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Thoracic Oncology Research Group, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}, "57194377042": {"Name": "Finn S.P.", "AuthorID": "57194377042", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Thoracic Oncology Research Group, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}, "23090559800": {"Name": "Gately K.", "AuthorID": "23090559800", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Thoracic Oncology Research Group, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}, "7101912158": {"Name": "Dowling P.", "AuthorID": "7101912158", "AffiliationID": "60026281", "AffiliationName": "Biology, NUI Maynooth"}, "24477842200": {"Name": "Maher S.G.", "AuthorID": "24477842200", "AffiliationID": "60011149", "AffiliationName": "Department of Surgery, Trinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin"}, "35079153500": {"Name": "O'Byrne K.J.", "AuthorID": "35079153500", "AffiliationID": "60011019", "AffiliationName": "Cancer and Ageing Research Program, QUT"}}}
