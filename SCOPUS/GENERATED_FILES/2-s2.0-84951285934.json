A number of recent studies have also shown that the temperature history of the device after the irradiation impacts the performance of the detector, linked to the mobility of defects at different temperatures. This study describes the initial results from an e2v technologies p-channel CCD204 irradiated at 153 K with a 10 MeV equivalent proton fluences of 1.24\u00d7109 and 1.24\u00d71011 protons.cm-2. The number of defects identified using trap pumping, dark current and cosmetic quality immediately after irradiation and over a period of 150 hours after the irradiation with the device held at 153 K and then after different periods of time at room temperature are described. The device also exhibited a flatband voltage shift of around 30 mV per krad, determined by the reduction in full well capacity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["CCD", "cryogenic irradiation", "p-channel", "proton radiation damage"], "IndexKeywords": ["Displacement damages", "E2v technologies", "Flat-band voltage shift", "Full well capacity", "P channels", "Proton radiation damage", "Radiation-induced", "Temperature history"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84951285934", "SubjectAreas": [["Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials", "MATE", "2504"], ["Condensed Matter Physics", "PHYS", "3104"], ["Computer Science Applications", "COMP", "1706"], ["Applied Mathematics", "MATH", "2604"], ["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"22984865200": {"Name": "Gow J.", "AuthorID": "22984865200", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University, DPS"}, "57198667804": {"Name": "Wood D.", "AuthorID": "57198667804", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University, DPS"}, "57214169439": {"Name": "Hall D.", "AuthorID": "57214169439", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University, DPS"}, "36454630800": {"Name": "Dryer B.", "AuthorID": "36454630800", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University, DPS"}, "7202996580": {"Name": "Holland A.", "AuthorID": "7202996580", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University, DPS"}, "24073235100": {"Name": "Murray N.", "AuthorID": "24073235100", "AffiliationID": "60012113", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Electronic Imaging, Open University, DPS"}, "7102130581": {"Name": "Burt D.", "AuthorID": "7102130581", "AffiliationID": "60102138", "AffiliationName": "E2v Technologies plc"}}}
