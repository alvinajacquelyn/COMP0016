This is a retrospective IRB-approved analysis of 211 patients at 25 institutions who underwent salvage procedure or device explant between 2001 and 2016. Patient data were compiled after an extensive review of all aspects of their electronic medical records. Climate data were compiled from monthly norms based on location, as well as specific data regarding temperature, dew point, and humidity from dates of surgery. Rigorous statistical analysis was performed. We found that penile prosthesis infections occurred more commonly in June (n = 24) and less frequently during the winter months (n = 39), with the lowest number occurring in March (n = 11). One-hundred thirty-nine infections occurred at average daily temperatures greater than 55 \u00b0F, compared to 72 infections at less than 55 \u00b0F. The incidence rate ratio for this trend was 1.93, with a p-value of <0.001. Humidity results were similar, and fungal infections correlate with daily humidity. Infected implants performed in the fall and summer were over 3 and 2.3 times, respectively, more likely to grow Gram-positive bacteria compared to implants performed in spring (p = 0.004; p = 0.039). This was consistent across geographic location, including in the Southern hemisphere. We found trends between climate factors and IPP infection like those seen and proven in other surgical literature. To our knowledge these data represent the first exploration of the relationship between temperature and infection in prosthetic urology.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-85065255586", "SubjectAreas": [["Urology", "MEDI", "2748"]], "AuthorData": {"57109724700": {"Name": "Gross M.S.", "AuthorID": "57109724700", "AffiliationID": "60001844", "AffiliationName": "Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center"}, "57195343810": {"Name": "Vollstedt A.J.", "AuthorID": "57195343810", "AffiliationID": "60001844", "AffiliationName": "Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center"}, "7004469245": {"Name": "Cleves M.A.", "AuthorID": "7004469245", "AffiliationID": "60024885", "AffiliationName": "University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences"}, "7003373533": {"Name": "Glina S.", "AuthorID": "7003373533", "AffiliationID": "60063718", "AffiliationName": "Faculdade de Medicina do ABC/Instituto H.Ellis"}, "7003578095": {"Name": "Honig S.C.", "AuthorID": "7003578095", "AffiliationID": "60017994", "AffiliationName": "Yale School of Medicine"}, "6506347566": {"Name": "Perito P.", "AuthorID": "6506347566", "AffiliationID": "114485110", "AffiliationName": "Perito Urology"}, "7103098874": {"Name": "Stahl P.J.", "AuthorID": "7103098874", "AffiliationID": "60011605", "AffiliationName": "Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons"}, "57195736121": {"Name": "Gay\u00e1 M.R.", "AuthorID": "57195736121", "AffiliationID": "60024524", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Quir\u00f3n Palmaplanas Salud"}, "7004649795": {"Name": "Gheiler E.", "AuthorID": "7004649795", "AffiliationID": "114705491", "AffiliationName": "Urology Specialists"}, "55781298300": {"Name": "Ralph D.J.", "AuthorID": "55781298300", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "University College London Hospital"}, "12142500300": {"Name": "K\u00f6hler T.", "AuthorID": "12142500300", "AffiliationID": "60005558", "AffiliationName": "Mayo Clinic"}, "6506851581": {"Name": "Stember D.S.", "AuthorID": "6506851581", "AffiliationID": "60004670", "AffiliationName": "Mount Sinai Hospital"}, "35516227100": {"Name": "Carrion R.", "AuthorID": "35516227100", "AffiliationID": "60011951", "AffiliationName": "USF Morsani College of Medicine"}, "55980055800": {"Name": "Maria P.", "AuthorID": "55980055800", "AffiliationID": "60002388", "AffiliationName": "Albert Einstein College of Medicine"}, "6701657305": {"Name": "Brant W.O.", "AuthorID": "6701657305", "AffiliationID": "60026895", "AffiliationName": "Intermountain Healthcare"}, "36932778900": {"Name": "Garber B.", "AuthorID": "36932778900", "AffiliationID": "60018435", "AffiliationName": "Hahnemann University Hospital"}, "35476778900": {"Name": "Burnett A.L.", "AuthorID": "35476778900", "AffiliationID": "60001117", "AffiliationName": "Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine"}, "7005493432": {"Name": "Eid J.F.", "AuthorID": "7005493432", "AffiliationID": "112856839", "AffiliationName": "Advanced Urological Care"}, "7202191323": {"Name": "Henry G.D.", "AuthorID": "7202191323", "AffiliationID": "119902335", "AffiliationName": "Ark-La-Tex Urology"}, "7003976941": {"Name": "Munarriz R.", "AuthorID": "7003976941", "AffiliationID": "60122766", "AffiliationName": "Boston University Medical Center"}}}
