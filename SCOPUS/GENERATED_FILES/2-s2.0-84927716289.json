For decarbonisation of the petrochemical industry, integrated catalytic processing of biomass pyrolysis oil (also known as bio-oil) is an enabling technology. This is because, under certain conditions, the reaction products form a mixture consisting of olefins and aromatics, which are very similar to the products of naphtha hydro-cracking in the conventional olefin processes. These synergies suggest that the catalytic bio-oil upgrading reactors can be seamlessly integrated to the subsequent separation network with minimal retrofitting costs. In addition, the integrated catalytic processing provides a high degree of flexibility for optimization of different products in response to market fluctuations. With the aim of assessing the techno-economic viability of this pathway, five scenarios in which different fractions of bio-oil (water soluble/water insoluble) were processed with different degrees of hydrogenation were studied in the present research. The results showed that such a retrofit is not only economically viable, but also provides a high degree of flexibility to the process, and contributes to decarbonisation of olefin infrastructures. Up to 44% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were observed in several scenarios. In addition, it was shown that hydrogen prices lower than 6. $/kg will result in bio-based chemicals which are cheaper than equivalent petrochemicals. Alternatively, for higher hydrogen prices, it is possible to reform the water insoluble phase of bio-oil and produce bio-based chemicals, cheaper than petrochemical equivalents.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Biomass pyrolysis oil", "Decarbonisation", "Life cycle assessment", "Olefins", "Techno-economics"], "IndexKeywords": ["Biomass pyrolysis oil", "Decarbonisation", "Degree of flexibility", "Enabling technologies", "Integrated catalytic processing", "Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)", "Petrochemical industry", "Techno-economics"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927716289", "SubjectAreas": [["Building and Construction", "ENGI", "2215"], ["Energy (all)", "ENER", "2100"], ["Mechanical Engineering", "ENGI", "2210"], ["Management, Monitoring, Policy and Law", "ENVI", "2308"]], "AuthorData": {"8369664900": {"Name": "Sharifzadeh M.", "AuthorID": "8369664900", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering (CPSE), Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "56846290400": {"Name": "Shah N.", "AuthorID": "56846290400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Process Systems Engineering (CPSE), Department of Chemical Engineering, Imperial College London"}, "57070568200": {"Name": "Wang L.", "AuthorID": "57070568200", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Environmental Policy, Imperial College London"}}}
