Advances in sodium imaging offer the unique chance to access signal changes directly linked to sodium ions (23Na) flux across the cell membrane, which generates action potentials, hence signal transmission in the brain. During this process 23Na transiently accumulates in the intracellular space. Here we show that quantitative functional sodium imaging (fNaI) at 3T is potentially sensitive to 23Na concentration changes during finger tapping, which can be quantified in gray and white matter regions key to motor function. For the first time, we measured a 23Na concentration change of 0.54 mmol/l in the ipsilateral cerebellum, 0.46 mmol/l in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1), 0.27 mmol/l in the corpus callosum and -11 mmol/l in the ipsilateral M1, suggesting that fNaI is sensitive to distributed functional alterations. Open issues persist on the role of the glymphatic system in maintaining 23Na homeostasis, the role of excitation and inhibition as well as volume distributions during neuronal activity. Haemodynamic and physiological signal recordings coupled to realistic models of tissue function will be critical to understand the mechanisms of such changes and contribute to meeting the overarching challenge of measuring neuronal activity in vivo.", "AuthorKeywords": ["BOLD", "Functional imaging", "MRI", "Neuronal activity", "Sodium imaging"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85057187257", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"6602501665": {"Name": "Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott C.A.M.", "AuthorID": "6602501665", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Brain MRI 3T Mondino Research Center, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "55614953600": {"Name": "Riemer F.", "AuthorID": "55614953600", "AffiliationID": "60025649, 60031101", "AffiliationName": "Department of Radiology, School of Clinical Medicine, University of Cambridge"}, "57204783594": {"Name": "Ricciardi A.", "AuthorID": "57204783594", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Center for Medical Image Computing, Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, University College London"}, "55257860400": {"Name": "Castellazzi G.", "AuthorID": "55257860400", "AffiliationID": "60015197", "AffiliationName": "Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia"}, "57193550334": {"Name": "Prados F.", "AuthorID": "57193550334", "AffiliationID": "60002581", "AffiliationName": "Universitat Oberta de Catalunya"}, "57193024760": {"Name": "Solanky B.", "AuthorID": "57193024760", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}, "57192307491": {"Name": "D\u2019Angelo E.U.", "AuthorID": "57192307491", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Brain Connectivity Center, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "37038201700": {"Name": "Palesi F.", "AuthorID": "37038201700", "AffiliationID": "60083543", "AffiliationName": "Neuroradiology Unit, IRCCS Mondino Foundation"}, "7004309393": {"Name": "Golay X.", "AuthorID": "7004309393", "AffiliationID": "60019953, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "NMR Research Unit, Queen Square MS Centre, Department of Brain Repair and Rehabilitation, UCL Institute of Neurology, Faculty of Brain Sciences, University College London"}}}
