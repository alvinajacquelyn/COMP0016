The wetland region (Haor) of northeastern (NE) Bangladesh was severely affected by flash floods early in 2017, affecting nearly 1 million households and damaging US $450 million worth of rice crops. This study investigates how the NE Bangladesh experienced the 2017 flash floods, and to what degree the wetland communities are vulnerable and resilience to flash floods. Focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and household questionnaire surveys (n = 80) were applied in the study area of Sunamganj district. Results from statistical analyses and regression modelling reveal that poor people are particularly vulnerable to floods but they are also more adaptive and thus resilient; middle-income households are vulnerable as they are hesitant to take up any jobs and accept flood relief; and rich households, despite being less adaptive, are able to recover from flood disasters because of wealth. This study reveals that resilience also stems from deep religious faith in the Haor inhabitants that supports communities to move on by accepting that most natural calamities such as flash floods are divine tests. This study also finds that women are particularly vulnerable and less resilient as they are not normally allowed to work outside of their homes and beyond the Haor communities due to cultural and religious reasons.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Bangladesh", "Flash flooding", "Haor region", "Livelihoods", "Resilience", "Vulnerability"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85049092860", "SubjectAreas": [["Geotechnical Engineering and Engineering Geology", "EART", "1909"], ["Safety Research", "SOCI", "3311"], ["Geology", "EART", "1907"]], "AuthorData": {"57198319949": {"Name": "Kamal A.S.M.M.", "AuthorID": "57198319949", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disaster Science and Management, University of Dhaka"}, "57201095013": {"Name": "Hassan S.M.K.", "AuthorID": "57201095013", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disaster Science and Management, University of Dhaka"}, "57214494238": {"Name": "Islam M.S.", "AuthorID": "57214494238", "AffiliationID": "60014714", "AffiliationName": "Department of Disaster Science and Management, University of Dhaka"}, "22956412500": {"Name": "Shamsudduha M.", "AuthorID": "22956412500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "55919919600": {"Name": "Ahmed B.", "AuthorID": "55919919600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}, "23390064600": {"Name": "Kelman I.", "AuthorID": "23390064600", "AffiliationID": "60080184", "AffiliationName": "University of Agder"}, "53263569800": {"Name": "Fordham M.", "AuthorID": "53263569800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Risk and Disaster Reduction, University College London"}}}
