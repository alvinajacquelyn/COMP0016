We aimed to study the relationship between generic QOL and laboratory measurements and lifestyle factors in community dwelling older Chinese people.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis. Six hundred and ninety nine elders were randomly selected from the examinees of the annual health examination in Taipei City, Taiwan. Blood, urine and stool of the participants were examined and lifestyle data were collected. Participants completed the CASP-19 (control, autonomy, self-realization, pleasure) questionnaire, a 19-item QOL scale. The relationship between QOL and laboratory results and lifestyle factors was explored, using multiple linear regression and profile analysis.Results: The mean age of the participants was 75.5 years (SD = 6.5), and 49.5% were female. Male gender standardized \u03b2 coefficients (\u03b2 = 0.122) and exercise habit (\u03b2 = 0.170) were associated with a better QOL, whereas advanced age (\u03b2 =-0.242), blurred vision (\u03b2 =-0.143), depression (\u03b2 =-0.125), central obesity (\u03b2 =-0.093), anemia (\u03b2 =-0.095), rheumatoid arthritis (\u03b2 =-0.073), Parkinsonism (\u03b2 =-0.079), malignancy (\u03b2 =-0.086) and motorcycle riding (\u03b2 =-0.086) were associated with a lower QOL. Profile analysis revealed that young-old males, social drinkers, regular exercisers and car drivers had the best QOL (all p < 0.001).Conclusion: Of the many laboratory measurements, only anemia was associated with the lower QOL. By contrast, several lifestyle factors, such as social drinking, exercise habit and car driving, were associated with better QOL, whereas abdominal obesity and motorcycle riding were associated with lower QOL.", "AuthorKeywords": ["clinical status", "lifestyle factors", "old age", "quality of life"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Aging", "Body Mass Index", "Cross-Sectional Studies", "Factor Analysis, Statistical", "Female", "Geriatric Assessment", "Health Status Indicators", "Humans", "Independent Living", "Life Style", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Quality of Life", "Questionnaires", "Socioeconomic Factors", "Taiwan"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84924538768", "SubjectAreas": [["Psychiatric Mental Health", "NURS", "2921"], ["Gerontology", "NURS", "2909"], ["Geriatrics and Gerontology", "MEDI", "2717"], ["Psychiatry and Mental Health", "MEDI", "2738"]], "AuthorData": {"14828456000": {"Name": "Wu T.", "AuthorID": "14828456000", "AffiliationID": "60027502", "AffiliationName": "Department of Family Medicine, Renai Branch, Taipei City Hospital"}, "55194543700": {"Name": "Chie W.", "AuthorID": "55194543700", "AffiliationID": "60005429", "AffiliationName": "Department of Public Health, College of Public Health, National Taiwan University"}, "7410119628": {"Name": "Liu J.", "AuthorID": "7410119628", "AffiliationID": "60010037", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biometrics and Bioinformatics, Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes"}, "14828218300": {"Name": "Liaw C.", "AuthorID": "14828218300", "AffiliationID": "60029140", "AffiliationName": "Department of Healthcare Information and Management, Ming Chuan University"}, "9233259300": {"Name": "Netuveli G.", "AuthorID": "9233259300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60006924", "AffiliationName": "International Centre for Life Course Studies in Society and Health, University College London"}, "57195814716": {"Name": "Blane D.", "AuthorID": "57195814716", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University College London"}}}
