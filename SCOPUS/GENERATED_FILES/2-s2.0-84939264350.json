Endotoxaemia contributes to innate immune system activation and the detoxifying function of albumin, critical to recovery from liver injury, is irreversibly destroyed in acute liver failure. University College London-Liver Dialysis Device is a novel artificial extracorporeal liver assist device, which is used with albumin infusion, to achieve removal and replacement of dysfunctional albumin and reduction in endotoxaemia. We aimed to test the effect of this device on survival in a pig model of acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure. Methods Pigs were randomised to three groups: Acetaminophen plus University College London-Liver Dialysis Device (n = 9); Acetaminophen plus Control Device (n = 7); and Control plus Control Device (n = 4). Device treatment was initiated two h after onset of irreversible acute liver failure. Results The Liver Dialysis Device resulted in 67% reduced risk of death in acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure compared to Control Device (hazard ratio = 0.33, p = 0.0439). This was associated with 27% decrease in circulating irreversibly oxidised human non-mercaptalbumin-2 throughout treatment (p = 0.046); 54% reduction in overall severity of endotoxaemia (p = 0.024); delay in development of vasoplegia and acute lung injury; and delay in systemic activation of the TLR4 signalling pathway. Liver Dialysis Device-associated adverse clinical effects were not seen. Conclusions The survival benefit and lack of adverse effects would support clinical trials of University College London-Liver Dialysis Device in acute liver failure patients.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Acetaminophen", "Acute liver failure", "Albumin", "Endotoxin", "Extracorporeal liver assist device", "Toll-like receptor 4", "UCL-LDD"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Endotoxins", "Extracorporeal Circulation", "Female", "HMGB1 Protein", "Liver Failure, Acute", "Liver, Artificial", "Serum Albumin", "Signal Transduction", "Sorption Detoxification", "Swine", "Toll-Like Receptor 4"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939264350", "SubjectAreas": [["Hepatology", "MEDI", "2721"]], "AuthorData": {"55949753800": {"Name": "Lee K.C.L.", "AuthorID": "55949753800", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "55989373000": {"Name": "Baker L.A.", "AuthorID": "55989373000", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "47761541500": {"Name": "Stanzani G.", "AuthorID": "47761541500", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6602505771": {"Name": "Alibhai H.", "AuthorID": "6602505771", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "7501841562": {"Name": "Chang Y.M.", "AuthorID": "7501841562", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "56712904700": {"Name": "Jimenez Palacios C.", "AuthorID": "56712904700", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "56712394500": {"Name": "Giordano P.", "AuthorID": "56712394500", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College"}, "6508041786": {"Name": "Priestnall S.L.", "AuthorID": "6508041786", "AffiliationID": "60026530", "AffiliationName": "Department of Pathology and Pathogen Biology, Royal Veterinary College"}, "54901322700": {"Name": "Leckie P.J.", "AuthorID": "54901322700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College, Royal Free Campus"}, "7003637169": {"Name": "Andreola F.", "AuthorID": "7003637169", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College, Royal Free Campus"}, "6603672216": {"Name": "Mookerjee R.P.", "AuthorID": "6603672216", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College, Royal Free Campus"}, "7202610468": {"Name": "Davies N.A.", "AuthorID": "7202610468", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College, Royal Free Campus"}, "7005505892": {"Name": "Jalan R.", "AuthorID": "7005505892", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Liver Failure Group, University College, Royal Free Campus"}, "24390766700": {"Name": "Antoine D.J.", "AuthorID": "24390766700", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "7402398972": {"Name": "Jenkins R.E.", "AuthorID": "7402398972", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "6602296367": {"Name": "Goldring C.E.", "AuthorID": "6602296367", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "35478124100": {"Name": "Park B.K.", "AuthorID": "35478124100", "AffiliationID": "60020661", "AffiliationName": "MRC Centre for Drug Safety Science, Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, University of Liverpool"}, "15749911500": {"Name": "Agarwal B.", "AuthorID": "15749911500", "AffiliationID": "60170516", "AffiliationName": "Intensive Care Unit, Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
