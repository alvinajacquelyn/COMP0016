In this work, we study the fault-tolerant performance of a topological cluster state scheme with local nondeterministic entanglement generation, where failed entangling gates (which correspond to bonds on the lattice representation of the cluster state) lead to a defective three-dimensional lattice with missing bonds. We present two approaches for dealing with missing bonds; the first is a nonadaptive scheme that requires no additional quantum processing, and the second is an adaptive scheme in which qubits can be measured in an alternative basis to effectively remove them from the lattice, hence eliminating their damaging effect and leading to better threshold performance. We find that a fault-tolerance threshold can still be observed with a bond-loss rate of 6.5% for the nonadaptive scheme, and a bond-loss rate as high as 14.5% for the adaptive scheme.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adaptive scheme", "Damaging effects", "Entanglement generation", "Fault-tolerant quantum computation", "Lattice representation", "Physical qubits", "Three-dimensional lattices", "Threshold performance"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044129389", "SubjectAreas": [["Atomic and Molecular Physics, and Optics", "PHYS", "3107"]], "AuthorData": {"57213872741": {"Name": "Auger J.M.", "AuthorID": "57213872741", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "55257815000": {"Name": "Anwar H.", "AuthorID": "55257815000", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics, Imperial College London"}, "7102407945": {"Name": "Browne D.E.", "AuthorID": "7102407945", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London"}, "24484421400": {"Name": "Gimeno-Segovia M.", "AuthorID": "24484421400", "AffiliationID": "60002306", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Quantum Science and Technology, University of Calgary"}, "6603598567": {"Name": "Stace T.M.", "AuthorID": "6603598567", "AffiliationID": "60031004, 60160423", "AffiliationName": "ARC, Centre for Engineered Quantum Systems, University of Queensland"}}}
