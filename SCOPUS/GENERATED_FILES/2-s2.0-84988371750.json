The idea that value is only connected to original material or specific perceptions of condition has been challenged repeatedly by the very makers and primary users of these collections. Nevertheless, old expectations in relation to collections may still affect conservation processes. The conservator is positioned at the center of these tensions, trying to understand, negotiate and mediate the interests and values of dynamic layers of significance associated with the object being treated. Attempting to homogenize or generalize these relationships would directly affect the complexity of the meanings of the artworks and run the risk of hollowing them.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Deterioration", "Intent", "Interpretation", "Longevity", "Meaning", "Replicas", "Significance", "Values"], "IndexKeywords": ["Intent", "Interpretation", "Longevity", "Meaning", "Replicas", "Significance", "Values"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84988371750", "SubjectAreas": [["Conservation", "ARTS", "1206"]], "AuthorData": {"15521429200": {"Name": "Peters R.", "AuthorID": "15521429200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Archaeology, University College"}}}
