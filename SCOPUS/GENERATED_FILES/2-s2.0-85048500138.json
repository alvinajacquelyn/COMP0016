This effectiveness has consequences for the design and analysis of trials assessing experimental PrEP regimens, which now generally include an active-control tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine group, rather than a placebo group, as a comparator. Herein, we describe major problems in the interpretation of the primary measure of effectiveness proposed for these trials, namely the ratio of HIV incidence in the experimental agent group to that in the active-control group. We argue that valid interpretation requires an assumption about one of two parameters: either the incidence among trial participants had they not received PrEP or the effectiveness of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate plus emtricitabine within the trial. However, neither parameter is directly observed because of the absence of a no-treatment group, thus requiring the use of external evidence or subjective judgment. We propose an alternative measure of effectiveness based on the concept of averted infections, which incorporates one of these parameters. The measure is simple to interpret, has clinical and public health relevance, and is a natural preservation-of-effect criterion for assessing statistical non-inferiority. Its adoption could also allow the use of smaller sample sizes, currently a major barrier to the assessment of experimental PrEP regimens.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Anti-HIV Agents", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Emtricitabine", "Health Services Accessibility", "HIV Infections", "Humans", "Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis", "Tenofovir", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85048500138", "SubjectAreas": [["Epidemiology", "MEDI", "2713"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"], ["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"], ["Virology", "IMMU", "2406"]], "AuthorData": {"56595739700": {"Name": "Dunn D.", "AuthorID": "56595739700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "23482010600": {"Name": "McCormack S.", "AuthorID": "23482010600", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60015879", "AffiliationName": "Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, University College London"}, "56333656200": {"Name": "Stirrup O.", "AuthorID": "56333656200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Institute for Global Health, University College London"}, "7004401932": {"Name": "Glidden D.", "AuthorID": "7004401932", "AffiliationID": "60023691", "AffiliationName": "Division of Biostatistics, University of California"}}}
