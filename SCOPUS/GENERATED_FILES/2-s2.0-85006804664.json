Psychophysiology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Society for Psychophysiological ResearchRespiratory physiology is influenced by cognitive processes. It has been suggested that some cognitive states may be inferred from respiration amplitude responses (RAR) after external events. Here, we investigate whether RAR allow assessment of fear memory in cued fear conditioning, an experimental model of aversive learning. To this end, we built on a previously developed psychophysiological model (PsPM) of RAR, which regards interpolated RAR time series as the output of a linear time invariant system. We first establish that average RAR after CS+ and CS\u2212 are different. We then develop the response function of fear-conditioned RAR, to be used in our PsPM. This PsPM is inverted to yield estimates of cognitive input into the respiratory system. We analyze five validation experiments involving fear acquisition and retention, delay and trace conditioning, short and medium CS-US intervals, and data acquired with bellows and MRI-compatible pressure chest belts. In all experiments, CS+ and CS\u2212 are distinguished by their estimated cognitive inputs, and the sensitivity of this distinction is higher for model-based estimates than for peak scoring of RAR. Comparing these data with skin conductance responses (SCR) and heart period responses (HPR), we find that, on average, RAR performs similar to SCR in distinguishing CS+ and CS\u2212, but is less sensitive than HPR. Overall, our work provides a novel and robust tool to investigate fear memory in humans that may allow wide and straightforward application to diverse experimental contexts.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Fear conditioning", "General linear model", "Heart period", "Psychophysiological model", "Respiration"], "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Conditioning, Classical", "Extinction, Psychological", "Fear", "Female", "Galvanic Skin Response", "Heart Rate", "Humans", "Male", "Models, Biological", "Models, Psychological", "Psychophysics", "Respiration", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85006804664", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"], ["Neuropsychology and Physiological Psychology", "PSYC", "3206"], ["Experimental and Cognitive Psychology", "PSYC", "3205"], ["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Endocrine and Autonomic Systems", "NEUR", "2807"], ["Developmental Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2806"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"], ["Biological Psychiatry", "NEUR", "2803"]], "AuthorData": {"56287763500": {"Name": "Castegnetti G.", "AuthorID": "56287763500", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Centre Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "39062360800": {"Name": "Tzovara A.", "AuthorID": "39062360800", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}, "56611973300": {"Name": "Staib M.", "AuthorID": "56611973300", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Centre Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "57190034277": {"Name": "Gerster S.", "AuthorID": "57190034277", "AffiliationID": "60012614", "AffiliationName": "Neuroscience Centre Zurich, University of Zurich"}, "9746516300": {"Name": "Bach D.", "AuthorID": "9746516300", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60084279", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London"}}}
