One of the major problems with existing stimulators is the limited waveform adjustability. This precludes the use of sophisticated stimulation programs and thereby affects the efficacy of the therapy applied. For this reason a new type of stimulator is required.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adjustability", "Neural stimulator", "Output stages", "Wave forms"], "DocumentType": "Conference Proceeding", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84964853065", "SubjectAreas": [["Electrical and Electronic Engineering", "ENGI", "2208"]], "AuthorData": {"37014115600": {"Name": "Van Dongen M.", "AuthorID": "37014115600", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Electronics Research Laboratory, Delft University of Technology"}, "7003394632": {"Name": "Serdijn W.", "AuthorID": "7003394632", "AffiliationID": "60006288", "AffiliationName": "Electronics Research Laboratory, Delft University of Technology"}}}
