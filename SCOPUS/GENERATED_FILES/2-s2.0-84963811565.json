Materials and Methods A retrospective single-center review of port removals was conducted between 2003 and 2012. Cases were identified through radiology reports. Clinical details (eg, demographics, disease, port dwell time, interventional techniques) were obtained through patient charts. Cases were classified as difficult removals if there was documented adherence to soft tissues or vein, or simple removals if no difficulty was recorded. Difficult removals were categorized and graded on increasing invasiveness of techniques required. Successful removal was defined as complete removal of the port catheter. Difficult removals were compared with simple removals for factors associated with difficult removal. Of all removals (N = 1,306), 58 were classified as difficult removals (4%). Results Using various techniques, 57 of 58 (98%) adherent port catheters were successfully removed. Factors identified with difficult removals included primary diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (78% vs 37%, P <.0001), age at insertion (3.7 y vs 5.4 y, P =.0019), and port dwell time (median 1,087 d vs 616 d, P <.0001). Conclusions Difficulty removing port catheters in children is uncommon. Port catheters can usually be removed successfully using various IR techniques ranging in invasiveness. There is an association of difficult removal with early age at insertion, ALL diagnosis, and long port dwell time. Awareness of these factors may help physicians inform parents of potential difficulties and plan the removal procedure.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Administration, Intravenous", "Adolescent", "Age Factors", "Antineoplastic Agents", "Catheterization, Central Venous", "Catheters, Indwelling", "Central Venous Catheters", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Device Removal", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Ontario", "Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma", "Radiography, Interventional", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Time Factors", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84963811565", "SubjectAreas": [["Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Imaging", "MEDI", "2741"], ["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"56957582400": {"Name": "Patel P.", "AuthorID": "56957582400", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Image Guided Therapy, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "23991305100": {"Name": "Parra D.", "AuthorID": "23991305100", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Image Guided Therapy, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "57188847729": {"Name": "Bath R.", "AuthorID": "57188847729", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Image Guided Therapy, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7006641489": {"Name": "Amaral J.", "AuthorID": "7006641489", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Image Guided Therapy, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7005077301": {"Name": "Temple M.", "AuthorID": "7005077301", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Image Guided Therapy, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7201871199": {"Name": "John P.", "AuthorID": "7201871199", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Image Guided Therapy, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}, "7103176747": {"Name": "Connolly B.", "AuthorID": "7103176747", "AffiliationID": "60030319, 60016849", "AffiliationName": "Division of Image Guided Therapy, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto"}}}
