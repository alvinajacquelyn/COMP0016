The information available for this find, including both its context and its inherent characteristics, opens up new perspectives for research into the technology, use, sociology and symbolism of gold during this time period. We describe and analyse this unique item in detail, including the characterization of the raw material used and the manufacturing process (via SEM-BSE and LA-ICP-MS), as well as an extensive reconstruction of the graphic motifs that are represented, by using digital imaging processing techniques (RTI). We compare this find with the data currently available for the (approximately) 100 Chalcolithic golden artefacts (or fragments of artefacts) found in Iberia to date. Finally, we present an appraisal of the social and ideological framework in which gold was used in Copper Age Iberia, discussing its relevance in aspects such as the dynamics of social complexity, worldviews or artistic creations.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84938746051", "SubjectAreas": [["Archeology (arts and humanities)", "ARTS", "1204"], ["Cultural Studies", "SOCI", "3316"], ["Archeology", "SOCI", "3302"]], "AuthorData": {"35574554200": {"Name": "Murillo-Barroso M.", "AuthorID": "35574554200", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University London, Institute of Archaeology"}, "56646514100": {"Name": "Eleazar Costa Carame M.", "AuthorID": "56646514100", "AffiliationID": "60033284", "AffiliationName": "Department of Prehistory and Archaeology, University of Seville"}, "56572970700": {"Name": "Garcia Sanjuan L.", "AuthorID": "56572970700", "AffiliationID": "60033284", "AffiliationName": "Department of Prehistory and Archaeology, University of Seville"}, "55349295700": {"Name": "Mora Molina C.", "AuthorID": "55349295700", "AffiliationID": "60033284", "AffiliationName": "Department of Prehistory and Archaeology, University of Seville"}, "56166038900": {"Name": "Diaz-Guardamino Uribe M.", "AuthorID": "56166038900", "AffiliationID": "60025225", "AffiliationName": "Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton"}}}
