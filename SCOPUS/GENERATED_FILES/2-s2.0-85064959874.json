Sixty-Two participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive placebo twice a day (bid) for 14 days, followed by placebo, 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg bid of trofinetide for 42 days. Following blinded safety data review, 20 additional participants were randomized 1:1 to the 200 mg/kg or placebo bid groups. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, and concomitant medications. Clinician-and caregiver-based efficacy measurements assessed clinically relevant, phenotypic dimensions of impairment of RTT.ResultsAll dose levels were well tolerated and generally safe. Trofinetide at 200 mg/kg bid showed statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements relative to placebo on the Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire, RTT-Clinician Domain Specific Concerns-Visual Analog Scale, and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement. Exploratory analyses suggested that observed changes correlated with trofinetide exposure.ConclusionThese results, together with those from a previous adolescent/adult trial, indicate trofinetide's potential for treating core RTT symptoms and support further trials.Classification of evidenceThis study provides Class I evidence that for children/adolescents with RTT, trofinetide was safe, well-Tolerated, and demonstrated improvement over placebo at 200 mg/kg bid in functionally important dimensions of RTT.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adolescent", "Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Double-Blind Method", "Female", "Glutamic Acid", "Humans", "Rett Syndrome", "Treatment Outcome"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85064959874", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"7005405167": {"Name": "Glaze D.G.", "AuthorID": "7005405167", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics and Neurology"}, "9269111500": {"Name": "Neul J.L.", "AuthorID": "9269111500", "AffiliationID": "60121548", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurosciences"}, "7202907785": {"Name": "Kaufmann W.E.", "AuthorID": "7202907785", "AffiliationID": "60030612", "AffiliationName": "University of California, Greenwood Genetic Center"}, "7003985402": {"Name": "Berry-Kravis E.", "AuthorID": "7003985402", "AffiliationID": "122119203", "AffiliationName": "Pediatrics, Neurological Sciences, and Biochemistry"}, "57208501364": {"Name": "Condon S.", "AuthorID": "57208501364", "AffiliationID": "115581117", "AffiliationName": "Vital Systems, Inc"}, "57195928120": {"Name": "Stoms G.", "AuthorID": "57195928120", "AffiliationID": "115581117", "AffiliationName": "Vital Systems, Inc"}, "57035360700": {"Name": "Oosterholt S.", "AuthorID": "57035360700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "8536932300": {"Name": "Della Pasqua O.", "AuthorID": "8536932300", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College"}, "56496439200": {"Name": "Glass L.", "AuthorID": "56496439200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics"}, "55892899200": {"Name": "Jones N.E.", "AuthorID": "55892899200", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": "Department of Pediatrics"}, "57201021697": {"Name": "Percy A.K.", "AuthorID": "57201021697", "AffiliationID": "60030769, 60003915", "AffiliationName": "Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Vanderbilt Kennedy Center"}}}
