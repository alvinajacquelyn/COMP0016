Methods: Under the context of the MEDIS study, 724 older adults (aged 65 to 100 years) from 8 Eastern Aegean Sea Greek islands (n = 100 living in Samothrace, 142 in Lesvos, 150 in Limnos, 76 in Ikaria, 52 in Kassos, 149 in Rhodes and Karpathos) and from Turkey (n = 55 older adults of Greek origin living on G\u00f6k\u00e7eada Island) were voluntarily recruited. Overall cardiometabolic risk was measured as the sum (range 0-4) of four common CVD risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and obesity). Results: Greek islanders had higher CVD scores compared to Greeks of G\u00f6k\u00e7eada (1.9 \u00b1 1.1 vs 1.4 \u00b1 1.0 risk factors/participant, p<0.001). Further analysis revealed that the diet of Greek islanders was similar to the traditional Mediterranean diet; however, these individuals demonstrated 2-times higher odds (95% CI, 1.04-3.87) for having hypertension, 1.53-times higher odds (95% CI, 0.66-3.54) for having diabetes, 3.29-times higher odds (95% CI, 1.58-6.81) for having hypercholesterolemia; whereas they had 0.78-times lower odds (95% CI, 0.40-1.52) for being obese, compared to elderly Greek adults living on G\u00f6k\u00e7eada. Conclusions: Overall, CVD risk seems to be low among Eastern Aegean Islanders; certain differences in CVD risk factors exist between Greek islanders and their counterparts living in G\u00f6k\u00e7eada, and those differences may be attributed to various environmental, cultural and lifestyle factors", "AuthorKeywords": ["Cardiometabolic risk", "Eastern Aegean islands", "G\u00f6k\u00e7eada", "Older adults"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Diet, Mediterranean", "Female", "Greece", "Humans", "Life Style", "Male", "Mediterranean Islands", "Risk Factors"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85020215485", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"57189514440": {"Name": "Foscolou A.", "AuthorID": "57189514440", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University"}, "6603568621": {"Name": "Polychronopoulos E.", "AuthorID": "6603568621", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University"}, "57194447902": {"Name": "Paka E.", "AuthorID": "57194447902", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University"}, "57207793475": {"Name": "Tyrovolas S.", "AuthorID": "57207793475", "AffiliationID": "60001576, 60104561", "AffiliationName": "Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, Fundaci\u00f3 Sant Joan de D\u00e9u, CIBERSAM, Universitat de Barcelona"}, "21833569800": {"Name": "Bountziouka V.", "AuthorID": "21833569800", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University"}, "56258809500": {"Name": "Tyrovola D.", "AuthorID": "56258809500", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University"}, "7005977027": {"Name": "Panagiotakos D.", "AuthorID": "7005977027", "AffiliationID": "60012296", "AffiliationName": "Department of Nutrition and Dietetics, School of Health Science and Education, Harokopio University"}, "6506978410": {"Name": "Zeimbekis A.", "AuthorID": "6506978410", "AffiliationID": "60082438", "AffiliationName": "Health Center of Kalloni, General Hospital of Mitilini"}, "6603790014": {"Name": "Ural D.", "AuthorID": "6603790014", "AffiliationID": "60006369", "AffiliationName": "Koc University School of Medicine"}}}
