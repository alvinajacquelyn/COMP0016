Libraries in particular are often characterised as symbolic of predigital literacy practices and forms of meaning making. This binary oversimplifies student engagement, particularly in relation to their creation of and interactions with texts. Two studies illustrate this: an investigation of student and staff textual practices that explored the complex and emergent networks they created, adapted and maintained; and one that explored perceptions and use of library spaces (digital and physical). A sociomaterial analysis shows the ongoing importance of institutional, personal and public spaces. This demonstrates that in order to enhance the student experience, a more nuanced understanding of the complex, emergent relationships between digital and print, device and user, and author and text is required.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-84934839963", "SubjectAreas": [["Education", "SOCI", "3304"]], "AuthorData": {"55878994300": {"Name": "Gourlay L.", "AuthorID": "55878994300", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "University of London"}, "56409371600": {"Name": "Oliver M.", "AuthorID": "56409371600", "AffiliationID": "60033387", "AffiliationName": "University of London"}, "36863839300": {"Name": "Lanclos D.M.", "AuthorID": "36863839300", "AffiliationID": "60006951", "AffiliationName": "University of North Carolina"}}}
