For acyclic Markov chains, we show that this problem is PP-complete, whereas it is hard for the PosSLP problem and in PSpace for general Markov chains. Moreover, for acyclic and general MDPs, we prove PSpace- and EXP-completeness, respectively. Our results have direct implications on the complexity of computing reward quantiles in succinctly represented stochastic systems.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Boolean combinations", "Markov Decision Processes", "Nonnegative integers"], "DocumentType": "Book Series", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84943609810", "SubjectAreas": [["Theoretical Computer Science", "MATH", "2614"], ["Computer Science (all)", "COMP", "1700"]], "AuthorData": {"35090201500": {"Name": "Haase C.", "AuthorID": "35090201500", "AffiliationID": "60105997, 60004981", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire Sp\u00e9cification et V\u00e9rification (LSV), CNRS and ENS de Cachan"}, "19639141300": {"Name": "Kiefer S.", "AuthorID": "19639141300", "AffiliationID": "60026851", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"}}}
