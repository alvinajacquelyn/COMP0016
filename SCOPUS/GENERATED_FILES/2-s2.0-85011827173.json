Although Australia has long been suggested as a place of origin for the species, this remains unclear. We tested for genetic patterns across the range of F. enigmaticus in southern Australia, predicting that if the species is an Australian native, it would show evidence of (east-west) phylogeographic patterns often observed in native marine species in southern Australia. Unexpectedly, concordant patterns from mitochondrial (Cyt B) sequencing and nuclear marker (iSSR) profiles suggested the presence of at least three genetic groups (putative species), not distributed simply as \u201ceast\u201d or \u201cwest\u201d. Two common (and closely related) groups were present across Australia and were often found together in the same aggregations. A third group was only found in southeast Australia and was morphologically similar to F. uschakovi (Pillai, 1960), a species previously reported from tropical areas. The discovery of multiple cryptic species with overlapping ranges means that more work is needed to resolve whether any of the F. enigmaticus sensu lato group has an Australian origin and to determine how they are related to invasive populations of F. enigmaticus elsewhere.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Annelida", "Cryptic species", "Estuaries", "Invasions", "Serpulidae"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85011827173", "SubjectAreas": [["Aquatic Science", "AGRI", "1104"], ["Water Science and Technology", "ENVI", "2312"]], "AuthorData": {"57204205089": {"Name": "Styan C.A.", "AuthorID": "57204205089", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "School of Energy and Resources, UCL Australia, University College London"}, "57193221011": {"Name": "McCluskey C.F.", "AuthorID": "57193221011", "AffiliationID": "60089707, 60018805", "AffiliationName": "School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Deakin University"}, "55737774800": {"Name": "Sun Y.", "AuthorID": "55737774800", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University"}, "6701766448": {"Name": "Kupriyanova E.K.", "AuthorID": "6701766448", "AffiliationID": "60019544", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biological Sciences, Macquarie University"}}}
