Methods: A modified Delphi process was used to develop a series of evidence-based statements on the role of high-definition white light (HDWL) and i-Scan for the detection and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms. Each statement was voted to achieve consensus (i.e. >80% agreement). Results: Seven proposed statements achieved consensus: (1) HDWL is recommended rather than standard definition (SD) for detection and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms; (2) HDWL colonoscopy with i-Scan improves polyp and adenoma detection rates when compared with SD colonoscopy; (3) HDWL + i-Scan is superior to HDWL alone for the optical diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms; (4) HDWL + i-Scan in expert hands meets American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) in the Preservation and Incorporation of Valuable Endoscopic Innovations (PIVI) standards for optical diagnosis of diminutive neoplasms; (5) HDWL + i-Scan in non-expert hands does not meet ASGE PIVI standards for optical diagnosis of diminutive neoplasms; (6) optical diagnosis of polyps with i-Scan has a learning curve and needs systematic training; and (7) the performance of i-Scan for the in vivo diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms is similar to Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) and Fuji Intelligent Chromo Endoscopy (FICE). Conclusions: Seven proposed statements on the use of HDWL and i-Scan for the detection and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms achieved consensus.", "AuthorKeywords": ["colon", "colonoscopy", "colorectal neoplasm", "colorectal polyp", "endoscopic diagnosis", "i-Scan", "image-enhanced endoscopy"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044917777", "SubjectAreas": [["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"], ["Gastroenterology", "MEDI", "2715"]], "AuthorData": {"8289974500": {"Name": "Bhandari P.", "AuthorID": "8289974500", "AffiliationID": "60030382", "AffiliationName": "Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust"}, "36115111400": {"Name": "Thayalasekaran S.", "AuthorID": "36115111400", "AffiliationID": "60030382", "AffiliationName": "Portsmouth Hospitals NHS trust"}, "35976311600": {"Name": "Keisslich R.", "AuthorID": "35976311600", "AffiliationID": "115125071", "AffiliationName": "DKD HELIOS Klinik Wiesbaden"}, "57201459495": {"Name": "Hoffmann A.", "AuthorID": "57201459495", "AffiliationID": "115125071", "AffiliationName": "DKD HELIOS Klinik Wiesbaden"}, "6701827503": {"Name": "Bisschops R.", "AuthorID": "6701827503", "AffiliationID": "60031069", "AffiliationName": "Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospitals Leuven"}, "37120187600": {"Name": "Haidry R.", "AuthorID": "37120187600", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "University College London"}, "56052962100": {"Name": "Esteban J.", "AuthorID": "56052962100", "AffiliationID": "60032461", "AffiliationName": "Hospital Clinico Universitario San Carlos"}, "56552751700": {"Name": "L\u00f3pez Viedma B.", "AuthorID": "56552751700", "AffiliationID": "60101745", "AffiliationName": "Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real"}, "6506623443": {"Name": "Godzhello E.", "AuthorID": "6506623443", "AffiliationID": "60110189", "AffiliationName": "Petrovsky Russian Scientific Center of Surgery RAMS"}, "55665024700": {"Name": "Almadi M.", "AuthorID": "55665024700", "AffiliationID": "60032134, 60013183", "AffiliationName": "King Khalid University Hospital, Medicine, King Saud University"}, "23100999100": {"Name": "Neumann H.", "AuthorID": "23100999100", "AffiliationID": "60029931", "AffiliationName": "University Hospital Erlangen"}, "6602936074": {"Name": "Sanduleanu S.", "AuthorID": "6602936074", "AffiliationID": "60007895", "AffiliationName": "Maastricht University Medical Center"}}}
