As orientation selectivity is already present at eye opening, it remains unclear how this specificity in network wiring contributes to feature selectivity. Using large-scale inhibition-dominated spiking networks as a model, we show that feature-specific connectivity leads to a linear amplification of feedforward tuning, consistent with recent electrophysiological single-neuron recordings in rodent neocortex. Our results show that optimal amplification is achieved at an intermediate regime of specific connectivity. In this configuration a moderate increase of pairwise correlations is observed, consistent with recent experimental findings. Furthermore, we observed that feature-specific connectivity leads to the emergence of orientation-selective reverberating activity, and entails pattern completion in network responses. Our theoretical analysis provides a mechanistic understanding of subnetworks' responses to visual stimuli, and casts light on the regime of operation of sensory cortices in the presence of specific connectivity.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Evoked Potentials, Visual", "Mice", "Models, Neurological", "Neocortex", "Nerve Net", "Neurons", "Orientation", "Photic Stimulation", "Visual Cortex", "Visual Pathways"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84939124596", "SubjectAreas": [["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology (all)", "BIOC", "1300"], ["Agricultural and Biological Sciences (all)", "AGRI", "1100"], ["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"55928013100": {"Name": "Sadeh S.", "AuthorID": "55928013100", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London"}, "7004581948": {"Name": "Rotter S.", "AuthorID": "7004581948", "AffiliationID": "60025641", "AffiliationName": "Bernstein Center Freiburg, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg"}, "16241056400": {"Name": "Clopath C.", "AuthorID": "16241056400", "AffiliationID": "60015150", "AffiliationName": "Bioengineering Department, Imperial College London"}}}
