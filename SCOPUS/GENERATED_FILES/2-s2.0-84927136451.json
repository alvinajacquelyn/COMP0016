Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.The objective of the present review was to summarize the evidence available on the temporal sequence of hard and soft tissue healing around titanium dental implants in animal models and in humans. A search was undertaken to find animal and human studies reporting on the temporal dynamics of hard and soft tissue integration of titanium dental implants. Moreover, the influence of implant surface roughness and chemistry on the molecular mechanisms associated with osseointegration was also investigated. The findings indicated that the integration of titanium dental implants into hard and soft tissue represents the result of a complex cascade of biological events initiated by the surgical intervention. Implant placement into alveolar bone induces a cascade of healing events starting with clot formation and continuing with the maturation of bone in contact with the implant surface. From a genetic point of view, osseointegration is associated with a decrease in inflammation and an increase in osteogenesis-, angiogenesis- and neurogenesis-associated gene expression during the early stages of wound healing. The attachment and maturation of the soft tissue complex (i.e. epithelium and connective tissue) to implants becomes established 6-8 weeks following surgery. Based on the findings of the present review it can be concluded that improved understanding of the mechanisms associated with osseointegration will provide leads and targets for strategies aimed at enhancing the clinical performance of titanium dental implants.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Dental Implantation, Endosseous", "Gene Expression Regulation", "Humans", "Models, Animal", "Neovascularization, Physiologic", "Neurogenesis", "Osseointegration", "Osteogenesis", "Titanium", "Wound Healing"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927136451", "SubjectAreas": [["Periodontics", "DENT", "3506"]], "AuthorData": {"35600695300": {"Name": "Salvi G.", "AuthorID": "35600695300", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6603806230": {"Name": "Bosshardt D.", "AuthorID": "6603806230", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7201577367": {"Name": "Lang N.", "AuthorID": "7201577367", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "9635463000": {"Name": "Abrahamsson I.", "AuthorID": "9635463000", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "26643204700": {"Name": "Berglundh T.", "AuthorID": "26643204700", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "57203625223": {"Name": "Lindhe J.", "AuthorID": "57203625223", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "6601979085": {"Name": "Ivanovski S.", "AuthorID": "6601979085", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}, "7004314492": {"Name": "Donos N.", "AuthorID": "7004314492", "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
