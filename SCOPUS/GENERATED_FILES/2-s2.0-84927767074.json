However, MRD assessment does not guide routine clinical management and its assessment remains complex. We incorporated detection of the B cell, tumor-specific antigen CD160 to develop a single-tube, flow cytometry assay (CD160FCA) for CLL MRD to a threshold of 10-4 to 10 - 5. One hundred and eighty-seven patients treated for CLL were enrolled. Utilizing the CD160FCA methodology, there was a high level of comparison between blood and bone marrow (R = 0.87, P<o0.001). In a validation cohort, CD160FCA and the international standardised approach of the European Research Initiative on CLL group demonstrated high concordance (R = 0.91, P<o0.01). Patients in complete remission (CR) and CD160FCA negative had longer event-free survival (EFS) (63 vs 16 months, P<o0.01) and prolonged time to next treatment (60 vs 15 months, <o0.001)vsD positive patients; with a median time to MRD positivity of 36 months. In multivariate analysis, CD160FCA MRD detection was independently predictive of EFS in patients in CR and even predicted EFS in the good-risk cytogenetic subgroup. CD160FCA offers a simple assay for MRD detection in CLL and gives prognostic information across different CLL risk groups.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Adult", "Aged", "Antigens, CD", "Chlorambucil", "Disease-Free Survival", "Female", "Flow Cytometry", "GPI-Linked Proteins", "Humans", "Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Neoplasm, Residual", "Prognosis", "Receptors, Immunologic"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84927767074", "SubjectAreas": [["Hematology", "MEDI", "2720"], ["Oncology", "MEDI", "2730"]], "AuthorData": {"26423626100": {"Name": "Farren T.W.", "AuthorID": "26423626100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7007100957": {"Name": "Macey M.G.", "AuthorID": "7007100957", "AffiliationID": "60004093, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haemato-Oncology, Barts Health NHS Trust, St. Bartholomew's Hospital"}, "7403054897": {"Name": "Agrawal S.G.", "AuthorID": "7403054897", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "35336405400": {"Name": "Fanous M.", "AuthorID": "35336405400", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "36072565100": {"Name": "Liu F.", "AuthorID": "36072565100", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Pathology Group, Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London"}, "6508175354": {"Name": "Giustiniani J.", "AuthorID": "6508175354", "AffiliationID": "60010028", "AffiliationName": "Laboratoire de Th\u00e9rapie Cellulaire, Institut Jean Godinot"}, "7201445690": {"Name": "Wright F.", "AuthorID": "7201445690", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "7103081042": {"Name": "Prentice A.", "AuthorID": "7103081042", "AffiliationID": "60032819", "AffiliationName": "Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital"}, "6603785385": {"Name": "Nathwani A.", "AuthorID": "6603785385", "AffiliationID": "60109234, 60022148", "AffiliationName": "UCL Cancer Institute, University College London"}}}
