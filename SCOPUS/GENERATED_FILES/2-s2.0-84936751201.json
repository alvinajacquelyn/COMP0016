Meta-analyses of this data have shown that statins have a beneficial effect on treated groups compared to control groups, reducing cardiovascular risk. Inhibiting the HMG-CoA reductase in the liver, statins can reduce cholesterol levels, thus reducing LDL levels in circulation. Published data from intravascular ultrasound studies (IVUS) was used in this work to develop and validate a unique integrative system model; this consisted of analyzing control groups from two randomized controlled statins trials (24/97 subjects respectively), one treated group (40 subjects, simvastatin trial), and 27 male subjects (simvastatin, pharmacokinetic study). The model allows to simulate the pharmacokinetics of statins and its effect on the dynamics of lipoproteins (e.g., LDL) and the inflammatory pathway while simultaneously exploring the effect of flow-related variables (e.g., wall shear stress) on atherosclerosis progression.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84936751201", "SubjectAreas": [["Modeling and Simulation", "MATH", "2611"], ["Pharmacology (medical)", "MEDI", "2736"]], "AuthorData": {"8241424500": {"Name": "Pichardo-Almarza C.", "AuthorID": "8241424500", "AffiliationID": "113230991", "AffiliationName": "Xenologiq Ltd"}, "57054142800": {"Name": "Metcalf L.", "AuthorID": "57054142800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "23984658900": {"Name": "Diaz-Zuccarini V.", "AuthorID": "23984658900", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Mechanical Engineering, University College London"}, "7101962363": {"Name": "Finkelstein A.", "AuthorID": "7101962363", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science, University College London"}}}
