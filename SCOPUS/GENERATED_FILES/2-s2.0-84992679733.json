All rights reserved.Although vestibular migraine is a common cause of vertigo, affecting approximately 1% of the Western world\u2019s population, it remains widely under-recognized and is under-diagnosed. Diagnostic criteria for vestibular migraine were recently published in collaboration with the International Headache Society and the B\u00e1r\u00e1ny-Society. Trials investigating the treatment of vestibular migraine are sparse but some are now underway. This review focuses on the treatments options available for vestibular migraine, based on the existing evidence base where available. Regarding acute treatments, there are two randomized controlled trials that provide evidence for the use of triptans (zolmitriptan and rizatriptan) for the management of vestibular migraine attacks. For prophylactic treatment, the evidence base is largely non-existent, since the only multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial testing metoprolol versus placebo is still underway. Consequently, the treatment recommendations for the prophylactic treatment of vestibular migraine are mainly based on expert opinion and the treatments guidelines for migraine with and without aura.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Dizziness", "Migraine", "Migraine with aura", "Vertigo", "Vestibular migraine"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84992679733", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Neurology (clinical)", "MEDI", "2728"]], "AuthorData": {"35792636300": {"Name": "Naegel S.", "AuthorID": "35792636300", "AffiliationID": "60014264", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neurology, Vertigo and Dizziness Center, West-German Headache Center, University of Duisburg-Essen"}, "14020024800": {"Name": "Obermann M.", "AuthorID": "14020024800", "AffiliationID": "115748360", "AffiliationName": "Center for Neurology, Asklepios Hospitals Schildautal"}, "6701699175": {"Name": "Matharu M.", "AuthorID": "6701699175", "AffiliationID": "60020736, 60019953, 60024544", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Neurology, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London Hospitals"}}}
