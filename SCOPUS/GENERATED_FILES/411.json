Informed by Kuhn\u2019s notion of scientific paradigms, the method seeks to develop storylines of how research on a given topic unfolds over time, highlighting key discoveries and insights. This article reports how we drew on the meta-narrative approach in a review that examined the changing and contested nature of \u2018community\u2019 as understood across disciplines and research traditions. We discuss the challenges that arose in our review and the strengths and limitations of our approach. We conclude that the meta-narrative approach provides a useful framework for making sense of the multiple and changing conceptualisations of community while accounting for historical context. We recommend that an avenue for further development of the method is to consider Foucault\u2019s sociological approach to tracing knowledge.", "AuthorKeywords": ["community", "meta-narrative", "qualitative", "synthesis", "theory"], "IndexKeywords": null, "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 0, "EID": "2-s2.0-84930448396", "SubjectAreas": [["Social Sciences (miscellaneous)", "SOCI", "3301"], ["History and Philosophy of Science", "ARTS", "1207"]], "AuthorData": {"41861770600": {"Name": "Jamal F.", "AuthorID": "41861770600", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "University of East London"}, "35174399200": {"Name": "Bertotti M.", "AuthorID": "35174399200", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "University of East London"}, "7005196568": {"Name": "Harden A.", "AuthorID": "7005196568", "AffiliationID": "60026116", "AffiliationName": "University of East London"}, "36147814900": {"Name": "Lorenc T.", "AuthorID": "36147814900", "AffiliationID": "60031331", "AffiliationName": "London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine"}}}
