In this article, we show that administration of apoptotic dendritic cells (DCs) inhibited inflammation in vivo through increasing production of TGF-\u03b2 from intrinsic DCs and B cells. However, ACs derived from LPS-activated DCs failed to restrain inflammation because of a short-lived but marked IL-6 response, which abolished the increase in TGF-\u03b2. Inhibition of IL-6 restored the protective anti-inflammatory properties of aACs and the TGF-\u03b2 response. DCs isolated from mice that had received resting but not activated ACs could transfer the suppression of inflammation to recipient mice. These transferred DCs stimulated B cell TGF-\u03b2 production and relied on an intact B cell compartment to limit inflammation. These results highlight how the activation state of AC governs their ability to control inflammation through reciprocal regulation of IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Apoptosis", "Arthritis, Experimental", "Dendritic Cells", "Flow Cytometry", "Inflammation", "Interleukin-6", "Macrophages", "Mice", "Mice, Inbred C57BL", "Microscopy, Confocal", "Phagocytosis", "Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Transforming Growth Factor beta"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84922511637", "SubjectAreas": [["Immunology and Allergy", "MEDI", "2723"], ["Immunology", "IMMU", "2403"]], "AuthorData": {"23089153400": {"Name": "Notley C.", "AuthorID": "23089153400", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "57197409372": {"Name": "Brown M.", "AuthorID": "57197409372", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "55574125500": {"Name": "McGovern J.", "AuthorID": "55574125500", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "56511185800": {"Name": "Jordan C.", "AuthorID": "56511185800", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}, "7004262550": {"Name": "Ehrenstein M.", "AuthorID": "7004262550", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Division of Medicine, Centre for Rheumatology, University College London"}}}
