We introduce a new technique for cortical network mapping based on inter-regional similarity of multiple morphometric parameters measured using multimodal MRI. In three cohorts (two human, one macaque), we find that the resulting morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) have a complex topological organization comprising modules and high-degree hubs. Human MSN modules recapitulate known cortical cytoarchitectonic divisions, and greater inter-regional morphometric similarity was associated with stronger inter-regional co-expression of genes enriched for neuronal terms. Comparing macaque MSNs with tract-tracing data confirmed that morphometric similarity was related to axonal connectivity. Finally, variation in the degree of human MSN nodes accounted for about 40% of between-subject variability in IQ. Morphometric similarity mapping provides a novel, robust, and biologically plausible approach to understanding how human cortical networks underpin individual differences in psychological functions. Morphometric similarity mapping is a robust new method to examine the structural organization of individual brains in vivo. It provides morphometric similarity networks (MSNs) that capture cellular, molecular, and functional features of the brain and predict inter-individual differences in cognition.", "AuthorKeywords": ["connectome", "cross-species", "cytoarchitecture", "gene expression", "IQ", "macaque", "morphology", "MRI", "multi-modal"], "IndexKeywords": ["Animals", "Cerebral Cortex", "Cognition", "Connectome", "Female", "Humans", "Intelligence", "Macaca", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Neural Pathways", "Young Adult"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85038870052", "SubjectAreas": [["Neuroscience (all)", "NEUR", "2800"]], "AuthorData": {"7801489546": {"Name": "Seidlitz J.", "AuthorID": "7801489546", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurogenomics Unit, National Institute of Mental Health"}, "56708883800": {"Name": "V\u00e1\u0161a F.", "AuthorID": "56708883800", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Psychiatry"}, "57194653839": {"Name": "Shinn M.", "AuthorID": "57194653839", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Psychiatry"}, "54879566700": {"Name": "Romero-Garcia R.", "AuthorID": "54879566700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Psychiatry"}, "24774205600": {"Name": "Whitaker K.J.", "AuthorID": "24774205600", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Psychiatry"}, "48862093400": {"Name": "V\u00e9rtes P.E.", "AuthorID": "48862093400", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Psychiatry"}, "56538706700": {"Name": "Wagstyl K.", "AuthorID": "56538706700", "AffiliationID": "60031101", "AffiliationName": "University of Cambridge, Department of Psychiatry"}, "26021246400": {"Name": "Jones P.B.", "AuthorID": "26021246400", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "7005728308": {"Name": "Goodyer I.M.", "AuthorID": "7005728308", "AffiliationID": "60005210", "AffiliationName": "Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust"}, "35405771500": {"Name": "Bullmore E.T.", "AuthorID": "35405771500", "AffiliationID": "60020649", "AffiliationName": "ImmunoPsychiatry, Immuno-Inflammation Therapeutic Area Unit, GlaxoSmithKline R&D"}, "57200015286": {"Name": "Kirkpatrick Reardon P.", "AuthorID": "57200015286", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurogenomics Unit, National Institute of Mental Health"}, "6507299504": {"Name": "Clasen L.", "AuthorID": "6507299504", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurogenomics Unit, National Institute of Mental Health"}, "54407179400": {"Name": "Liu S.", "AuthorID": "54407179400", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurogenomics Unit, National Institute of Mental Health"}, "57210439822": {"Name": "Raznahan A.", "AuthorID": "57210439822", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Developmental Neurogenomics Unit, National Institute of Mental Health"}, "8145694700": {"Name": "Messinger A.", "AuthorID": "8145694700", "AffiliationID": "60003158", "AffiliationName": "Laboratory of Brain and Cognition, National Institute of Mental Health"}, "7102017697": {"Name": "Leopold D.A.", "AuthorID": "7102017697", "AffiliationID": "60003158, 60007651, 60013780", "AffiliationName": "Neurophysiology Imaging Facility, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Eye Institute"}, "7004981532": {"Name": "Fonagy P.", "AuthorID": "7004981532", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London"}, "55027467100": {"Name": "Dolan R.J.", "AuthorID": "55027467100", "AffiliationID": "60122566", "AffiliationName": "Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research"}, "null": {"Name": null, "AuthorID": null, "AffiliationID": null, "AffiliationName": null}}}
