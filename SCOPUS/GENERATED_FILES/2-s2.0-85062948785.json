Plug\u2019n\u2019play multisensor integration helps to manage complexity But is it practical? Machine learning is not a replacement for Bayesian estimation But, does it still have uses in navigation? A hybrid batch-recursive estimator is a good approach to multi-epoch multi-sensor Fault Detection Are there any alternative proposals? Maintaining integrity in a complex multisensor system is very difficult.
