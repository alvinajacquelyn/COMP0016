Few studies have investigated the differences in gene expression between the left and right atrial appendages, leaving their characterization largely unexplored. In this study, differential gene expression was investigated in atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm using left and right atrial appendages from the same patients. RNA sequencing was performed on the left and right atrial appendages from five sinus rhythm (SR) control patients and five permanent AF case patients. Differential gene expression in both the left and right atrial appendages was analyzed using the Bioconductor package edgeR. A selection of differentially expressed genes, with relevance to atrial fibrillation, were further validated using quantitative RT-PCR. The distribution of the samples assessed through principal component analysis showed distinct grouping between left and right atrial appendages and between SR controls and AF cases. Overall 157 differentially expressed genes were identified to be downregulated and 90 genes upregulated in AF. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated a greater involvement of left atrial genes in the Wnt signaling pathway whereas right atrial genes were involved in clathrin-coated vesicle and collagen formation. The differing expression of genes in both left and right atrial appendages indicate that there are different mechanisms for development, support and remodeling of AF within the left and right atria.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Atrial fibrillation", "Differential gene expression", "Right and left atria", "RNA sequencing"], "IndexKeywords": ["Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Atrial Appendage", "Atrial Fibrillation", "Clathrin-Coated Vesicles", "Cohort Studies", "Collagen", "Coronary Artery Bypass", "Down-Regulation", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction", "Sequence Analysis, RNA", "Signal Transduction", "Transcriptome", "Up-Regulation", "Wnt Signaling Pathway"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85070421688", "SubjectAreas": [["Physiology", "BIOC", "1314"], ["Genetics", "BIOC", "1311"]], "AuthorData": {"8539041500": {"Name": "Thomas A.M.", "AuthorID": "8539041500", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Centre, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57201181791": {"Name": "Cabrera C.P.", "AuthorID": "57201181791", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Bioinformatics, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "6701811348": {"Name": "Nobles M.", "AuthorID": "6701811348", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "Clinical Pharmacology, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "57217638046": {"Name": "Barnes M.R.", "AuthorID": "57217638046", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Translational Bioinformatics, William Harvey Research Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry"}, "57220337854": {"Name": "Munroe P.B.", "AuthorID": "57220337854", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Centre, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "7005427027": {"Name": "Tinker A.", "AuthorID": "7005427027", "AffiliationID": "60021435, 60022109", "AffiliationName": "NIHR Barts Cardiovascular Biomedical Research Centre, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London"}, "34971090100": {"Name": "Finlay M.", "AuthorID": "34971090100", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "6603762926": {"Name": "Lall K.", "AuthorID": "6603762926", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "7201390233": {"Name": "Schilling R.J.", "AuthorID": "7201390233", "AffiliationID": "60004093", "AffiliationName": "Barts Heart Centre, St. Bartholomew\u2019s Hospital"}, "56729886500": {"Name": "Wood K.", "AuthorID": "56729886500", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts and London Genome Centre, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Blizard Institute"}, "6603586476": {"Name": "Mein C.A.", "AuthorID": "6603586476", "AffiliationID": "60021435", "AffiliationName": "Barts and London Genome Centre, School of Medicine and Dentistry, Blizard Institute"}}}
