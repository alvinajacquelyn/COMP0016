This study evaluated the association of genetic risk markers previously identified in whites and CHD in Afro-Caribbeans. Methods We studied 537 Afro-Caribbean individuals (178 CHD cases and 359 controls) who were genotyped for 19 CHD-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A genetic risk score (GRS) incorporating the 19 SNPs was calculated. These participants were compared with 1360 white individuals from the Second Northwick Park Heart Study. Results In Afro-Caribbeans, patients with CHD had higher rates of hypertension (78.7% vs 30.1%), hypercholesterolemia (52.8% vs 15.0%), and diabetes (53.9% vs 14.8%) and were more often men (64.0% vs 43.7%) and smokers (27.5% vs 13.4%) compared with non-CHD controls (all P < 0.001). The GRS was higher in Afro-Caribbeans with CHD than in those without CHD (13.90 vs 13.17; P < 0.001) and was significantly associated with CHD after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, with an odds ratio of 1.40 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.80) per standard deviation change. There were significant differences in allelic distributions between the 2 ethnic groups for 14 of the 19 SNPs. The GRS was substantially lower in Afro-Caribbean controls compared with white controls (13.17 vs 16.59; P < 0.001). Conclusions This study demonstrates that a multilocus GRS composed of 19 SNPs associated with CHD in whites is a strong predictor of the disease in Afro-Caribbeans. The differences in CHD occurrence between Afro-Caribbeans and whites might be a result of significant discrepancies in common gene variant distribution.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["African Continental Ancestry Group", "Case-Control Studies", "Coronary Disease", "Diabetes Mellitus", "European Continental Ancestry Group", "Female", "Gene Frequency", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Genotype", "Guadeloupe", "Humans", "Hypercholesterolemia", "Hypertension", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide", "Risk Assessment", "Smoking"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84959933661", "SubjectAreas": [["Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine", "MEDI", "2705"]], "AuthorData": {"8046845100": {"Name": "Larifla L.", "AuthorID": "8046845100", "AffiliationID": "112508336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Hospital of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre"}, "55901954500": {"Name": "Foucan L.", "AuthorID": "55901954500", "AffiliationID": "60170371", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Clinical Epidemiology and Medicine, ECM/L.A.M.I.A EA 4540, University Hospital of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre, University of Antilles"}, "6603289242": {"Name": "Bangou J.", "AuthorID": "6603289242", "AffiliationID": "60170371", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Clinical Epidemiology and Medicine, ECM/L.A.M.I.A EA 4540, University Hospital of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre, University of Antilles"}, "12646912400": {"Name": "Velayoudom-Cephise F.L.", "AuthorID": "12646912400", "AffiliationID": "60170371", "AffiliationName": "Research Group Clinical Epidemiology and Medicine, ECM/L.A.M.I.A EA 4540, University Hospital of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre, University of Antilles"}, "56584579500": {"Name": "Beaney K.E.", "AuthorID": "56584579500", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "25932124200": {"Name": "Cooper J.A.", "AuthorID": "25932124200", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "57217317601": {"Name": "Humphries S.E.", "AuthorID": "57217317601", "AffiliationID": "60022148, 60100024", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, British Heart Foundation Laboratories, Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, University College London"}, "56124004100": {"Name": "Michel C.T.", "AuthorID": "56124004100", "AffiliationID": "112508336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Hospital of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre"}, "57155968400": {"Name": "Martino J.", "AuthorID": "57155968400", "AffiliationID": "112508336", "AffiliationName": "Department of Cardiology, University Hospital of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre"}}}
