WHO estimated 600 000 cases of rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis in 2016\u2014of which 490 000 were multidrug resistant (MDR), with less than 50% survival after receiving recommended treatment regimens. Concerted efforts of stakeholders, advocates, and researchers are advancing further development of shorter course, more effective, safer, and better tolerated treatment regimens. We review the developmental pipeline and landscape of new and repurposed tuberculosis drugs, treatment regimens, and host-directed therapies (HDTs) for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis. 14 candidate drugs for drug-susceptible, drug-resistant, and latent tuberculosis are in clinical stages of drug development; nine are novel in phase 1 and 2 trials, and three new drugs are in advanced stages of development for MDR tuberculosis. Specific updates are provided on clinical trials of bedaquiline, delamanid, pretomanid, and other licensed or repurposed drugs that are undergoing investigation, including trials aimed at shortening duration of tuberculosis treatment, improving treatment outcomes and patient adherence, and reducing toxic effects. Ongoing clinical trials for shortening tuberculosis treatment duration, improving treatment outcomes in MDR tuberculosis, and preventing disease in people with latent tuberculosis infection are reviewed. A range of HDTs and immune-based treatments are under investigation as adjunctive therapy for shortening duration of therapy, preventing permanent lung injury, and improving treatment outcomes of MDR tuberculosis. We discuss the HDT development pipeline, ongoing clinical trials, and translational research efforts for adjunct tuberculosis treatment.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Antitubercular Agents", "Combined Modality Therapy", "Drug Development", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Humans", "Mycobacterium tuberculosis", "Tuberculosis"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 2, "EID": "2-s2.0-85044296948", "SubjectAreas": [["Infectious Diseases", "MEDI", "2725"]], "AuthorData": {"57218613585": {"Name": "Tiberi S.", "AuthorID": "57218613585", "AffiliationID": "60010088, 60159931", "AffiliationName": "Division of Infection, Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust"}, "7801566485": {"Name": "du Plessis N.", "AuthorID": "7801566485", "AffiliationID": "60001565, 60008907", "AffiliationName": "South African Department of Science and Technology, and National Research Foundation Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Tuberculosis Research, Stellenbosch University"}, "56050296500": {"Name": "Walzl G.", "AuthorID": "56050296500", "AffiliationID": "60001565, 60008907", "AffiliationName": "South African Department of Science and Technology, and National Research Foundation Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Tuberculosis Research, Stellenbosch University"}, "56526973000": {"Name": "Vjecha M.J.", "AuthorID": "56526973000", "AffiliationID": "60020147", "AffiliationName": "Veterans Affairs Medical Center"}, "57216111663": {"Name": "Rao M.", "AuthorID": "57216111663", "AffiliationID": "60010405", "AffiliationName": "Krankenhaus Nordwest"}, "7004422039": {"Name": "Maeurer M.J.", "AuthorID": "7004422039", "AffiliationID": "60010405", "AffiliationName": "Krankenhaus Nordwest"}, "7004125689": {"Name": "Ntoumi F.", "AuthorID": "7004125689", "AffiliationID": "106024327", "AffiliationName": "Fondation Congolaise pour la Recherche Medicale, and Faculte des Sciences et Techniques, Universite M Ngouabi"}, "6603198848": {"Name": "Mfinanga S.", "AuthorID": "6603198848", "AffiliationID": "60071565", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Medical Research, Muhimbili Medical Research Centre"}, "56744548100": {"Name": "Mwaba P.", "AuthorID": "56744548100", "AffiliationID": "60072796", "AffiliationName": "UNZA-UCLMS Research and Training Programme, and Apex University"}, "23992930000": {"Name": "Kapata N.", "AuthorID": "23992930000", "AffiliationID": "60072803", "AffiliationName": "Institute of Public Health, Ministry of Health"}, "7102706668": {"Name": "Ippolito G.", "AuthorID": "7102706668", "AffiliationID": "60072494", "AffiliationName": "National Institute for Infectious Disease, L Spallanzani"}, "7005608870": {"Name": "Migliori G.B.", "AuthorID": "7005608870", "AffiliationID": "60027142, 60018722", "AffiliationName": "World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Maugeri Care and Research Institute, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Sceintifico"}, "7007165041": {"Name": "McHugh T.D.", "AuthorID": "7007165041", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Centre for Clinical Microbiology, Division of Infection and Immunity, University College London"}, "7006170723": {"Name": "Zumla A.", "AuthorID": "7006170723", "AffiliationID": "60024544", "AffiliationName": "National Institute of Health and Research Biomedical Research Centre, UCL Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust"}}}
