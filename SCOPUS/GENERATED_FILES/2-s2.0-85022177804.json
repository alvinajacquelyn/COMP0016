However, such a mapping is generally ill-defined; for instance, diffusion measurements are antipodally symmetric (diffusion along x and \u2013x are equal), whereas the distribution of fibre orientations within a voxel is generally not symmetric. Therefore, different sub-voxel patterns such as crossing, fanning, or sharp bending, cannot be distinguished by fitting a voxel-wise model to the signal. However, asymmetric fibre patterns can potentially be distinguished once spatial information from neighbouring voxels is taken into account. We propose a neighbourhood-constrained spherical deconvolution approach that is capable of inferring asymmetric fibre orientation distributions (A-fods). Importantly, we further design and implement a tractography algorithm that utilises the estimated A-fods, since the commonly used streamline tractography paradigm cannot directly take advantage of the new information. We assess performance using ultra-high resolution histology data where we can compare true orientation distributions against sub-voxel fibre patterns estimated from down-sampled data. Finally, we explore the benefits of A-fods-based tractography using in vivo data by evaluating agreement of tractography predictions with connectivity estimates made using different in-vivo modalities. The proposed approach can reliably estimate complex fibre patterns such as sharp bending and fanning, which voxel-wise approaches cannot estimate. Moreover, histology-based and in-vivo results show that the new framework allows more accurate tractography and reconstruction of maps quantifying (symmetric and asymmetric) fibre complexity.", "AuthorKeywords": ["Asymmetry", "Connectome", "Diffusion MRI", "Structural connectivity", "Tractography"], "IndexKeywords": ["Algorithms", "Animals", "Brain", "Brain Mapping", "Diffusion Tensor Imaging", "Humans", "Image Processing, Computer-Assisted", "Macaca", "Models, Neurological", "Nerve Fibers", "Pattern Recognition, Automated"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-85022177804", "SubjectAreas": [["Neurology", "NEUR", "2808"], ["Cognitive Neuroscience", "NEUR", "2805"]], "AuthorData": {"55295726500": {"Name": "Bastiani M.", "AuthorID": "55295726500", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (WIN) - Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), University of Oxford"}, "57205178388": {"Name": "Cottaar M.", "AuthorID": "57205178388", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (WIN) - Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), University of Oxford"}, "8069852700": {"Name": "Behrens T.E.", "AuthorID": "8069852700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (WIN) - Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), University of Oxford"}, "25626182700": {"Name": "Jbabdi S.", "AuthorID": "25626182700", "AffiliationID": "60002634, 60026851", "AffiliationName": "Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroscience (WIN) - Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB), University of Oxford"}, "16234548300": {"Name": "Sotiropoulos S.N.", "AuthorID": "16234548300", "AffiliationID": "60015138", "AffiliationName": "Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham"}, "6701733652": {"Name": "Dikranian K.", "AuthorID": "6701733652", "AffiliationID": "60010261", "AffiliationName": "Department of Neuroscience, Washington University"}, "36026494700": {"Name": "Ghosh A.", "AuthorID": "36026494700", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science & Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "36088339000": {"Name": "Zhang H.", "AuthorID": "36088339000", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science & Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}, "7402830766": {"Name": "Alexander D.C.", "AuthorID": "7402830766", "AffiliationID": "60022148", "AffiliationName": "Department of Computer Science & Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London"}}}
