In vitro studies of yeast vacuole fusion and evidence from worms, flies, zebrafish and mice suggested that V 0 interacts with the SNARE machinery for membrane fusion, that it promotes the induction of hemifusion and that this activity requires physical presence of V 0 rather than its proton pump activity. A recent in vivo study in yeast has challenged these interpretations, concluding that fusion required solely lumenal acidification but not the V 0 sector itself. Here, we identify the reasons for this discrepancy and reconcile it. We find that acute pharmacological or physiological inhibition of V-ATPase pump activity de-acidifies the vacuole lumen in living yeast cells within minutes. Time-lapse microscopy revealed that de-acidification induces vacuole fusion rather than inhibiting it. Cells expressing mutated V 0 subunits that maintain vacuolar acidity were blocked in this fusion. Thus, proton pump activity of the V-ATPase negatively regulates vacuole fusion in vivo. Vacuole fusion in vivo does, however, require physical presence of a fusion-competent V 0 sector.", "AuthorKeywords": null, "IndexKeywords": ["Acids", "Biological Transport", "Membrane Fusion", "Membranes", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "SNARE Proteins", "Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases", "Vacuoles"], "DocumentType": "Journal", "PublicationStage": null, "OpenAccess": 1, "EID": "2-s2.0-84976884429", "SubjectAreas": [["Multidisciplinary", "MULT", "1000"]], "AuthorData": {"24475996700": {"Name": "Desfoug\u00e8res Y.", "AuthorID": "24475996700", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne"}, "24451216500": {"Name": "Vavassori S.", "AuthorID": "24451216500", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne"}, "26028050300": {"Name": "Rompf M.", "AuthorID": "26028050300", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne"}, "6505568319": {"Name": "Gerasimaite R.", "AuthorID": "6505568319", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne"}, "36127768200": {"Name": "Mayer A.", "AuthorID": "36127768200", "AffiliationID": "60000239", "AffiliationName": "Department of Biochemistry, University of Lausanne"}}}
